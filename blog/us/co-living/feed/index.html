<p>Living with roommates offers great fun and some unique budget challenges. Everyone wants to save money, but it can be tricky when you&#8217;re sharing space and expenses.</p>



<p>Simple changes in how you manage your household can lead to significant savings.</p>



<p>Think about energy conservation methods that lower bills while keeping things cozy. Collaborative grocery shopping brings down costs without skimping on quality. Plus, optimizing delivery routes means fewer trips and more cash left in your pocket.</p>



<p>Excited to dive into these smart strategies? Let’s go!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-energy-efficiency-simple-tips-for-reducing-utility-costs">1. Energy Efficiency: Simple Tips for Reducing Utility Costs</h2>



<p>Energy efficiency stands as a key factor in reducing home costs. Modest adjustments can translate into significant reductions in <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/how-to-save-on-electric-bill/" class="broken_link">your energy bills</a>. Begin with the switch to LED bulbs &#8211; they have greater longevity and consume less power than classic incandescent options.</p>



<p>Another move is to disconnect gadgets when idle, given that appliances continue to siphon electricity while switched off &#8211; a minor action with cumulative impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adjusting your thermostat can provide big savings too; even setting it a few degrees higher or lower based on the season helps. Additionally, using smart power strips can reduce phantom loads effortlessly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These practical tips not only save money but contribute positively to the environment as well. Embracing energy efficiency benefits everyone in the household!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-transportation-savings-rethinking-commutes-and-carpooling-options">2. Transportation Savings: Rethinking Commutes and Carpooling Options</h2>



<p>Rethinking transportation can lead to significant savings for roommates. Carpooling reduces fuel costs while fostering a sense of community among housemates. By coordinating schedules, you not only save money but also decrease wear on your vehicle.</p>



<p>Consider using shared delivery services as well. Combining errands allows you to <a href="https://getcircuit.com/teams/route-planning">improve delivery routes</a> and cut down on extra trips, making the most out of every journey.</p>



<p>Look into local apps that help with ride-sharing or planning joint grocery runs; this makes life easier and keeps expenses low.</p>



<p>These practical strategies make everyday logistics more efficient while boosting camaraderie within your household. You’ll notice the positive impact on both your budget and overall atmosphere!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-grocery-budgeting-how-to-shop-smart-with-roommates">3. Grocery Budgeting: How to Shop Smart with Roommates</h2>



<p><a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/finance/groceries-and-roommates-how-to-budget-better-roomi/" class="broken_link">Grocery shopping</a> can drain your budget if not managed well. To save money, create a shared grocery list before heading out. This helps avoid impulse buys and ensures everyone gets what they need.</p>



<p>Set a specific day each week for grocery runs, allowing roommates to plan meals together and split costs efficiently. You could even take turns shopping duties to share the responsibility.</p>



<p>Consider buying in bulk for non-perishable items; it often leads to savings over time. Don’t forget about local farmers&#8217; markets for fresh produce at lower prices.</p>



<p>Finally, using meal prep techniques keeps food waste down and makes cooking easier during busy weeks. By working together on groceries, you’ll keep expenses low while enjoying shared meals!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-meal-planning-together-saving-money-and-time-on-food-prep">4. Meal Planning Together: Saving Money and Time on Food Prep</h2>



<p>Effective meal planning is a game-changer for roommates looking to save money. By preparing meals in advance, you reduce food waste and ensure everyone enjoys home-cooked options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Start by setting aside time each week for meal prep sessions. Each roommate can pitch in ideas for recipes they love, making it fun and inclusive.</p>



<p>Batch cooking equips you to whip up sizeable quantities for later storage or freezing, slashing your daily kitchen labor. Align your shopping list with the meal plan to adhere firmly to your budget.</p>



<p>Finally, label meals with dates; this helps keep track of freshness while avoiding any last-minute takeout temptations. Meal planning not only saves cash but also brings everyone together over shared culinary adventures!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-shared-household-supplies-stocking-up-without-breaking-the-bank">5. Shared Household Supplies: Stocking Up Without Breaking the Bank</h2>



<p>Pooling resources for household supplies can significantly cut costs. Rather than each housemate purchasing separate supplies, build a shared reserve of necessities such as toilet paper, cleaning agents, and personal care items.</p>



<p>Kick off this system by cataloging existing supplies in the household to prevent unnecessary replication. Next, establish a shared list of needed items and designate one person to handle purchases each month. This way, you benefit from bulk-buy discounts on frequently used products.</p>



<p>Rotate who manages the supply cabinet; it fosters teamwork and accountability. Additionally, consider online shopping platforms that offer bulk deals or subscription services for regular deliveries.</p>



<p>Sharing these expenses lightens the financial load while ensuring your living space stays well-stocked without overspending!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-entertainment-on-a-budget-affordable-fun-for-everyone">6. Entertainment on a Budget: Affordable Fun for Everyone</h2>



<p>Finding affordable entertainment options can enhance your living experience without straining your budget. Explore local events, like community festivals or free concerts; these provide great outings at no cost.</p>



<p>Host movie nights at home where each roommate brings snacks to share. This creates a fun atmosphere without expensive theater tickets. Game nights also offer bonding opportunities and often lead to hilarious moments.</p>



<p>Consider potluck dinners, where everyone contributes a dish &#8211; this allows you to enjoy diverse meals while keeping costs down.</p>



<p>Look into discounts for group activities, such as escape rooms or bowling alleys, which often have special rates for larger parties. By getting creative with entertainment choices, you’ll make lasting memories while saving money!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-diy-home-projects-enhancing-your-space-without-major-expenses">7. DIY Home Projects: Enhancing Your Space Without Major Expenses</h2>



<p>Taking on do-it-yourself home improvements can reshape your dwelling at minimal expense. Fundamental enhancements such as wall painting or installing new lighting fixtures can inject vibrancy into a space, sidestepping the cost of professional services.</p>



<p>Start with small projects that enhance functionality. Constructing additional shelving serves the dual purpose of tidying and customizing your living area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alternatively, giving furniture a new lease on life through upcycling is an economical choice; a fresh layer of paint or updated fittings can rejuvenate aged items.</p>



<p>YouTube brims with how-to videos catering to all levels of proficiency, simplifying the learning process. Rally your roommates to join in on these undertakings, promoting a spirit of collective ingenuity and cooperation. Investing time and effort into these improvements creates a cozy home everyone will enjoy!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-the-power-of-negotiation-finding-better-deals-on-services">8. The Power of Negotiation: Finding Better Deals on Services</h2>



<p>Negotiating for better deals on services can significantly reduce your household expenses. Start by reviewing monthly bills &#8211; utilities, internet, and streaming services often have hidden fees or outdated plans.</p>



<p>Contact providers directly to discuss potential discounts or bundle offers. Many companies appreciate customer loyalty and may provide lower rates if you ask.</p>



<p>Encourage roommates to join in negotiations; pooling together amplifies your voice and strengthens your position. Research competitors beforehand; knowing the market helps you present compelling arguments.</p>



<p>Additionally, consider leveraging social media platforms where companies respond promptly to inquiries. This visibility can lead to quicker resolutions or special promotions. With a little effort, negotiating savings becomes an accessible tool for managing shared living costs!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts-building-a-cost-effective-home-together">Final Thoughts: Building a Cost-Effective Home Together</h3>



<p>Fostering an economical living space hinges on the collective dedication and collaboration of all housemates. Through savvy approaches such as combined grocery purchases, coordinated meal preparation, and consolidating resources for home necessities, you stand to economize while fortifying communal bonds.</p>



<p>Engaging in DIY projects can enhance your space without draining your wallet. Remember to negotiate better deals on services as well; it’s often easier than you think!</p>



<p>Finally, prioritize open communication about finances and preferences to ensure everyone feels comfortable participating in decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With these steps in place, you can foster an enjoyable living situation that emphasizes financial awareness while making lasting memories together. Embrace the journey of cohabitation with enthusiasm &#8211; it’s all about balance!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living in a sharehouse can be a rewarding experience, offering both companionship and cost-saving benefits. However, with multiple people coming and going, it can also present unique security challenges. Ensuring your shared space is safe should be your top priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, there are practical steps you can take to enhance the safety of your home. From installing quality locks to utilizing smart technology and holding regular house meetings, these tips will help create a secure environment where everyone feels protected and at ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s explore ten essential strategies to safeguard your sharehouse effectively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-tips-on-securing-your-sharehouse">10 Tips on Securing Your Sharehouse</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-install-quality-locks">1. Install Quality Locks</h3>



<p>Having quality locks on all entry points is crucial for your safety in a shared house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure each door has a strong deadbolt, as these are much harder to tamper with than standard locks. It&#8217;s also wise to change the locks whenever someone moves out, reducing the risk of unauthorized access by previous tenants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might consider consulting professional services like <a href="https://mammothsecurity.com/">Mammoth Security Inc.</a>, which offers commercial security solutions for businesses but also provides solutions that can be adapted for residential needs.</p>



<p>Remember, installing high-quality locks isn&#8217;t just about keeping intruders out &#8211; it&#8217;s about providing peace of mind for everyone living there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-use-smart-technology">2. Use Smart Technology</h3>



<p>Integrating smart technology into your sharehouse can enhance security. Smart cameras and alarm systems allow you to monitor the property remotely through your phone. <a href="https://soundhub.io/blog/different-types-of-speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart speakers</a> can also be incorporated to control other smart home devices and improve the living experience. This ensures you can keep an eye on things at all times, providing added peace of mind.</p>



<p>Motion sensor lights around entry points can also deter potential intruders by making it hard for them to approach unnoticed. Features such as keyless entry systems and smart locks offer convenient ways to secure the house without worrying about&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/guide-to-different-types-of-apartment-keys/" class="broken_link">lost keys</a>. Implementing these technologies creates a safer, more controllable environment for everyone in the sharehouse.&nbsp;If you’re looking for a comprehensive smart home system, check out Cybernews <a href="https://cybernews.com/best-home-security-systems/vivint-review/" class="broken_link">review of Vivint</a>, one of the top-rated options for intelligent security solutions.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%"></div>
</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-organize-regular-meetings">3. Organize Regular Meetings</h3>



<p>Regular meetings with your housemates can be vital for maintaining a secure, shared living space. These gatherings offer an opportunity to discuss any security concerns or <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/3-expert-tips-protect-info-snooping-roommate/" class="broken_link">unusual activities</a> noticed around the property. Open communication helps ensure everyone is aware of potential risks and contributes to a collective sense of vigilance and responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During these meetings, you can establish house rules, such as always locking doors and windows when leaving the house, or not letting strangers in without informing others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussing emergency plans ensures everyone knows what to do in case of an incident. Consistent dialogue fosters teamwork and makes it easier to address any issues promptly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-pay-close-attention-to-windows-and-doors">4. Pay Close Attention to Windows and Doors</h3>



<p>Windows and doors are the most common entry points for intruders, so it&#8217;s vital to ensure they are secure. Start by installing sturdy locks on all windows and doors and make it a habit to lock them every time you leave the house or go to bed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider adding extra security features like sliding door jammers or window bars for added peace of mind. Regularly check for any signs of wear and tear, such as loose frames or broken latches, and address these issues promptly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simple measures like keeping windows locked when not in use can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized entry, making your sharehouse a safer place for everyone living there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-secure-valuables">5. Secure Valuables</h3>



<p>In a shared living environment, it&#8217;s crucial to take extra precautions in <a href="https://reolink.com/blog/where-to-store-valuables/">securing your personal belongings</a>. Utilize lockable storage units or safes within your room to keep valuable items like jewelry, electronics, and important documents protected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This not only prevents theft from housemates but also adds a layer of security in case someone breaks into the house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Always avoid leaving expensive items in common areas where they are more vulnerable. You might also consider labeling your personal items to deter any potential mix-ups or misunderstandings. Ultimately, securing your valuables ensures peace of mind and contributes to an overall sense of safety within the sharehouse.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-create-emergency-plans">6. Create Emergency Plans</h3>



<p>Creating well-thought-out emergency plans is essential for keeping everyone in your sharehouse safe. Start by establishing clear procedures for different situations, such as fires, break-ins, or medical emergencies. Make sure all housemates know where emergency exits are located and how to use fire extinguishers if necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s helpful to designate specific meeting spots outside the house in case evacuation becomes necessary. Regularly review and practice these plans so everyone feels confident about what to do when an incident occurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Establishing a shared contact list with important numbers, like local emergency services, adds another layer of preparedness. Proactive planning can make all the difference in managing crises effectively and calmly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-keep-entryways-well-lit">7. Keep Entryways Well-Lit</h3>



<p>Ensuring your entryways are well-lit is a simple yet effective way to boost the security of your sharehouse. Bright outdoor lighting reduces hiding spots for would-be intruders and makes it easier for you and your housemates to see who&#8217;s approaching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Install lights at all main entrances, including front, back, and side doors. Motion sensor lights are an excellent option because they turn on automatically when someone gets close, saving energy while still providing protection.</p>



<p>Also, consider smart lighting systems that allow you to control the lights remotely. This way, you can keep entryways lit even if you&#8217;re not home. A bright, well-lit entrance acts as a deterrent and provides peace of mind.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-know-your-housemates-guests">8. Know Your Housemates’ Guests</h3>



<p>Knowing who your housemates are inviting over plays a significant role in maintaining your sharehouse’s security. It’s crucial to foster open communication about guests, as it ensures that everyone in the household is aware of who should and shouldn’t be inside the home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Establishing guidelines for informing each other about expected visitors helps prevent any surprises. Plus, recognizing unfamiliar faces or identifying friends of your housemates makes it easier to spot potential intruders. This collective awareness fosters a more secure environment.</p>



<p>&nbsp;By staying informed and understanding each other&#8217;s social circles, you contribute to a trusting atmosphere where every resident can feel safe and comfortable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-get-to-know-your-neighbors-nbsp">9. Get to Know Your Neighbors&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Building a relationship with your neighbors is an underrated yet crucial aspect of home security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you know the people living around you, it creates a sense of community and mutual responsibility. Friendly neighbors are more likely to keep an eye out for unusual activity and can alert you if they notice anything suspicious.</p>



<p>Take the time to introduce yourself and engage in casual conversations now and then. Establishing this rapport means you can count on them to pick up your mail when you&#8217;re away or potentially even check on the house. Fostering these connections transforms strangers into unofficial guardians of your shared space, enhancing overall safety for everyone involved.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-conduct-regular-maintenance-nbsp">10. Conduct Regular Maintenance&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Regular maintenance is key to ensuring the security measures in your sharehouse remain effective. Over time, locks can wear down, security systems can become outdated, and small issues can escalate if not addressed promptly. Make it a habit to routinely check all entry points, including doors and windows, for any signs of damage or tampering.</p>



<p>Test your alarm systems and security cameras periodically to ensure they are functioning correctly. Don&#8217;t forget about outdoor areas; trim back any overgrown bushes or trees that could serve as hiding spots for intruders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staying on top of these tasks not only maintains the safety of your home but also helps prevent costly repairs down the line.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-how-you-secure-a-shared-space">This is How You Secure a Shared Space</h2>



<p>Securing your shared house is not just about protecting physical property &#8211; it&#8217;s about creating a space where everyone can feel safe and comfortable. By implementing these strategies, you cultivate a secure environment that benefits all housemates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t wait until something happens to take action; start making these changes today. Discuss these tips with your housemates, invest in the necessary tools, and stay vigilant together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your shared home should be a sanctuary for everyone living there, and taking these simple steps can make a significant difference. Peace of mind begins with proactive measures!</p>

<p>Most importantly, just be yourself and ask all questions important to your own well being. But also remember to be prepared to answer the questions you ask, for it to feel like a healthy conversation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lifestyle</h2>



<p>Asking about your roommate&#8217;s lifestyle begs the question: How could it possibly affect you whether they like to stay home or go out on the weekends, right? (Unless you’re an&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">antisocial mouse</a>&nbsp;of course.)</p>



<p>But well, these potential roommate questions are important to get to know them better and to get a feel of what it&#8217;s like if you decide to live with them. If they have a large circle of friends that they host every weekend, your personal space could be affected, if that’s not something you like doing on the weekends.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if they happen to mention the exact same things you like to do, then you’d know you’ve found the one, potentially!</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>What do your weekends look like? How about during the weekdays?</li>



<li>What do you do for work? Do you work from home?</li>



<li>Do you have a regular exercise routine? Or practice any sports?</li>



<li>What&#8217;s your worst habit?</li>



<li>Do you smoke or do drugs? How often?</li>



<li>Do you have any allergies or dietary restrictions?</li>



<li>Do you have any pets? Plans to get any pets?</li>



<li>How often do you travel?</li>



<li>Do you prefer a quiet and calm living environment or are you comfortable with occasional gatherings or parties?</li>



<li>How often do you cook at home?</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sleeping schedule &amp; cleaning habits</h2>



<p>Understanding the habits and preferences of your potential roommate when it comes to their sleeping schedule and their approach to tidiness can be pivotal in ensuring a harmonious and comfortable co-living situation. It&#8217;s often beneficial to navigate these discussions with a sense of openness, starting from a place of personal sharing. For instance, you might consider initiating the conversation by candidly discussing your own <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/dealing-with-a-roommates-obsessive-need-to-clean-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">cleaning behavior</a>, which could naturally lead to a dialogue about what cleanliness means in your daily life.</p>



<p>By doing so, not only do you set a tone of transparency and vulnerability, but you also provide a safe space for your prospective roommate to share their cleaning standards and expectations.</p>



<p>Discussing something as personal as cleaning habits can be delicate; however, framing it within the context of your own experiences and values tends to make the conversation feel less like an interrogation and more like a collaborative effort to ensure both you and your roommate can enjoy a clean, organized home that meets both of your needs.</p>



<p>Just keep in mind that not everyone will be a neat freak, and not everyone is a slob either. What you should be looking for is the sweet spot in the middle.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>What conditions do you require to sleep?</li>



<li>What time do you generally wake up and go to bed?</li>



<li>How do you think we should handle household chores? Like cleaning the common areas?</li>



<li>How would you describe your feelings towards cleaning? Are you messy or neat?</li>



<li>What household chore do you like the least?</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Privacy &amp; boundaries</h2>



<p>Establishing boundaries is important in any kind of relationship. Most especially with potential roommates, you should have an open discussion on what privacy and sharing means to the both of you.</p>

<p>Take a look at these privacy questions to ask potential roommates that will eventually lead to a peaceful household in the future (hopefully!).</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you have any references?</li>



<li>How do you feel about sharing stuff (aside from expenses), like kitchen and cleaning equipment?</li>



<li>What are your deal breakers? Do you have any pet peeves?</li>



<li>What do you feel about visitors or guests in the apartment? Do you like having friends over?</li>



<li>What are your feelings about overnight guests?</li>



<li>Are you in a romantic relationship?</li>



<li>Do you prefer to have separate storage spaces for our own food or do you want to share a common pantry?</li>

<p>A bolder way to put any financial question to ask your potential roommates would be, can I be assured&nbsp;<a href="https://www.splitwise.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the rent</a>&nbsp;will come on time? This one’s a major ask, so make sure you put it the best way possible. It&#8217;s also important to address any questions about splitting and sharing to avoid any conflict that can happen in the future.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>How much is your rent now?</li>



<li>What do you think is the best way to handle paying rent and utilities?</li>



<li>In situations where a roommate might be facing financial difficulties, how would you handle it?</li>



<li>Are you interested in sharing groceries and cooking meals together occasionally?</li>



<li>Have you ever paid rent late before? If yes, why and how did you make up for it?</li>



<li>Can you put down a deposit?</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Room and roommate expectations</h2>



<p>Yes, people looking for roommates, it’s time to ask about the ‘ex.’ Just like a potential or current significant other refusing to talk about their past is a major red flag, it&#8217;s the same with a potential roommate. Because if they’re cordial and easy to live with, they’ll have a couple of good stories, and some funny ones, and maybe even some&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/help-my-roommate-is-driving-me-up-the-wall-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">challenging ones</a>&nbsp;to share.</p>



<p>But if all they talk about are bad experiences, or if they shy away from the question, it could be a potential red flag that you should definitely watch out for. Try and be as diplomatic as you can when you go for these types of questions to ask potential roommates.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Have you had a roommate before?</li>



<li>How was your experience living with others? What did you like and dislike about it?</li>



<li>Are you still friends or in contact with your former roommates?</li>



<li>What are you looking for in a potential roommate?</li>



<li>Is it important to know your neighbors?</li>



<li>Who gets the biggest room when moving in?</li>



<li>How long do you plan to stay?</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communication styles</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s important to ask your potential roommate about how they go about confrontations or conflicts in the apartment. Do they tend to leave passive-aggressive notes? or do they prefer to talk things out face-to-face? With this information, you&#8217;ll be able to gauge if you&#8217;ll work things out should a conflict happen.</p>



<p>Once you’ve asked the major questions you wanted to ask, let them have a go at describing what they’re looking for too. Listen carefully and try to really understand what they’re saying when they’re talking about their choice of potential roommates.</p>



<p>And now like any other interview, once you’ve had a good chat, let them break free from your questions. Ask them what else they’d like for you to know, or what they’d like to know about you.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>What&#8217;s your confrontation style?</li>



<li>Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? Do you think it&#8217;s important to interact with each other every day?</li>



<li>Do you tend to leave notes?</li>



<li>Are you more of a text or call person?</li>



<li>Anything else I should know about you?</li>
</ol>

<p>When it comes to living with an international roommate, the experience is like a coin with two sides—each with its own set of perks and challenges.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s chat about what makes this journey so special, and what bumps you might find along the way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pros</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cultural enrichment:</strong> Imagine celebrating Diwali, Christmas, and Chinese New Year all in one apartment! Living with someone from a different culture turns your home into a mini global village. You get a firsthand look at traditions, foods, and daily practices that books or documentaries can barely do justice to.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Language practice:</strong> Ever wanted to learn Spanish, French, or Mandarin but found classes too dull or expensive? Well, if your roommate speaks a different language, it’s a great opportunity to practice or learn a new language. It&#8217;s much more engaging and fun to learn by conversing daily than through books or apps alone</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Expanding your perspectives:</strong> Discussing world events with someone from another country can open your eyes to different perspectives. It encourages open-mindedness and can challenge preconceived notions you might have about other cultures.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>New friends and connections:</strong>: Having a foreign roommate often means they might have friends from other countries too. This can expand your social circle and introduce you to a diverse group of people you might not have met otherwise. It can be particularly valuable if you’re looking into working or studying abroad.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cons</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Different daily routines:</strong> Your idea of early might be their idea of a sleep-in. Maybe your roommate comes from a culture where dinner at 10 PM is the norm, while you’re used to eating by 6 PM. These differences in daily routines can be quirky at first, but frustrating if not navigated carefully.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Communication hiccups:</strong> Even if you both speak the same language, certain nuances and expressions can lead to misunderstandings. Sometimes, what’s considered a harmless joke in one culture can be a rude remark in another. It’s all about navigating these nuances with care and a good dose of humor.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Privacy issues:</strong> In some cultures, it’s normal to enter someone’s room without knocking, while in others, such privacy invasions could lead to World War III in the apartment! Setting clear boundaries that respect both your privacy is key.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Household habits:</strong> Cultural differences can extend to everyday habits and lifestyles, from cleaning standards to cooking smells, noise levels, and even the way you spend your leisure time. What’s normal in one culture (like leaving dishes overnight) might be a no-go in another. This might require adjustments and compromises that not everyone is comfortable with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, here are some practical tips to help you navigate the rewarding yet complex dynamics of living with someone from a different cultural background.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Explore with your international roommate</h3>



<p>A new city or country often means new stores and chains you don’t recognize. For your international roommate, it could be quite a culture shock.</p>



<p>Take time to get to know the city together. Find a favorite grocery store, try a couple of happy hours, and just explore the neighborhood with your roommate even if you aren’t best friends (yet).</p>



<p>After you’re done raiding the local farmer’s market, schedule a night to&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/roommate-bonding-activities/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">try cooking a new dish</a>&nbsp;—maybe you’ll discover a new favorite you’ve never heard of before!</p>



<p>Trust us — while it seems like a small gesture, it will help your new roommate feel at home.</p>



<p>This goes both ways, though! They might have some killer recs for you too. Never tried Ethiopian food? Who better to show you exactly how to eat that spongy bread than a local?</p>



<p>And if you and your international roommate have any sort of language barrier, just remember: Food is the universal language.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Share cultural norms</h3>



<p>When it comes to sharing stuff, it’s always&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">best to ask</a>&nbsp;— whether it’s food or toiletries, don’t just assume it’s yours to use.</p>



<p>Hopefully, you’re doing that anyway, but sharing habits aren’t always so common sense. Americans, for example, might be more casual about “borrowing” something than someone from abroad.</p>



<p>Wherever you stand on the sharing thing, it’s best to talk about it early on to avoid any misunderstandings on either of your part. The last thing you want is to sour your relationship with your international roommate over some grapes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Be&nbsp;crystal clear about what’s ‘included’</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s super important to be transparent about what&#8217;s included in your living arrangement.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t just about the rent and bills—though those are key—it&#8217;s about all the little (and not so little) things that can cause misunderstandings if they&#8217;re not spelled out from the get-go.</p>



<p>For example, let&#8217;s talk about the basics like utilities. Are all utilities included in the rent, or will you and your roommate be splitting the costs of things like electricity, water, and internet? This should be laid out clearly to avoid any surprises when the bills start rolling in.</p>



<p>But beyond the financials, you should also discuss what living essentials are shared and what aren&#8217;t. Will you be sharing food, or is everyone on their own for meals?</p>



<p>What about cleaning supplies or bathroom essentials like toilet paper—will these be communal expenses, or is everyone expected to pitch in separately?</p>



<p>And here&#8217;s one that often gets overlooked: space usage. Be clear about which areas are communal and which are private. Can you both use the living room for hanging out or hosting friends? Who gets which shelves in the fridge?</p>



<p>These might seem like small details, but they can lead to big headaches if they&#8217;re not hashed out upfront.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Use a good app</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re moving to a new country and need some navigating the rental landscape, having the right tools can make all the difference.</p>



<p>This is where a reliable international roommate finder like <a href="https://roomiapp.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Roomi</a> steps in. Roomi isn’t just another platform to find a place to live; it connects you to a vibrant community of renters who are actively looking to share their living spaces.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don’t assume anything</h3>



<p>Assumptions can be the quickest route to misunderstandings. When you live with someone from a different cultural background, try to avoid jumping to conclusions based on your cultural norms.</p>



<p>For example, if your roommate doesn’t share much about their personal life, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re unfriendly. Some cultures value privacy and might take longer to open up.</p>



<p>Always ask and communicate instead of assuming; this will help you avoid many potential conflicts and help you understand your roommate’s actions and responses better.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Make intros</h3>



<p>Hopefully, you and your new international roommate can find some common ground to let a friendship bloom.</p>



<p>But even if you’re not the best of buds, you might be able to introduce them to their next BFF — making you Roommate of the Year!</p>



<p>So get on your Facebook/Instagram/X (or any other social media platform you use) and make some intros. It&#8217;ll be the easiest thing you can do with the largest payoff.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Avoid using stereotypes</h3>



<p>It’s also important for you to recognize and avoid relying on stereotypes when interacting with your international roommate.</p>



<p>It’s way better to get to know your roommate as a person. Ask them about their interests, their family, what a typical day looked like for them back home, or their favorite music.</p>



<p>You’ll likely find that they’re much more than any stereotype could cover. Plus, this kind of open curiosity may help you build a more genuine and respectful relationship.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve moved in with your new roommate, and things are mostly going great. But then, little things start popping up—maybe it&#8217;s dishes left in the sink longer than you&#8217;d like, or the bathroom becomes a free-for-all during your morning routine.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to think, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll just let it slide this time,&#8221; but those little annoyances can quickly snowball into major irritations if they aren&#8217;t addressed.</p>



<p>The trick here is to bring up issues while they&#8217;re still small. You might worry about coming off as naggy, but it&#8217;s really about keeping your shared space comfortable for everyone.</p>



<p>If you notice something, say something (in a polite way, of course.) Your roommate might not even realize they&#8217;re doing something that bugs you. People have different living habits, and what’s obvious to you might not be to someone else.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Be patient</h3>



<p>Living with a foreign roommate may test your patience in all sorts of ways. Think about it: each of us grows up with our own set of norms, and it can take a minute to adjust when someone else’s norms crash into ours.</p>



<p>However, showing a bit of patience can make things much easier. It allows everyone some breathing room to adjust and find common ground. Remember — just like you’re adapting to their quirks, they’re adjusting to yours.</p>



<p>Showing patience gives you time to understand and respect your roommate&#8217;s needs and preferences and vice versa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>And there you have it! Living with an international roommate goes beyond just sharing a space—it&#8217;s about sharing experiences, learning from each other, and growing together in unexpected ways.</p>



<p>With these tips in your back pocket, you&#8217;re all set to make the most of this unique living arrangement.</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>For better or for worse, co-living with another person and sharing your living space can leave a lasting impact. The facts about roommates and co-living with them are that it’s not easy&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/9-reasons-why-living-with-a-roommate-is-awesome-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">but it does have its perks</a>.</p>



<p>Apart from companionship, co-living with a roommate helps you save money as you can split bills and other utilities with another person. So when you find yourself in a co-living situation, you need to be aware of the facts about roommates and the types of roommates and personalities that you’ll see.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-14-types-of-roommates-you-ve-probably-come-across">14 Types of Roommates You&#8217;ve Probably Come Across</h2>



<p>Here are 14 types of roommates you&#8217;re sure to come across, or have already had an encounter with in the past.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-the-neat-freak">1. The Neat Freak</h2>



<p>The neat freak comes with unexpected cleaning standards (think dust free picture frames and a labeled kitchen cabinet). These types of roommates are so dialled into the itty-bitty details, and it can be fun (for a time!), but if you’ve been living on a different planet and haven’t watched&nbsp;<em>Friends</em>, how will you learn about managing your real-life Monica Gellar at home?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s mostly easy to deal with the type of roommate who like things clean and organized. The trick is to make sure you do your part to keep common areas clean. You can trash your room all you want, but never let the mess go out of your own space. If you&#8217;re sharing the room, then your junk should only be on your bed.</p>



<p>Look at the bright side, appreciate your sparkling apartment, and do your bit to keep it looking beautiful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Clingy Roommates</h2>



<p>Making new friends is important, but some roommates tend to be too friendly that they become &#8216;clingy&#8217;. They invade your personal space and can even act as your shadow. Sharing a co-living space assumes a license for the clinger to be friends with your friends and go wherever you go.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make boundaries when living with a clinger</h3>



<p>With the clinger type of roommates, try to keep your private life private and don&#8217;t share too much. Be gentle in drawing lines, as they might throw a fuss and create a self-pity situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The Quiet One</h2>



<p>With this type of roommate, there aren&#8217;t any greetings and they don’t talk unless you ask them a question. They’re in and out of the house like a stealthy cat. Don’t expect more than a wave or a subtle nod from them.</p>



<p>When living with <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">quiet roommates</a>, it&#8217;s best to leave a written note if you wish to communicate.&nbsp;You&#8217;re actually considered lucky if you&#8217;re living with quiet roommates, as compared to some of the others in this list.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The Party Animal</h2>



<p>This is the type of roommate who never goes to class unless surrounded by fraternal brothers or sorority sisters. Their favorite time is late at night when they’re partying, and they come back home with a crowd of people. They&#8217;re the extroverted version of the clingers who are often shy.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make house rules that limit guests</h3>



<p>To deal with this type of roommate, talk to them about it in a matter of fact tone with no overkill. Social butterflies always have a crowd buzzing around them, so try to setting boundaries in the apartment. Maybe you could limit guests to only stay until a particular time in the night or to tone it down after 10 P.M. because we all need our beauty sleep.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The Lover</h2>



<p>Since you’ve started living with them you’ve seen a a record breaking number of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/what-to-do-dont-like-roommates-partner/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">individuals</a> walk out of their room every morning. And sometimes this type of roommate carries their display of affection outside their bedroom.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Try to avoid being embarrassed when living with the romantic type</h3>



<p>Living with a romantic type of roommate means you need to have an unspoken code before you walk in the room, like a hat on a doorknob. If you still happen to walk in on them during an awkward lip-smacking session (or worse), suggest that they should have date nights someplace else other than your crash pad. They&#8217;ll get the picture.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. The Passive Aggressive One</h2>



<p>One of the reasons people behave passive aggressively is the fear of direct display of anger. The way to communicate with them is to keep it simple and to be assertive. It’s best to avoid gossip and huffing and puffing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Keep a check on the words you use</h3>



<p>The best way to communicate with passive aggressive roommates is through written notes. In case their random notes surpass your patience levels, you can join them at their own game. Leave a post-it note: <em>“Had your leftover pizza as I was hungry. It was yummy.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Slobs</h2>



<p><a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/help-roomate-is-a-slob/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">The slobs</a> are one of the most difficult types of roommates to live with. They have no basic hygiene or cleaning habits. They’re easy to spot – think dirty clothes piled up, food wrappers, unwashed dishes, and always in need of a shower.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="21083" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/10-different-roommates-you-might-end-up-with-roomi/attachment/slobs/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?fit=2250%2C1500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2250,1500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Slobs" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Slobs" class="wp-image-21083" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=1250%2C834&amp;ssl=1 1250w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/young-woman-watching-movie-in-headphones-in-messy-room-3795291/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Pexels</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Honestly, you can’t really do anything about them</h3>



<p>One thing you need to know about slobs is that they make those choices consciously, so a conversation may not kick them into action. The best way to go around this is to create boundaries for their mess, and deal with them as you would with a reverse of the neat freak. If creepy crawlers are coming up to your space or if you cannot do without an odor mask, talk to your resident assistant (RA) or start looking for a new place.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Night Owls</h2>



<p>This type of roommate finds themselves most productive when everyone goes to sleep. The night owl roommate lives with you but has the routine of a resident country on the opposite side of the globe.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s nice about this type of roomie is if you need someone to wake you up in the middle of the night, you can count on them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. The Hermit</h2>



<p>The live-ins love their room so much that they probably don&#8217;t come out of there. They even skip class or work to watch TV or play a video game in peace. Hermits are similar to the quiet ones, but hermits value their privacy and personal space more. Usually, this type of roommate engages in solitary activities, like reading or doing their own hobbies in their own space.</p>



<p>The best way to deal with hermits is to tell them that you need space to study or work, relax, and have friends come over. Come up with a compromised way of space sharing. If you have separate bedrooms and rarely see this roommate, consider it a blessing. Just keep an eye out to see if your roommate&#8217;s still <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/spotting-telltale-signs-of-anxiety-in-your-roommate-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">doing okay or not.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Types of roommates who “borrow” a lot</h2>



<p>These are the type of roommates who like to “borrow” your things. The items may not be generally expensive, but the habit is annoying.</p>



<p>Try to be honest with your your roommate and tell them how their behavior makes you feel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Give them a taste of their own medicine</strong></h3>



<p>Else try and behave like them and text them, “Can I borrow your perfume?” It might help.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">11. The Athlete</h2>



<p>Having an athlete as a roommate can be good and bad. Good because you can be inspired to hit the gym or try out some new sports, and bad because there could be a lot of workout gear in the apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">12. Mother/Father Figure Roomie</h2>



<p>These types of roommates are always looking out for you. The Mother/Father figure always ask, &#8220;are you okay?&#8221;, &#8220;have you eaten?&#8221;, &#8220;why are you home late?&#8221;. But don&#8217;t get them wrong, they aren&#8217;t overbearing, they just genuinely care about you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">13. The Chef</h2>



<p>Living with an aspiring chef, or just a person who knows how to make gourmet chicken nuggets, will have you eating good at the apartment. The only downside is that the kitchen can get messy, and your roommate may need a helping hand. Another could be hearing pots and pans at three in the morning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">14. The Roommate Turned Bestie</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s not always that you get a roommate and best friend in one, but sometimes luck is just on your side. These types of roommates give you a feeling like you&#8217;ve known each other for years, when in reality, it&#8217;s only been a few months.</p>

<p>We, at Roomi, understand that living with one or more roommates is not always easy and it can often be a necessity when you can’t afford a house or apartment on your own.</p>



<p>Sharing a home with the right roommates can definitely be a lot of fun, but it&#8217;s also important to consider that roommate harassment issues are very real. While there are a host of roommate harassment laws that you could prepare yourself with, there are other know-hows that could help you.</p>



<p>You can avoid a lot of headaches by carefully selecting housemates.&nbsp;You can also prepare a written roommate agreement that covers the day-to-day details of living together.&nbsp;This may include how you will resolve any problems that come up, and knowing your legal rights as a roommate. Here’s what you need to know about resolving a situation with a hostile roommate. As well as all the legal rights you have living with roommates!</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sign-roommate-agreement/189/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Why Should I Sign a Roommate Agreement?</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-roommate-harassment-laws">What are Roommate Harassment Laws?</h2>



<p>Well, there can be a wide range of things that can be considered roommate harassment. Additionally, the issues are fairly minor and easily resolvable. But other times they aren&#8217;t. This might require you to know your legal rights as a roommate and intervention from law enforcement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-settling-minor-roommate-disputes">Settling minor roommate disputes</h3>



<p>Even with a clear written roommate agreement, disputes might arise. Communication is key to a quick resolution. Here are some points you can do:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Speak up if you’re upset by something your roommate (or a roommate’s guest or pet) did or didn’t do, said, or didn’t say. Calmly explaining why you’re upset might also help. Be specific and let your roommate know how to keep the peace in the future.</li>



<li>Including a section on dispute resolution in your roommate agreement, or perhaps an agreement to try mediation on specific issues might help.</li>
</ul>



<p>Technically, all roommates should sign the rental agreement or lease. A lease makes you co-tenants. Legally speaking, this means that each of you will be individually responsible for paying the entire rent each month. As well as fulfilling other rental obligations.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-i-do-if-roommate-harassment-is-getting-out-of-hand">What can I do if roommate harassment is getting out of hand?</h3>



<p>If your roommate is on the lease or other recognized elements of residency, such as utility bills in their name, or if they receive mail at this location, it gets far more complex.</p>



<p>For example, to evict a roommate who has established residency in New York, you must use the <a href="https://nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/holdover_roommate.shtml" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">court system</a> to evict your roommate, even if he or she isn&#8217;t listed on the lease as a tenant.</p>



<p>One good way to evict your roommate is to start writing a letter, asking your roommate to leave. As per most roommate harassment laws, putting your request in writing creates a paper trail for if and when you go to court.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-i-evict-my-roommate">Can I evict my Roommate?</h3>



<p>Roommate eviction depends on whether your roommate is on the lease or not. If they aren&#8217;t on the lease, they&#8217;re considered a &#8216;month-to-month&#8217; tenant, so you don&#8217;t have to go to court. You just have to give them at least 30 days to vacate.</p>



<p>However, if they&#8217;re on the lease, you have to file a roommate holdover proceeding. According to New York state law, you can file for your roommate to be evicted if you&#8217;re the master tenant. But if both of you are on the lease, it&#8217;s in the hands of your landlord.</p>

<p>To start a case, you have to file an eviction lawsuit with the New York City housing court to start an official eviction proceeding.&nbsp;Threatening your roommate will only hurt in this case as you&#8217;ll be the one in legal trouble as a result of that.&nbsp;The next step is to call the police and ask them to forcibly remove your roommate if they remain in your home more than 72 hours after receiving the eviction notice.</p>



<p>After all of that occurs and your day in court arrives, come prepared with all communication that has occurred between you and your roommate, as well as the lease which shows that you are the rightful owner of the property and that your roommate has no legal grounds on which to stay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this is a costly and messy process no one wants to go through, the only way to have complete rights to stay is if you&#8217;re the one whose name is on the lease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roommate Harassment Laws: What To Do About It</h2>



<p>If the roommate harassment in question constitutes violence, here’s what you can do.</p>



<p>Even if you aren&#8217;t romantically involved with your roommate, legal counsel or help from a women’s shelter can help you determine if your relationship falls under the category of domestic violence. To benefit from extended protection to victims of domestic violence, check with local law enforcement or a women’s shelter regarding state laws applicable to your situation. Some laws that may apply include the following:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Anti-discrimination status and eviction protection</h3>



<p>In many states, it&#8217;s illegal to discriminate against someone who&#8217;s a victim of domestic violence. So, a landlord can&#8217;t refuse to rent (or terminate) solely because the person is a victim of domestic violence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Early termination rights</h3>



<p>Usually, a victim of domestic violence can end a lease with notice (often 30 days). States typically require that the tenant provide proof (such as a protective order) of their status as a domestic violence victim.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Limits on rental clauses</h3>



<p>In some states, landlords can&#8217;t include clauses that provide for termination, should a tenant call the police in the face of domestic violence, nor can landlords make tenants pay for the cost of such calls.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Section 8 tenants</h3>



<p>Domestic violence victims may evade regular relocation requirements if they have otherwise complied with other&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/section-8/tenants.page#:~:text=The%20Housing%20Choice%20Voucher%20program,annual%20income%20and%20family%20size.)**" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Section 8 requirements</a>, have moved to protect someone who is or has been a domestic violence victim, and “reasonably believed” that they were imminently threatened by harm from further violence.</p>



<p><strong>What are Section 8 Tenants?</strong></p>



<p>The Housing Choice Voucher program, also known as Section 8, is a federally funded program that assists eligible low- and moderate-income families to rent housing in the private market. Eligibility for this program is based on a family’s gross annual income and family size.</p>

<p>If your roommate has threatened or engaged in real physical violence against you, you can get a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.womenslaw.org/laws/general/restraining-orders" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Domestic Violence Temporary Restraining Order</a>&nbsp;from the court that asks for a residence exclusion order. This order will require your roommate to leave the apartment immediately.</p>



<p>The trickiest part about dealing with a dangerous roommate is that things that you want to happen immediately take a long time. The safest option would be for you to stop staying at your shared place from the time that you deliver a letter of notice until your roommate moves out. Even if this much precaution seems impossible, try to line up at least two different places where you can stay if you feel uncomfortable at home.</p>

<p>Life with a&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-im-stuck-coliving-with-roommates-i-dont-like-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">roommate</a>&nbsp;isn’t always rainbows and butterflies — even we’ll admit to that. But when you have to share a space with someone, it’s vital to find a way to get along. Even if that means looking past the stack of dirty dishes&nbsp;or overflowing garbage can. But when the little stuff becomes too much to handle for one party, it can create palpable tension that can quickly turn toxic.</p>



<p>Good communication is the key to a healthy roommate relationship, but if you’re getting bad vibes without a clear reason why, you might have a serious issue on your hands.&nbsp;We talked to an expert on common behaviors of a passive-aggressive roommate and how to deal if you’re living with one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-passive-aggression">What is Passive Aggression?</h3>



<p>Psychology professor and clinical psychologist&nbsp;<a href="http://psychology.nova.edu/faculty/profile/dorfman.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dr. William Dorfman</a>&nbsp;defines passive-aggressive behavior as a dishonest expression of anger and hostility — an indirect expression of feelings people don’t want to confront. The most serious implication of this behavior is that doesn’t directly solve problems but rather expresses resentment&nbsp;and disapproval, making it difficult to deal with or improve a situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-signs-of-a-passive-aggressive-roommate">What are the Signs of a Passive-Aggressive Roommate?</h2>



<p>Thirty-year-old blogger, Chloe, who prefers not to use her real name, knows what this feels like. She and a friend lived with a passive-aggressive roommate in a townhouse during her freshman year of college. She says their&nbsp;roommate regularly passive-aggressively found ways to be inconsiderate. Eventually, the situation escalated to the point they felt uncomfortable in their own home.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“He would leave messes, and we would have to clean up after him, but then he would complain about me to the third roommate or about her to me,” says. “It became very uncomfortable because we would end up just trying to avoid him to keep the peace. It was like the tension became our fourth roommate. It was this real thing that was always present. You aren’t home without comfort and feeling protected and safe. When that is stripped from you, you avoid home until it’s late. You have no peace, no comfort.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>While anyone can react to a difficult situation passive-aggressively, Dorfman says some consistent behaviors indicate it’s not&nbsp;someone simply blowing off steam.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“It’s inherently an interpersonal process and a personality trait.&nbsp;Sometimes, we even diagnose it in clinical psychology as a passive-aggressive personality disorder when it really characterizes a person, not just once in a while.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>To add, here are some common passive-aggressive behaviors that your roommate might exhibit along with strategies for dealing with them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-procrastination-on-chores">1. Procrastination on chores</h3>



<p>No matter how many times you ask your roommate to do something, they’ll make excuses until it becomes obvious that they’re not happy. They might&nbsp;say they’re going to do the dishes after you ask, but it never happens. Repetitive procrastination&nbsp;is likely an indication of not wanting to do something.</p>



<p>Dorfman says,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“We all procrastinate, but when you procrastinate with someone else, it affects the other person’s rights and they’re left with the problem.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-being-forgetful-and-late">2. Being forgetful and late</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive roommate consciously or unconsciously forgets what’s asked of them, or is constantly late. Lateness, according to Dorfman, is another way of saying &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take control of the situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>For example, you may ask your roommate to arrive home by a certain time so you can rest, but they’ll be late and say they forgot your request. Or they may forget that you asked them not to eat your food in the fridge. When your roommate makes it a habit&nbsp;to be inconsiderate, it can be a sure sign of passive aggressiveness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-silent-treatment">3. Silent treatment</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive roommate may also shut down when faced with conflict. Instead of talking about the issue, they express neither hostility nor honesty. Rather than negotiating to solve an uncomfortable situation, they give you the silent treatment.</p>



<p>Not talking, Chloe says, was one of the main issues in her roommate relationship. Looking back now, she says she’s more aware of what to look for.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“The person will either say nothing was wrong or lash out. Either way, I would try to bring a peaceful and calm environment to whatever forum you decide to have and just keep having communication lines open.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-actions-don-t-match-the-attitude">4. Actions don&#8217;t match the attitude</h3>



<p>Perhaps the most toxic passive-aggressive behavior is acting one way and feeling another. They come across as being insincere or “fake nice”. For example, your roommate might ask you to “pick up” some toilet paper from the store, but it eventually becomes a routine.&nbsp;Dorfman likens the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/coliving-101-help-my-roommate-talks-behind-my-back-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">situation</a>&nbsp;to someone stabbing you in the back while smiling to your face.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“Often people who are passive-aggressive have an obvious, gratuitous attitude toward you that is not consistent with the way they act,” Dorfman says. “If you’re smiling at someone and being very sweet and friendly, how can you be angry?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-your-roommate-doesn-t-have-a-good-reason-to-be-angry">5. Your roommate doesn’t have a good reason to be angry</h3>



<p>Not every passive-aggressive roommate necessarily procrastinates or is stubborn and manipulative. The root of the behaviors of your roommate could also be that they don’t like being limited by others. Before jumping to conclusions, you should consider this first.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“If you’re not doing anything to instill or create any frustration or resentment, they don’t need to act in a passive-aggressive way,” Dorfman says. “It’s only when they’re called upon to do something or they’re not getting their way. Rather than address that they’re frustrated, they shut down and become stubborn, quiet, and withdrawn.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“They keep on saying, ‘I’m going to do it’ and ‘I’m sorry,’ and yet you continue to feel resentful about them. So, when your feelings don’t match up and you’re left confused about how you should deal with this person, that’s one indication that it’s not necessarily you. You’re getting mixed messages from this person.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-backhanded-compliments">6. Backhanded compliments</h3>



<p>Backhanded compliments are comments or expressions that seem positive at first, but it&#8217;s actually an insult. These are also known as &#8220;non-compliments&#8221; or &#8220;disguised insults&#8221; as backhanded compliments are usually indirect and subtle.</p>



<p>Some examples of backhanded compliments are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When you get a new haircut and your roommate says, &#8220;your haircut makes your nose look smaller.&#8221;</li>



<li>You&#8217;re going out for the night and they say, &#8220;that&#8217;s a beautiful dress on you. I didn&#8217;t even realize it was you at first glance.&#8221;</li>



<li>When your roommate comments on how your room or personal space looks: &#8220;I wish I was as relaxed as you in this mess.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-being-sarcastic">7. Being sarcastic</h3>



<p>Having a sarcastic roommate can be tiresome if it gets too much. It&#8217;s similar to backhanded compliments in a way that both are verbal and indirect, but sarcastic comments are a bit more upfront than backhanded compliments.</p>



<p>Plus, sarcasm is usually with irony or mockery that can be hurtful, especially with roommates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-slamming-doors-intentionally">8. Slamming doors intentionally</h3>



<p>Another sign of having a passive-aggressive roommate is when they slam the doors to your apartment intentionally. For example, you had an argument, you told them off, or confronted them on something they did, then they suddenly leave the apartment then slam the door on their way out. It&#8217;s disrespectful and can disturb others living the apartment or even on the same floor, as the noise of the door slamming travels through the hallway.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-deal-with-a-passive-aggressive-roommate-tips-amp-tricks">How to Deal with a Passive-Aggressive Roommate: Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<p>It’s normal to feel angry when <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-to-set-in-apartments-for-rent-with-roommates/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dealing</a> with the behaviors of a passive-aggressive roommate. But the thing to keep in mind with passive-aggressive roommates is, you can&#8217;t change them.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“[You] can get them to stop eating their food a lot easier than they can get them to become more open with their anger and more responsible with their feelings,” Dorfman says. “You deal with the specific situation, not with the personality.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>As per Dorfman, some solutions to dealing with a passive-aggressive roommate are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tell your roommate you&#8217;re frustrated, ask them what&#8217;s going on, and discuss your concerns with them. But you should also be prepared for them to get defensive and shut down.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Talk to someone you trust who can see the situation objectively to get their perspective.</li>



<li>Try going to therapy or counseling to work things out if both are willing.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, the solutions depend on how volatile the behaviors of your roommate are.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“Passive-aggressive style is on a continuum; it’s not all or nothing. Certain people are more passive-aggressive than others, so I wouldn’t count anyone out who has a particular difficulty with someone,” Dorfman says. “You have to make the effort to try to resolve the issues and call somebody on what’s going on.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-solution-to-dealing-with-passive-aggressive-roommates">The Solution to Dealing with Passive-Aggressive Roommates</h2>



<p>Finding new roommates may be the solution to dealing with a passive-aggressive roommate. By seeking out individuals who are more communicative and considerate, you can create a more positive and harmonious living environment. Don&#8217;t let one negative experience discourage you from finding roommates who will bring joy and positivity to your home.</p>

<p>Adjusting to a roommate&nbsp;can be difficult enough, but when you’re saddled with a lazy roommate, coming back home can seem like a nightmare. As if work stress wasn’t enough, now you have to find time to complete your roommate’s chores as well.</p>



<p>While you may wish to avoid confrontation, in some cases, it&#8217;s unavoidable. So, what would be the best way to ask your roommate to start cleaning up after themselves?</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Looking for a roommate? Here are some qualities to look for!</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Communicate your distress</h3>



<p>When living with a messy roommate, it&#8217;s easy to assume they’re just lazy. However, it&#8217;s best to give them a chance to explain themselves and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/got-messy-roommate-here-s-how-confront-them-528808" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">have a conversation about it</a>. When living with another person, communication is key. There may be several reasons why your roommate can&#8217;t clean up after themselves; perhaps, they just lost their job or dealing with a difficult work situation, or it’s just how they are.</p>



<p>The best way of dealing with a messy roommate is to communicate your distress. Instead of hurling accusations at them, try to frame the problem as something that you need to tackle together. Pointing out your roommate’s flaws may be tempting, but it will only make them defensive and unwilling to listen to your suggestions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pick your battles</h3>



<p>Having honest conversations is important, but it&#8217;s just as crucial to know when to pick your battles. Arguing over every dirty dish, or crumb on the floor isn&#8217;t going to be productive. Cribbing over minor issues will probably lead to your roommate not wanting to listen to you, even when things are their fault.</p>



<p>If your roommate’s laziness is affecting common living spaces, that’s when you should try to convey your unhappiness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Think of your apartment in zones</h3>



<p>When dealing with a messy roommate, you need to accept that your home won&#8217;t be as neat and perfect as you want it to be. If you want everything to be your way, you’re likely to be disappointed. The best way to approach living with a lazy roommate is to think of your apartment in three zones: your space, your roommate’s space, and common spaces.</p>



<p>You have complete control over your space, such as your bedroom, and can keep it as tidy as you like. Similarly, your roommate has the right to keep their roommate the way they like it, although it may not be up to your standards.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Create a chore list or chart</h3>



<p>Although you may assume that your roommate understands their chores without needing to verbalize them, you may be wrong. Creating a chore list or chart helps keep track of what you both need to get done. It also helps that you have a visual reminder of the tasks that you need to do around the house to avoid forgetting or leaving it for the next day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Source: <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-washing-fork-hQOHDAibf6A" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></p>



<p>Sit down with your roommate and try to split the chores according to what you like and what they like. For example, you can wash the dishes then your roommate will wipe them and put them back on the shelf. As much as possible, try to divide chores evenly; you don’t want to get stuck doing all the work yourself!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Try cleaning and organizing together</h3>



<p>If all else fails, why not suggest cleaning and organizing together? Perhaps your roommate prefers group activities or could do with some tips on how to organize themselves better. Cleaning together can be a great way to spend time with your roommates and bond with them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Lead by example</h3>



<p>If you see that your roommate tends to leave a mess in the apartment, try leading by example. Clean up after yourself when eating or after using the kitchen or living room, show your roommate what should be done when it comes to cleaning. This way, your roommate can see how you clean and maybe take it as a sign that they should start cleaning too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Get the help of professional cleaners</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s say everyone in the apartment works a lot and don&#8217;t really have enough time to rigorously clean, there are some professional cleaners you can hire as long as you have the budget for it. This option is a bit more costly, but you can split the costs between roommates and in turn, you&#8217;ll have a clean apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. If it&#8217;s beyond fixing, it&#8217;s time to leave</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ve confronted your roommate, created a chore chart, tried cleaning together, and hired professional cleaners, and your roommate still leaves a mess? Maybe it&#8217;s time for you to go. You have to consider that there are extreme cases where your roommate just doesn&#8217;t know how to clean up after themselves, or maybe they&#8217;re going through a hard time that makes it difficult for them to clean. In this case, moving out is the best option, although it isn&#8217;t the easiest, it would be better for you to just leave the apartment and find a better place or roommate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding the perfect roommate and apartment</h2>



<p>Although it can be difficult, living with a messy roommate isn&#8217;t impossible. With these handy tips, you&#8217;ll know how to approach the issue without turning it into another argument. To resolve the issue peacefully, try to approach the situation calmly and allow your roommates to explain themselves. Moreover, if you think the situation is beyond fixing, maybe it&#8217;s best to just leave.</p>
