<p>There’s something about art that inspires the soul. Fortunate are those who are able to express themselves through art and design. If you’re someone who’s got a knack for designing and want to make a career out of it, lookout for art schools in NYC. Roomi has curated a list of the best art schools in New York, based on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QS ranking 2021</a>. Moreover, QS rankings are internationally recognized and thereby attract a great deal of interest and scrutiny each year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On what basis does QS rank art schools in NYC?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/AnimationOnFOX-fox-foxtv-bobs-burgers-x3UKPdnJTosBITVycx"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/x3UKPdnJTosBITVycx/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animation Domination Fox GIF by AniDom - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>In fact, QS uses a number of academic indicators by which to measure institutions, depending on the specific ranking in question. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Academic Reputation</strong> – A score based on the reputation of an institution.</li><li><strong>H Index</strong> – An index that attempts to measure both the productivity and impact of the published work of a scientist or scholar.</li><li><strong>Citations per Faculty</strong> – Citations, evaluated in some fashion to take into account the size of institution, are the best understood and most widely accepted measure of research strength.</li><li><strong>Staff with PhDs</strong> – The indicator is based on a simple proportion of each institution that hold a PhD or equivalent terminal degree.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Looks like work from home is here to stay. And no one is complaining! We all are adjusting and adapting to the new normal. Which involves looking for online jobs, whether you want to leave a toxic work place behind, or just want to switch your job. Or maybe you&#8217;re fresh out of college and want to enter the professional world. Nonetheless, we&#8217;re all somewhere on the same field. And we&#8217;re looking for legitimate stay at home jobs that pay well and allow us some peace of mind too.  So here&#8217;s a detailed guide on how to find legitimate stay at home jobs. Along with some companies that help look for the right job, such as <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">we work remotely.</a></p>



<p>Now that most of the population is desperately looking for legitimate online jobs to sustain themselves amidst a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic</a>, unfortunately, scammers have a new market to explore. So when you&#8217;re looking for stay at home jobs online, you need to be extra cautious and take certain measures to protect yourself and your career.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Things to keep in mind for stay at home jobs and offers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Email address</h3>



<p>When a legitimate employer contacts you, they&#8217;ll do so with a legitimate company ID, (<strong>x@companyname.com</strong>) So if you get an offer for stay at home jobs from a personal Gmail, Yahoo or Hotmail ID, that&#8217;s worrisome and you should not trust the job poster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Job description</h3>



<p>Another way to find out if a company is legitimate is if the stay at home job offer has a detailed job description that matches what you do for a living. If the job description is too vague. Or maybe it offers a job you&#8217;re not trained for. And they propose to train you on the job, then it&#8217;s probably a job scam.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Personal information</h3>



<p>A surefire way to spot a job scam is when a potential employer asks for your personal information such as your social security number, your bank details etc. during, or right after the interview even before they hire you. Just make sure you never give out personal details on an interview call for stay at home jobs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Application fee</h3>



<p>This is probably one of the most obvious ones. But sadly, people who really need a job, and are not well versed with how the online world works, can get trapped into an employment scam like this. A company will ask for a nominal fee so they can interview you, or hire you. THIS IS THE REDDEST FLAG YOU WILL EVER SEE. No job can require you to pay so you can get hired. No matter what they say, do not ever pay a company to hire you. It always works the other way around.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How should you find legitimate stay at home jobs?</h2>



<p>When looking for legitimate stay at home jobs, it&#8217;s always a good idea to find them on legitimate websites that allow <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">job seekers</a> and posters to come together and find the perfect match.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Social platforms</h3>



<p>LinkedIn is your safest bet. You can filter your search options to find stay at home jobs, and find legitimate employers and organizations easily.</p>



<p>Facebook and Instagram have also become budding job seeking and posting portals. You just need to be scrolling at the right time, and at the right place, and you never know, you might just find the perfect job.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Staying indoors for too long has made us all dream of seeking more in the outside world when we can finally be out there again. Maybe it&#8217;s a hobby or a skill you&#8217;re aiming to work on and develop. Or if you&#8217;re looking at public universities in New York state for college degrees, we definitely feel you! Although, learning a skill or picking up a hobby doesn&#8217;t come with a high cost, getting a degree does! So if you have decided to enroll yourself in college, we&#8217;re proud of you and we wish to help! Here&#8217;s all you need to know about the costs of public colleges in New York.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First thing&#8217;s first: Is public college free in New York?</h2>



<p>In brief, it&#8217;s a little complicated.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, public colleges in New York became much more accessible with the rollout of the Excelsior Scholarship program. The program proposed to cover four years of tuition. That too, without being tethered to academic performance at public universities in New York state.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/12/free-college-now-a-reality-in-these-states.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC reported</a>,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>The scholarship applies to all schools and public colleges in New York and State University of New York. The government stated that more than 940,000 middle-class families and individuals making up to $125,000 per year will qualify when the program completes its three-year phase-in in 2020. However, you should keep in mind that the program does not cover the cost of books or room and board, and other <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-you-should-know-about-living-with-roommates-in-college/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living</a> expenses.</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some of the requirements that make you eligible for the Excelsior scholarship are:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>You need to be New York state residents.</li><li>As a student, you should attend a SUNY or CUNY two- or four-year program at public universities in New York state.</li><li>You need to take 30 credits per calendar year (including January and summer sessions).</li><li>You should plan to live and work in New York following graduation. And for at least as long as the time you participate in the scholarship program.</li></ul>



<p>For a more detailed view of requirements, you can visit <a href="https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/financial-aid/types-of-financial-aid/nys-grants-scholarships-awards/the-excelsior-scholarship/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">NYC&#8217;s government website</a>.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/04/08/pf/college/new-york-free-tuition/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN reported</a>,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Those eligible will pay nothing for tuition at public colleges in New York, which costs $6,470 annually at four-year schools and about $4,350 a year at community colleges. But they will still be on the hook for the cost of fees and room and board if they live on campus. Those other expenses can add up to $14,000 a year.</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Okay, but how is it complicated?</h2>



<p>Well, like everything else, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-live-life-to-the-fullest-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the pandemic</a> has complicated all the areas of our collective lives!</p>



<p>The Excelsior program was a program that filled students with hopes for a cheaper public college education in New York. But sadly, according to the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation, which runs the state’s Excelsior Scholarship, the pandemic has caused a dramatic reduction in state revenues and, as a result, the processing of new applications has been delayed since April 2020.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what are other options for financial aid at public colleges in New York?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">FAFSA</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/heres-how-to-get-more-financial-aid-for-college-amid-the-pandemic.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">As per CNBC</a>, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, serves as the gateway to all federal money, including loans, work-study, and grants, which are the most desirable kind of assistance. For the 2021-2022 school year, the FAFSA filing season opens Oct. 1 — and, for the most part, the sooner students file, the better.</p>



<p>In addition, keep in mind that financial aid for public universities in New York state is calculated based on a family’s income from two years earlier. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Student loans</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve all seen the memes and talk in the media about student loans and the misery of it. But if your desire for education at public colleges in New York is insurmountable. And if you plan your finances and future prospects well, you can consider this as a good option. The most important first step being, to educate yourself all you can about the options available and how you can get the best value out of them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/learning/student-journey/college-and-career-planning/paying-for-college" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the NYC school government website</a>, here are some things you should keep in mind.</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Before you sign for any loan, make sure you ask questions. Find out when you or your family must start paying the money back and how much interest you will have to pay. Ask your college and career counselor at your school or a financial aid officer for help if you do not understand the loan documents.</li><li>You can also visit an&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/consumers/get-free-financial-counseling.page" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYC Financial Empowerment Center</a>&nbsp;for free 1:1 financial counseling.</li><li>A <strong>Direct Subsidized Perkins Loan</strong> is a Federal student loan that has a lower interest rate. Students do not have to start paying this loan back until after they graduate from college. However, students do have to start paying if they decide to leave school.</li><li><strong>Federal Direct Plus Loans</strong> for parents have higher interest rates than Direct Subsidized Loans for students. Additionally, the loan accrues interest right away, and a credit check is necessary to apply.</li></ul>



<p>And last but not least, here&#8217;s a <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">helpful government website</a> to know your options for public colleges in New York. All you have to do is go to the webpage and type your desired college or field of study. It will give you details on the colleges and public universities in New York state to help you decide which one&#8217;s the right fit for you!</p>



<p>Good luck.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are freelance jobs</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple, freelance writing is the practice of writing for money. Importantly, working on one&#8217;s own and not being employed by a company or organization forms as a core aspect of freelance jobs. Freelance writers produce written content to suit the needs of their clients, either working from home or in a rented office space.</p>



<p>The advantage of having flexibility and a range of clients to work for, makes freelance job interesting. Writers can have many different clients, or, one very large client with a lot of steady, ongoing work. In freelance writing jobs, you can work as a generalist and cover topics as diverse as lifestyle or personal finance. Or, you can specialize in one specific area, such as cryptocurrency or architectural design.</p>

For instance, blockchain, software development, supply chain management, and AI.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Financial Writing: One of the highest paying freelance jobs</h3>

While it&#8217;s not a new niche, it&#8217;s still an important industry since finance and money-saving tips can change as the markets evolve.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Think of your brain like an old Windows desktop (probably the first system that introduced you to the beautiful world of the internet.) Now think about how you thought of multitasking and opened a couple of tabs, only to stare at that buffering circle on your screen. Even though preemptive multitasking was one of the core features of Microsoft (more on that later.)</p>



<p>And arguably, it still happens to most of us. However advanced our computers might get, when we open a plethora of tabs on our browser, we face the inevitable buffer.</p>



<p>Exception: David Roberts from Vox who opened <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/1/8695555/browser-tabs" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">277 tabs on his browser</a> without any difficulty using some nerdy browser hacks!</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the catch. Computers were built by looking at the neural networks of our brain. So there&#8217;s bound to be similarities. And unfortunately, the computers we&#8217;ve built have long surpassed our meagre human brain abilities. This means our brains need to put even more effort when we want to practice multitasking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What happens in the brain when we&#8217;re multitasking</h2>



<p>Even advanced high-tech computers slow down when they&#8217;re multitasking in the form of 10s of 100s of open browsers. So what do you think happens in our brain when we try and open multiple tabs &#8211; to carry out many tasks all at the same time?</p>



<p>Think how when you&#8217;re cooking and someone&#8217;s talking in your ear, physically or through the phone. It increases the risk of messing things up, even if you&#8217;re a pro at cooking or talking on the phone.</p>



<p>Or think about when you&#8217;re working and your favorite song comes on. You feel the urge to sing along. And even though listening and singing along is enjoyable to us, it becomes a task for the brain. And inevitably, your other task &#8211; work takes a hit.</p>



<p>To find the science behind this fascinating process of multitasking and what happens in the brain, Eyal Ophir and his colleagues at Stanford wanted to find out <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/august24/multitask-research-study-082409.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what happens in the brain of multitaskers</a> &#8211; or people who swear by multitasking.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s what the researchers found</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>They (the multitaskers) couldn&#8217;t help thinking about the task they weren&#8217;t doing. The high multitaskers are always drawing from all the information in front of them. They can&#8217;t keep things separate in their minds.</em></p><cite>Eyal Ophir, Stanford</cite></blockquote></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are multitasking skills? Do they exist?</h2>



<p>Well, it all depends on what you want out of your time. Ask yourself what you are trying to achieve by multitasking.</p>



<p>Say you work two jobs.

Would it help if you just opened both in two separate tabs and worked on them simultaneously? For obvious reasons, both tasks would clash with each other when you navigate through. And switching tabs on a whim is just not an option.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can we practice it at all, then?</h3>



<p>If you do have to put multitasking skills into place &#8211; still taking the example of two jobs, you need to be smart about it. If your brain can take only one thing at a time to be efficient and quick, you need to put your priorities in place.</p>



<p>So, focus on one particular goal, and set a timeline for it. Stay away from your distracting phone. You could even shut the music off, or put something calm that will help you stay focused. And then just carry out the said task to completion.</p>



<p><strong>Then,</strong> move on to the other task after a short break.</p>



<p>That is simply your best chance at multitasking, however many tasks you want to finish.</p>



<p>If you focus on efficiency on one task at a time, to your surprise, you&#8217;ll find you have more and more time if you shoo the distractions away!</p>



<p>And that is what pre emptive multitasking is too &#8211; in computers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is preemptive multitasking? What can we learn from that?</h2>



<p><strong><em>In technical terms, preemptive multitasking is when a computer operating system uses some criteria to decide how long to allocate to any one task before giving another task a turn to use the operating system.</em></strong></p>



<p>So basically, do just that. Use the software (brain) that you have with as much efficiency as you can, by understanding it better and giving it what it needs, so it can give you what you need.</p>



<p>To put it simply, allocate time to one task, before giving another task a go.</p>



<p>So no matter what tasks you&#8217;re trying to complete, divide your day into the tasks you want to finish and how long each task might take. In the way of preemptive multitasking, start one thing and take it to completion, without switching to other things. And before you know it, you&#8217;ll have shut your desktop and have plenty of time to unwind after work, every day!</p>

<p>Are you stuck in a career that you detest? Perhaps in a job that makes you doubt yourself? Maybe you catch yourself daydreaming about the life you envisioned yourself living when you were a student. Or maybe you&#8217;re just exhausted with the corporate rut of rinse and repeat. What you truly seek is a purpose and a life full of adventure. You want to grow professionally and seize opportunities. But you&#8217;re <em>not sure if you have it in you.</em> Well, the good news is that you are never too old or too late to turn your dreams into reality. Especially when it comes to your career, you can always grow by setting a professional development plan for yourself. Keep reading to find out what that is!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is professional growth?</h2>



<p>Professional growth or professional development essentially refers to learning new skills that make you better in your career. It keeps you from going obsolete in an ever-evolving job market. A professional development plan lets you outline the skills you need to excel in your career, stay up-to-date with trends, and carve an individualistic presence for yourself in your industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s been a while that most of us have been lucky enough to be working in our PJs from home. And safe to assume, we&#8217;ve come to love this temporary shift of our day job into online jobs. While some of us might be desperately waiting for our social gatherings to go back to normal, one thing most of us are dreading now is the normal work world could resume any day, putting an end to the era of work from home jobs. And before we know it, it will demand our presence in the offices for a major chunk of our time in the day. Therefore, our only plausible escape remains to Google &#8216;freelance jobs for beginners&#8217; or &#8216;freelance jobs for students&#8217; wondering if we can make it a full-time career.</p>



<p>So is it possible to continue working from home, even after the pandemic is over? Maybe you&#8217;ve been going to work all along, even amidst a pandemic on the rise. Or maybe you were let go because of the pandemic and had no other choice but to find online jobs to pay the bills (and have now come to love it.)</p>



<p>Whatever your reason, you&#8217;re here for an answer. So let&#8217;s deep dive into the possibilities, as well as the pros and the cons of becoming a (full-time) freelancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-anyone-become-a-freelancer">Can anyone become a freelancer?</h2>



<p>That surely depends on the kind of work you do for a living. Additionally, the conditions of being a freelancer would also vary with the kind of occupation you do. With the internet boom and most work requiring just a laptop and a stable internet connection, it is quite possible to find online jobs across all fields.</p>



<p>However, if your work requires physical presence, you can still look at becoming a freelancer. If not for finding work-from-home jobs, it can allow you the possibility of setting your own hours in the least.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-pros-of-working-from-home">What are the pros of working from home? </h2>



<p>Excited? Let&#8217;s look at a few pros of becoming a freelancer. We will also tell you about how to look for freelance jobs for beginners. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-have-the-freedom-to-make-your-own-schedule">You have the freedom to make your own schedule</h3>



<p>The number one reason for hating your regular 9-5 could be well.. the 9 &#8211; 5. You have to clock in at a certain time. You can&#8217;t leave before a certain time. And you have to deal with all the drama that ensues in between.</p>



<p>But when you&#8217;re a freelancer with work from home jobs, you aren&#8217;t as time-bound as you are at a regular job. No one can demand you to clock in or clock out. And all you need to keep in mind is submission of your work within the deadlines.</p>



<p>But stay wary though. You either have to have super organizational skills and be a self-motivator or have to be willing to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn those skills</a> to make it as a freelancer. Otherwise, you&#8217;d end up working online jobs ALL DAY LONG. And being in your PJs wouldn&#8217;t help even a tad bit.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-will-have-to-look-for-online-jobs">You will have to look for online jobs</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s not easy. But thanks to the pandemic (can&#8217;t believe we can actually write that), <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are a lot more online jobs</a> than before. So becoming a freelancer or looking for work from home jobs can give you better results now, owing to the increased numbers of such online jobs.</p>



<p>But that said, you still have to put in a lot of effort to find a good job that pays well and doesn&#8217;t exploit your time or energy. Especially if you&#8217;re looking at freelance jobs for beginners. And oftentimes, you have to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/do-this-while-you-wait-to-hear-from-a-job-interview-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">wait for a long time to hear back</a> from a potential job.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-and-how-exactly-do-you-find-a-job-online">And how exactly do you find a job online?</h4>



<p>There are several basic ways to look for online jobs, but you&#8217;d have to do it all simultaneously to increase your chances of finding a good fit.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trusted-job-portals">Trusted job portals</h5>



<p>Spruce up your resume and stay active on portals such as LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Upwork</a>, Fiverr, etc. Make a kickass portfolio and keep it ready to send through when you get in touch with a potential client.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-media-websites-and-groups">Social media websites and groups</h5>



<p>A lot of employers are looking for people on social media &#8211; especially for marketing-related roles. So join some groups that post online jobs. You will find plenty work from home jobs, freelance jobs for students, and freelance jobs for beginners on such groups. The next step is to stay active in these groups.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tap-into-your-network">Tap into your network </h5>



<p>If you know people who work in the HR department, consider getting in touch with them for potential work from home jobs. Connect with previous colleagues and ask around if they personally know any freelancers or people looking for freelancers. Knowing freelancers will help you enter this world and find online jobs for yourself!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-are-there-any-downsides-to-being-a-full-time-freelancer">So are there any downsides to being a full-time freelancer?</h2>



<p>Now before you&#8217;re determined to find your dream online jobs, let&#8217;s look at a few downsides that you need to be aware of. However tempting it may seem, the truth is, that it&#8217;s not for everyone.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beware-of-scams-when-looking-for-online-jobs">Beware of scams when looking for online jobs</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, with an increase in demand for online jobs, a bigger scam employment market has crept up online. So you have to be extra careful when looking for work from home jobs and freelance jobs for students. Stay wary of all red flags so you don&#8217;t become a victim in these troubling times. Especially if you&#8217;re on the lookout for freelance jobs for beginners.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understand-the-process-of-making-money-in-online-jobs">Understand the process of making money in online jobs</h3>



<p>Firstly, your payments will be irregular, depending on the type of clients, and how many of those you have. Many freelancers find managing administrative tasks difficult. One such task is generating and sending invoices for completed work. Thankfully, there are tools available to streamline this process, such as <a href="https://www.invoicesimple.com/invoice-template/excel-invoice-template" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">invoice templates for Excel</a>. These templates can simplify billing and payments, allowing freelancers to focus more on their core activities rather than manual calculations.</p>



<p>Secondly, you will be responsible for your own payments when working online jobs. You&#8217;ll be sending invoices and following up with the client in case of delay &#8211; as opposed to a regular paycheck at the same time every month at a regular job. And one thing all freelancers dread &#8211; you&#8217;d also have to learn to do your own taxes!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-accept-the-job-insecurity-that-comes-with-it">Accept the job insecurity that comes with it</h3>



<p>Because of a lack of personal relationship with your client and lack of accountability, you have less job security when you&#8217;re freelancing. And it can be rather erratic to find and sustain online jobs and freelance jobs for students.</p>



<p>In conclusion, becoming a freelancer comes with its risks. But if you&#8217;re determined to become a successful freelancer, you shall become one!</p>



<p>Good luck to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living in New York City can be an exhilarating and rewarding experience, but it can also come with a hefty price tag. Whether you&#8217;re a student, a young professional, or just looking to supplement your income, finding ways to make extra money in NYC can feel like a daunting task. But, there are plenty of opportunities waiting for you in the city that never sleeps.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore eight different ways you can make some extra cash by working part-time. From freelance gigs to sharing economy platforms, these options are sure to get you excited about the possibilities of earning more in the Big Apple. So let&#8217;s dive in and explore the many ways you can fatten your wallet and make the most of your time in NYC!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-extra-ways-to-make-money-in-nyc">8 Extra Ways to Make Money in NYC</h2>



<p>Especially if you’re starting by yourself professionally and don’t have much to fall back on, the financial stress is real! You’ve got to find that side hustle! Check out these part-time jobs in New York to make some extra cash.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-drive-for-uber-or-taskrabbit"><strong>1. Drive for Uber or TaskRabbit</strong></h3>



<p>If you don’t mind driving around NYC – given the crowded streets and rush-hour madness – you can consider driving people or goods across the city. It works best if you have a car, but you can rent one too.</p>



<p>If you’re sure that moody customers can’t get through your bubble of Zen, you’ll make a great Uber or Lyft driver, picking a schedule you&#8217;re okay with. You can also deliver groceries or packages through FreshDirect or TaskRabbit.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what else you can do:</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Deliver food for UberEats, GrubHub, Doordash, Eat24, etc.</li>



<li>Deliver clothes for ByNext.</li>



<li>Deliver packages with Amazon Flex.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<p>New York has enough customers for all these services to have constant delivery needs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-pet-sit-or-walk-dogs"><strong>2. Pet-sit or walk dogs</strong></h3>



<p>If you like pets, this is a great part-time job for you! There are many New Yorkers who have beloved dogs, but no time to take them for walks. Some dog owners pay good money for someone knowledgeable about dogs to take their pet for a walk and make sure it gets exercise and playtime.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on the owner’s cat, dog, or bird (and let’s hope it’s nothing more dangerous), feed them, give them their meds, etc. Find your side gig on pet-sitting websites like Pet Sitters International or Pet Sitting NYC.</p>

<p>Create a website portfolio, however basic, so prospective hirers can understand what you do. Most work will be simple, but the core team just won’t have enough time or enough expertise to make a good job out of it.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can find other freelancing jobs to do remotely for people from across the country. For both kinds of gigs, keep checking career websites like&nbsp;LinkedIn or Indeed.</p>

<p>This is a great side gig for that extra cash if you&#8217;re good at cooking and enjoy the task. The busy lifestyle of New Yorkers doesn&#8217;t allow time to cook for themselves. However, most residents are highly concerned about their health and are eager to improve it.</p>



<p>Sign up on websites that act as a platform between people looking for food and people who cook. Depending on your schedule and the client’s needs, you can decide what meals you can cook for them.</p>

<p>So, if you can coach someone for activities like home workouts and running in the parks, this is a good time for you. Sign up on platforms like&nbsp;CoachUp&nbsp;where you can meet clients and like-minded coaches.</p>

<p>So, make sure that before your first babysitting job, do some research on your own and talk to the parents about the child you&#8217;re babysitting. It&#8217;s better to be prepared!</p>
