										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 was the year we all learned to live with the “new normal”. We weren’t happy about it, but we got on with things to protect each other. It was a year full of surprises and uncertainties, with industries like travel and real estate taking a knock bigger than any other we can remember. Rent reports said that homeowners, landlords, and tenants all over the world were forced into uncomfortable situations. And at multiple points throughout the year, moving house seemed impossible, with rent prices on a predicted increase. This is why Roomi’s 2020 Year in Review is so interesting. </p>



<p>We took a look at some key data collected over the year of unprecedented times, to uncover how COVID-19 impacted the room rental market in the United States.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There was more urgency amongst people moving to a new city</h2>



<p>There was a lot more moving and shifting between cities in 2020, compared to previous years. It seems like the pandemic is the underlying reason for this, with previous research finding that many renters were either forced out of their homes due to job loss, etc. and many chose to leave more expensive cities in search of somewhere more affordable to work remotely from.</p>



<p>Roomi’s users in particular were in a hurry to either find a roommate or a new place to live. Repeat purchases were up 18% compared to 2018, and a much higher percentage of users on the app actually made a purchase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rent prices continued to decrease steadily</h2>



<p>As reported in our<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-december-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> December room rental report</a>, the price to rent a room decreased throughout the year &#8211; which could be as a result of landlords dropping rent in order to keep rooms filled, instead of empty.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tech migration</h2>



<p>In 2020, Roomi also experienced what has been called “The Great Tech Migration”. People were migrating throughout the country. And all patterns were different to pre-pandemic activity. We witnessed a clear desire to move out into the suburbs. This was noted as people moved from major cities and tech hubs. </p>



<p>It seemed that cities that were bustling at just the start of the year 2020 (such as San Francisco and New York City) experienced more out-migration. And places such as Madison and Cleveland gained the most movers. How temporary or permanent these measures are, we don’t know just yet.</p>



<p>For now, it seems that places like NYC lost their appeal in many ways. It went from a bustling tech hub, with fantastic nightlife, culture, opportunities, and prime shopping streets. To a place that felt empty. For that reason, many people moved to the suburbs. To live with their parents or find cheaper rent. Since they could now work remotely and no longer had to worry about being close to their workplace.</p>

<p>It’s the end of the year and all we can say is honestly wtf was that? Alright &#8211; that’s not all we can say. We’ve also been doing some digging into Roomi’s exclusive database to find out what the US rental market looked like in December 2020. In other words, how much does it cost (on average) to rent a single room this month?</p>



<p>Before you check the stats for yourself, don’t forget to see our <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-november-2020/">rent report for rooms in November</a>, so you can compare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All that’s left to say is that we can’t wait to see what 2021 will bring for the Roomi community. What cities are you hoping to explore next year?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In general, rooms got cheaper in December</h2>



<p>Of course, this isn’t the case for every US city, but we are seeing a great deal of major rent drops when compared to November’s data.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Most noticeable is Chicago, where rent dropped from $1104 to $687</li><li>Miami rent was reduced from $951 to $844</li><li>Philadelphia rent went from $860 per month, to $566</li><li>Dallas rent went down from $743 to $615</li></ul>



<p>While some rent drops are subtle, others are quite dramatic, particularly in Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Diego (which we’ll get to later on). But with the U.S. currently in the midst of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/upshot/home-prices-explaining-frenzy.html" class="broken_link">a frenzy in the housing market</a>”, does it make sense that rooms are getting cheaper?</p>



<p>Potentially, yes. Following the housing market’s freeze in spring, it then underwent a frenzy of home buying. Mortgage prices are lower and this is encouraging more buyers &#8211; both first time and repeat. It seems that the pandemic has prompted many renters to make the leap into buying, which could mean that more rooms are available in shared homes.</p>



<p>Therefore, landlords all across the states could be putting prices down to make sure rooms are full in time for Christmas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Atlanta makes its debut to the chart, coming in at #7</h2>



<p>The cost to rent a room in Atlanta hasn’t got the city into the top 10 in the U.S. for the last few months, but this month, the Georgian spot makes it onto our list. Atlanta has always had a reputation for affordability (in general), despite it being home to multiple Fortune 500 headquarters and being one of the wealthiest cities in the U.S.</p>



<p>However, evidence does show that rental prices in Atlanta are creeping up, and <a href="https://atlanta.curbed.com/2019/1/22/18192996/atlanta-rent-prices-realpage-luxury-apartment-report">outpaced most of the country in 2018</a> with rent prices rising 4.8% over 12 months. And, the price increases in Atlanta throughout 2021 are expected to continue to be amongst the largest in the nation.<br>A <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/winter-may-be-the-best-time-to-rent-an-apartment.html">RentHop study</a> broke this down into a monthly scale. They found that winter is the best time to rent an apartment, with December offering the cheapest prices in Atlanta. The price to rent an entire apartment in December is around $1300, with landlords more likely to offer discounts during winter due to lower demand. This does, of course, contrast with our findings when it comes to renting individual rooms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">San Diego gets knocked off the top 10&nbsp;</h2>



<p>San Diego was the 6th most expensive city in which to rent a room in November, but in December, it doesn’t make the top 10. Could this have anything to do with the <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/story/2020-12-03/new-regulations-slashing-san-diego-short-term-rentals-by-50-percent-endorsed-by-planning-commission">new regulations </a>enforced by the city’s Planning Commission, that would slash the number of Airbnb-style, short-term rentals in half?</p>



<p>Up until this, the city had been struggling to regulate vacation rentals. Of course, many homeowners in San Diego relied on this income; there’s a possibility that some landlords are switching to taking in longer-term tenants than before to supplement the income missing from short-term rentals. With all this extra space in their homes, some may be slashing the cost to rent a single room.</p>

<p>As we make the shift into the final month of the year, we thought it was about time we took a look at Roomi’s Rent Report. We’re lucky here at Roomi because we get to share this exclusive information with our community. This report entails the cost of single rooms instead of entire apartments!

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. According to the Roomi room report: San Francisco secures the top spot</h3>



<p><strong>Roomi fact: </strong><mark>If you’d been looking for a room in September or October, you’d have spent the most money by settling in New York City.</mark></p>



<p>This month, however, San Francisco takes back its title as the most expensive city to live in the United States.</p>



<p>But what is it that consistently drives the cost of SF living upwards? Well, the obvious reason is the area’s booming tech industry and proximity to Silicon Valley. San Francisco has the 3rd highest number of billionaires in the country, and the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-expensive-is-san-francisco-mind-blowing-facts-2019-5?r=US&amp;IR=T#1-the-bay-area-is-home-to-more-wealthy-people-than-any-other-of-the-most-populous-us-metro-areas-according-to-the-us-census-1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">median household income</a> is 74% higher than the overall country’s median.</p>



<p>If you still want to live in USA’s most high-end cities, you could consider some affordable neighborhoods. Bayview is one of the city’s cheapest neighborhoods, as well as Haight-Ashbury, Lone Mountain and Outer Sunset. That means that even if you’re a student, are new to the city, or make a limited income, you can still get close to the action around the bay area.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. The state of California continues to rise in cost</h3>



<p>In addition to San Francisco, the cost to rent a room in San Diego and Los Angeles has also risen this month. San Diego has gone from an average of $925/month in October to $1030/month in November, and LA has experienced a more subtle jump, going from $1181 to $1212.</p>



<p>When it comes to apartments in LA, the opposite appears to be true. According to an <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-11-23/rent-falling-los-angeles-rising-suburbs-inland-empire" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">article from the LA Times</a>, the estimated rent for an apartment in LA County has decreased 5.3% since the start of the year. </p>



<p>One potential reason for the increase in the cost of single rooms could be that individuals are starting to flock back to big cities. When coronavirus first began spreading, it had our jobs, health and sense of safety in its claws. Naturally, professionals that were able to work remotely left the more expensive cities to pursue cheaper rent elsewhere. The fact that California room rates are rising this month suggests the 3 Californian cities in our research are once again looking more attractive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Generous concessions are driving Gen-Z to re-enter the rental market</h3>



<p>Perhaps the most prominent trend noted in this rent report in the US.  Alongside the strong desire for many to return back to normal, generous concessions are also to thank for Generation Z’s dramatic entry back into the rental market. Whereas earlier on in the year, many chose to move back in with their parents. However, now benefits such as rent breaks, free parking, and reduced security deposits are luring them back.<br>A Zillow survey found that as many as <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.globest.com/2020/11/19/generous-concessions-drive-gen-z-back-to-the-rental-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">49% of Gen Z renters</a> had chosen to leave home and start renting again due to these concessions. It’s estimated that the price breaks meant renters could save the equivalent of two months of rent, in Boston, Chicago, Indianapolis, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.<br><br>That&#8217;s all in our Roomi rent report, for now, stay tuned for a monthly analysis!<br><br><strong>D’you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find average room prices via our exclusive Roomi Rent Report?

<p>It’s that time of the month where we at Roomi sift through the data we have at our fingertips. Just so we can keep you updated on what’s happening in the USA’s rental market. We like a close eye on the price of renting a room in some major cities. So we decided to check out how much you can expect to rent a room for in October 2020. Here&#8217;s Roomi&#8217;s Rent Report covering the average room prices in October 2020, in the US.</p>



<p>For comparison purposes, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-september-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can also see <strong>the average room rates in September 2020.</strong></a></p>



<p>Interestingly, when <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.fortunebuilders.com/top-10-u-s-cities-with-the-highest-rents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">renting an entire one-bedroom apartment</a>, you can expect to spend the most if you’re basing yourself in San Francisco. This is followed by New York City and then Boston. When you’re searching for a single room alone though, New York City comes in top &#8211; then LA, then San Fran.</p>

<p>Take a look at the average room prices in 10 U.S. cities in October below.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why did Miami suddenly get more affordable?</h2>



<p>When we studied rent prices in October compared to September was that Miami was suddenly looking <em>way </em>more attractive, cost-wise. A room in The Magic City (nicknamed because of its rapid growth in population between 1930 and 1940, has gone from an average of $1190 to $922 per month. That’s a decrease of $268 to rent a room there.</p>



<p>But why? Well, like just about everything else this year, coronavirus may be to blame. Interestingly, Miami room rates in August were similar to now, but September saw a huge surge in rent. It seems that, despite Miami being a COVID hotspot, the rental market exploded towards the middle of this year. Despite the high number of cases, <a href="https://miamiagentmagazine.com/2020/07/13/post-lockdown-migration-driving-miamis-rental-market/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">people are continuing to migrate to Miami</a>, and the Miami-Dade County Mayor decided to shut down all shut-term rentals. Just one explanation for single room prices to shoot up in September, then level out this month, maybe?</p>



<p>Keep in mind that the geographical spread of Miami means there tends to be huge variation amongst different neighborhoods. South Beach and Coconut Grove, for example, skew the results upward, whereas Overtown and Liberty City could offer much more affordable living.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does the Rent Report say about the general upward trend across the country?</h2>



<p>Apart from Miami (the anomaly this month), there’s a general increase in the price to rent a room across most cities listed here. This is interesting, because the price to rent an entire apartment is actually dropping for some of the states’ most expensive cities.</p>



<p>Could that mean that more Americans are seeing the benefits of short-term rentals and that, in turn, is pushing up costs? In these uncertain times, it’s natural for people to be reluctant to lock themselves into long-term contracts. Many people are losing jobs and having to relocate, and being tied to a place for 6 or 12-months isn’t always favorable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Renting a single room gives people more flexibility and less commitment, and as many single rooms are often part of a bigger furnished place, there are fewer expenses to make the place liveable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The big question on everyone’s lips (well, on our lips at least) is how did the rental market change due to coronavirus? At Roomi, we don’t focus on the entire rental market (full apartments, houses, condos, etc.) but on single rooms. We decided that the best way to figure out what the impact of coronavirus has been on real estate in the United States is by studying our own exclusive data.</p>



<p>So, we gathered some key Roomi facts from March 2020, and compared them to September 2020.</p>



<p>And guess what, guys? The outcome wasn’t as grim as so many predicted early on in the year! In fact, people are branching out and finding new roomis now more than ever! So, whether you’re <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-hunting-in-la-part-1-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">renting in Los Angeles</a>, Boston or NYC, you can count on Roomi to have fresh listings from people all across the states who are ready to become your next roommate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How did the change in rental market impact Roomi? </h2>



<p>Well, for starters, Roomi had 9600 new registered users in March, and 18,900 sign-ups in September. The short-term rental sector first blossomed following the last recession, with more people appreciating the value that a sharing economy could offer &#8211; especially in uncertain times when many are reluctant to take on a long-term lease or unable to buy their own property. So, there has certainly been a change in the rental market in this regard.</p>



<p>Coronavirus doesn’t seem to have negatively impacted the short-term market; in fact, it’s only spurred it on. When the pandemic first began taking over our lives, 9600 individuals signed up for a Roomi account. In fact, 18,900 people signed up to our platform in September when COVID-19 was in full swing. </p>



<p>Becoming more mainstream by the likes of Airbnb and Roomi, it seems that short-term rentals are here to stay. As more young people are changing the way they travel, work and live, they’re signing up to platforms such as ours to enjoy that flexibility they want &#8211; and need, especially in times like these. The long-term impact of coronavirus on real estate is still revealing itself.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/jdEMZDHtKNBpFAv1ud" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/jdEMZDHtKNBpFAv1ud/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There were 28,300 active listings on Roomi in March, compared to 88,900 in September.</h2>



<p>Fewer people were travelling at the start of the pandemic because of the obvious risk factor. People were reluctant to move &#8211; and who could blame them? </p>



<p>However, it seems that as time has gone on, many of us have learned to live with the pandemic. Aside from those in high-risk groups, we’re noticing many people trying to live their lives as normally as possible. For many, that means having to share their homes with strangers, as living alone is unaffordable. So while there has been a noticeable change in the rental market, people have learnt to cope with it.</p>



<p>We saw a surge of new Roomi listings in September, compared to earlier on in the year. It’s likely that as many people move back in with their family, or partners, lots of rooms are opening up around the states, and landlords and leaseholders just can’t afford to keep them open while we wait for the end of COVID.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There were a total of 550,000 profile views in March, with 1,500,000 in September, and 17,400 unique users submitted a rental request in March, compared to 29,000 in September.</h2>



<p>The good news is Americans are taking action to find their perfect room or roommate match. In February, before coronavirus hit, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/coronavirus-pandemic-cuts-rent-growth-to-a-decade-low.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rent growth for single-family homes</a> had hit its highest pace in four years. Just three months later, it was at its lowest growth rate in a decade. So, the impact of coronavirus on real estate has been massive. This slowdown in rent growth was most dramatic for higher-end rentals. As you can see, the demand for more expensive properties has clearly dropped. So, there has clearly been quite a bit of change in the rental market.</p>



<p>The demand for single room rentals, on the other hand, hasn’t been impacted in the same way. One million extra profile views were made in September compared to March, with rental requests jumping from 17,400 to 29,000 in that period. </p>

<p>It was interesting to see the impact that coronavirus had on rent prices in the U.S. We at Roomi have been keeping a close eye on the data we have at our disposal. Contrary to many predictions, we came to realize that the virus <em>did not </em>deter most people from living with near-strangers. To our surprise, it turns out that, renting a room instead of an entire apartment was preferable. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/guide-to-renting-cheap-apartments-in-new-york-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">This was due to the many money-saving possibilities.</a> Roomi&#8217;s rent report seeks to determine rental patterns w.r.t. room prices and demographics.</p>



<p>When you’re trying to decide between living with roommates vs. living alone, the cost of living has no doubt come into the equation. Of course, the average cost of renting a room varies pretty substantially between U.S. cities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Check out this graph that shows Roomi’s exclusive data. This is based on the average cost to rent a room in these top 10 cities in the United States.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why has San Francisco dropped to #3?</h2>



<p>When compiling this rent report, we noticed a considerable shuffling in city positions between August and September. With the standout comparison being San Francisco. In August, SF had the most expensive room prices, with an average rent price of $1597 on average. In September, this dropped to $1143 and the city was overtaken in cost by both NYC and Miami.</p>



<p>But why? San Francisco has seen a steady drop in rent prices this year. For instance, in July, the average room prices were as high as $1615. Historically, rent prices in San Fran have only gone up, and this plummet has been a real shock for both renters and landlords. The drop could be a result of what <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/slideshow/San-Francisco-rental-prices-fall-june-11-percent-204756.php" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Zumper calls “pandemic pricing</a>”. With major companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Square rolling out permanent work-from-home policies, people could be choosing to leave the Bay area to work remotely in more affordable spots.</p>



<p>Rising unemployment levels in the area could also be a factor &#8211; many landlords are having to adjust their asking price to get rooms filled, or offering temporary rent reduction to tenants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The growth of Philadelphia’s rental market</h2>



<p>The average monthly price of a room in Philly has dropped from $909 in August to $663 in September. But it seems that this decrease is an anomaly for the city during the past year or two and largely, Philadelphia has been one to watch for rent increases.</p>



<p>Perhaps the decline is another case of pandemic pricing, but if we look at the trends before COVID-19 hit, we’re noticing that some of Philadelphia’s most desirable neighborhoods were only on the up. Forbes has actually pinpointed the area as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ingowinzer/2020/06/04/the-best-markets-for-real-estate-investment-during-the-coronovirus/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the markets most likely to return to good growth</a>.</p>



<p>A potential reason for the growth could be the fact that Philadelphia has some of the most affordable houses to buy; it has an affordability index of 1 out of 10. With 10 being the least affordable. More people are choosing to buy places in the area and rent them out for a profit. On top of that, the quality of life in Philadelphia is undoubtedly a good one; it’s been consistently rated as one of the <a href="https://selectgreaterphl.com/quality-of-life/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">best places to visit in the U.S.</a>, and by the looks of things, many of those tourists decide to stick around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A rising population, increasing job opportunities, and low cost of living all come together to make Philadelphia a market to watch.</p>
