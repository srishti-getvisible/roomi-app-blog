<p>We do our best to make sure that only real people with an actual room for rent can list a room on Roomi. Most listers on Roomi verify their account by providing a copy of their lease, utility bill or government issued ID. You will see certain badges on a user&#8217;s listing to see what forms of verification they have provided.</p>



<p>Our Security and Safety Team also requires address verification from the room lister.</p>



<p>Remember to never send or transfer a check or money without a lease and seeing the room.</p>
