<p>Many renters dream of owning a home. That desire often extends to property investment, where they can create wealth and security. Yet, significant obstacles stand in the way. High prices, lack of knowledge, and uncertainty about financing options make this transition daunting.</p>



<p>The good news is that, with careful planning and informed decisions, renters can effectively navigate these challenges. The best place to start is to understand their financial position and explore various loan types, like FHA or VA loans; they can turn their aspirations into reality.</p>



<p>Practical steps like setting budgets and researching neighborhoods are also necessary. Keep reading for valuable insights that will guide you toward becoming a successful property investor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exploring-house-hacking-as-a-strategy">Exploring House Hacking as a Strategy</h2>



<p>One effective strategy for renters to transition into property investment is house hacking, and tools like <a href="https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The QR Code generator</a> can help you advertise spare rooms attractively. This approach allows individuals to purchase and rent out part of a property, often covering the mortgage payment. </p>

By starting with house hacking, renters can gain valuable experience in managing tenants and understanding property maintenance without the entire financial burden of a traditional investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many first-time buyers find this method appealing because it offers financial benefits and practical learning opportunities. With careful planning, house hacking becomes an accessible way to start building wealth through real estate while still enjoying the comforts of homeownership.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leveraging-investment-property-loans">Leveraging Investment Property Loans</h2>



<p>Renters can also consider leveraging investment property loans as a viable strategy for transitioning to property investors. This form of financing allows renters to purchase properties, helping them build equity and create wealth over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investment property loans often come with favorable terms, making it easier to manage cash flow while generating rental income. For instance, working with lenders like Griffin Funding, an <a href="https://griffinfunding.com/traditional-mortgages/investment-property-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investment property lender</a> that offers various loan options tailored specifically for real estate investments, can be beneficial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Understanding the specific qualifications and requirements is crucial when applying for these loans because they differ from traditional home mortgages. Evaluating one’s financial situation and ensuring adequate creditworthiness will enhance the chances of securing better rates and terms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-utilizing-partnerships-for-property-investment-nbsp">Utilizing Partnerships for Property Investment&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As renters explore investment property loans, they may also find that forming partnerships can significantly ease the transition to becoming property investors. Partnering with a friend or family member allows individuals to pool resources, share responsibilities, and reduce financial risk when investing in real estate.</p>



<p>This collaborative approach opens up more opportunities, such as purchasing larger properties or covering down payments together. Investors can divide expenses like maintenance costs and management duties, making navigating the complexities of owning rental properties easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Establishing clear agreements is essential; this helps outline each partner&#8217;s role and expectations. This arrangement creates a solid foundation for successful investments while minimizing personal strain and fostering shared goals within the partnership.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-market-trends-for-smart-investments-nbsp">Understanding Market Trends for Smart Investments&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While partnerships provide a helpful strategy, renters should also focus on understanding market trends to make informed property investment decisions.

<p><a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/investment-products/real-estate-investment-trusts-reits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) </a>represent yet another effective strategy for renters to enter the property investment market. REITs allow individuals to invest in real estate without directly owning properties, making them an accessible option for those starting out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing in REITs provides diversification and potential passive income through dividends, appealing features for first-time investors. These trusts typically focus on various sectors, such as residential or commercial real estate, enabling renters to align their investments with personal interests or market trends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researching different types of REITs and their performance helps inform smart choices. Additionally, investing in publicly traded REITs is straightforward; they can be purchased through regular brokerage accounts like stocks. This method lets renters dip their toes into property investment while minimizing risk and upfront costs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-considering-short-term-rentals-for-additional-income">Considering Short-Term Rentals for Additional Income</h2>



<p>Entering the short-term rental market is also an effective strategy that allows individuals to capitalize on properties they own by renting them out temporarily, often generating higher income than traditional long-term leases.</p>



<p>Renters can start by exploring platforms like Airbnb or Vrbo, which simplify connecting with potential guests. Investing in properties located near tourist attractions or business districts can enhance occupancy rates and overall profitability.</p>



<p>Understanding local regulations regarding short-term rentals is essential, as some areas have specific rules that may affect operations. Additionally, maintaining a high standard of property management ensures positive guest experiences and repeat bookings.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maximizing-networking-opportunities-for-success">Maximizing Networking Opportunities for Success</h2>



<p>Building a strong network is crucial for renters transitioning to property investors. Engaging with other investors, real estate agents, and industry professionals opens doors to valuable insights and resources.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like attending a dinner party where each guest shares unique experiences that enrich your knowledge.</p>



<p>Renters can join local real estate investment groups or online forums, fostering connections that lead to potential partnerships or mentorships. Learning from seasoned investors helps them navigate challenges more effectively and discover hidden opportunities in the market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maximizing-tax-benefits-for-real-estate-investors-nbsp">Maximizing Tax Benefits for Real Estate Investors&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The final strategy to consider involves maximizing <a href="https://www.nahb.org/other/consumer-resources/tax-benefits-of-homeownership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tax benefits associated with real estate</a> investment. Understanding the various deductions available can significantly enhance a property investor&#8217;s bottom line. For instance, investors may deduct mortgage interest, property taxes, and certain expenses related to property management or improvements.</p>



<p>Additionally, depreciation on rental properties provides an opportunity to offset taxable income over time. This means even if the property&#8217;s value appreciates, owners can benefit from tax relief annually.</p>



<p>Engaging a knowledgeable accountant or tax advisor familiar with real estate investing helps ensure renters take full advantage of these opportunities while remaining compliant with local laws.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-summing-up">Summing Up</h2>



<p>Investing in real estate opens up a world of possibilities for renters ready to make the leap. Embracing strategies like house hacking, understanding market trends, or maximizing tax benefits empowers individuals to take control of their financial future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, every step you take toward property investment builds wealth and invaluable experience. As you explore your options and seek opportunities, trust your instincts and stay informed. The path to becoming a successful investor is just ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before you proceed, be sure to look up information specific to your city. These are steps that you&#8217;ll need to complete as a part of the rental application process in general.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-1-fill-out-your-rental-application"><strong>Step 1: Fill out your rental application.</strong></h3>



<p>A rental application is a form and a set of supporting documents. This includes some personal information about you like residence history, income, references, pets, and anything relevant to renting a property.</p>

<p>A rental application is used by landlords to screen potential tenants and decide who will be a good fit for the property. This process varies for each building or residence, some forms can be filled up online or collected from the landlord when you visit the place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 2: Submit the required documents.</strong></h3>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to submit certain documents as a part of the rental application process to help the landlord establish your identity and screen you.</p>



<p></p>



<p>To keep your documents organized on your Mac, it&#8217;s essential to manage them efficiently to avoid duplication and unnecessary clutter. When preparing your documents for submission, you may find duplicate files or unwanted trash that can hinder the process. Streamlining this process is key, and for those needing to organize large documents before submission, consider the ease of <a href="https://theonlineconverter.com/split-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">splitting your PDFs</a> to manage individual files.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Using <a href="https://cleanmymac.com/blog/best-free-iphone-cleaner-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone cleaners</a> can help you streamline your file management, ensuring that you only keep the necessary documents. This not only makes the application process smoother but also helps maintain a tidy and easily accessible digital workspace.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Be sure to submit all the required documents to ensure that there aren&#8217;t any hiccups in the process.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a list of things that you will need to submit as a part of your rental application:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Contact information:</strong>&nbsp;Your email ID, phone number, and address.</li>



<li><strong>Cover Letter:</strong>&nbsp;Make an impression and introduce yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Proof of Income:</strong>&nbsp;Submit proof of your employment if you&#8217;re a working professional.</li>



<li><strong>Social Security number:</strong>&nbsp;This is needed for background and credit checks.</li>



<li><strong>Documents:</strong>&nbsp;Identification cards or documents to prove your identity.</li>



<li><strong>References:</strong>&nbsp;Have a past landlord or supervisor vouch for you.</li>



<li><strong>Pets:</strong>&nbsp;Breed, size, and weight of your pet if applicable.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle information:</strong>&nbsp;The make, model, and registration of your vehicle if applicable.</li>



<li><strong>Emergency contacts</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It&#8217;s good practice to write a cover letter along with your application. Much like a job application, it lets you tell the landlord about yourself and make an impression. A cover letter also allows you to explain any issues with your history. You can explain prior convictions, failures to pay rent, evictions, or any other problems. A cover letter is an important part of the rental application process and shows you&#8217;re interested.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 3: Pay the rental application fee.</strong></h3>



<p>Generally, there will be a fee for you to pay as a part of the rental application process. This fee is usually between $30-$50 and varies based on location or the landlord. Usually, this fee is taken to fund background checks on potential tenants.</p>

<p>In some cases, there may also be processing fees that may or may not be refundable. Be sure to ask the landlord for a breakdown of the fees and whether they&#8217;re refundable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 4: Provide references.</strong></h3>



<p>Landlords will want to know if you had or caused any issues in the past. Proving that you have a good history is important. Landlords will not give an apartment on rent if you have caused property damage or broken the terms of your lease in the past.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a first-time renter and don&#8217;t have any rental history, get personal references! Personal references can make or break an application in these cases. A figure of authority or supervisor can vouch for your character and dependability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 5: Sign the dotted line!</strong></h3>



<p>Provided all has gone well and you’ve been accepted, you&#8217;ll now have to sign your lease. Congratulations! This is the final step of the rental application process. Make sure you go over all the terms carefully.</p>



<p>Also, take one final look at the premises and ensure everything is in order. This is also when you&#8217;ll need to discuss and pay upfront costs. It&#8217;s standard to pay the first month’s rent and move-in fees or security deposits as required.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How long does it take to process a rental application?</strong></h2>



<p>You can expect background and credit scores, references, residence history, other documents you&#8217;ve submitted to be checked as a part of the rental application process.</p>



<p>The time it takes can vary from one landlord to the other, but on average is around 24-72 hours. Some properties may take longer than this, but you&#8217;ll usually be informed in that case. If you haven&#8217;t heard back in 72 hours, you can contact the landlord and ask for an update.</p>

<p>New York City is a vibrant and diverse metropolis with countless neighborhoods to explore. While some areas may get more attention than others, there are plenty of hidden gems that offer a unique and authentic New York experience.</p>



<p>From cultural hubs to up-and-coming communities, these underrated neighborhoods are worth considering if you&#8217;re looking for a fresh perspective on city living. Discover the top 10 underrated neighborhoods in NYC to live in for 2024 and see why they&#8217;re the best-kept secrets of the Big Apple!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-underrated-neighborhoods-in-nyc">10 Underrated Neighborhoods in NYC</h2>



<p>New York&#8217;s about branching out beyond what&#8217;s familiar and comfortable. So, here’s a list of underrated neighborhoods in NYC that deserve your attention.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-yorkville">1. Yorkville</h3>



<p>I know, the Upper East Side (UES) gets a stuffy rap. This neighborhood doesn’t score particularly high on the “cool radar” but Yorkville has virtually no violent crime and overall an extremely low crime index. The neighborhood is also commuter-friendly as it&#8217;ll only take you around 15 minutes to get to Times Square with the Q train.</p>

<p>If you have little ones to keep in mind, then this best neighborhood in New York, should be on your radar. Thus, if you’re will to pay more for your sense of safety, Yorkville is number one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Flushing</h3>



<p>In contrast, Flushing is definitely cooler, and at the same time an underrated neighborhood in NYC. Besides being more affordable than the UES, Flushing has a great nightlife, bar scene, and food. You can do it all and not be broke come Monday. The entire neighborhood has a sort of hole in the wall feel adding to its mysterious personality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The biggest cause of stress for most of us in New York isn’t the traffic or the neighbors, it&#8217;s rent. The <a href="https://www.rentdata.org/new-york-ny-hud-metro-fmr-area/2024" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Fair Market Rent</a> in NYC for a two-bedroom apartment costs $2,752 monthly, 99% more expensive than in other cities.</p>



<p>And if you ever wanted to take a trip then that NYC apartment can start to feel like a ball and chain. What do you do then? It’s simple, sublet.&nbsp;That’s how you can enjoy your freedom and take time off to see the rest of the world. Here’s everything you need to know on how to sublet in NYC.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at&nbsp;what a sublet is, what it isn’t, and how you can do it&nbsp;in The Big Apple.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-sublet">What is a &#8216;Sublet&#8217;?</h2>



<p>A sublet is like a temporary leave of absence. Say you’re going to Europe for a month or two, but surely, you&#8217;re coming back. With so many people looking for a place to stay in New York City, it wouldn’t make a lot of sense to let the apartment sit there all alone without someone to keep it company. And pay your lease while you’re away. That’s why you should sublet an apartment in NYC. Lots of people need a temporary place because they just got to the city and need time to find something more permanent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-sublet-in-nyc-is-not-forever">A Sublet In NYC Is Not Forever</h3>



<p>That’s the difference between a sublet and assigning a lease. If you intend to come back, you need a sublet. If you&#8217;re trying to get out of your lease and you want someone to take it over completely, then you’re assigning it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-find-a-sublet-in-nyc">How to Find a Sublet in NYC</h2>



<p>Okay. The City of Dreams sleeps on a big fluffy bed made out of paperwork, so make sure to check off all the little details. Here’s the basic overview of what to do subletting in NYC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-gather-all-information-needed">#1: Gather all information needed</h3>



<p>It’s gonna feel like a lot, but none of it should be too hard to get.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The sublease length of the apartment in NYC. How long are you going to be out of town?</li>



<li>The name and address of the tenant from whom you’re subletting in NYC. Hopefully, you found them on Roomi because then you can use the chat feature to get all that from them if you don’t have it already.</li>



<li>Why are you subletting? Basically, the reason for your decision to sublet an apartment in NYC. Traveling musician? Visit family? Hula dancing?</li>



<li>Written consent of anyone else who has the primary lease with you, such as a guarantor or cosigner. Your roommate would be in for a surprise if they see another person they don&#8217;t know in the apartment without any kind of warning.</li>



<li>Finally, a copy of your own lease, if you can.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-find-a-subletter">#2: Find a Subletter</h3>



<p>A subletter couldn&#8217;t just be anyone. Ideally, someone you already know and trust is already a good candidate. Asking friends and family if they know anyone looking for a place is also a good way to find a dependable subletter. But the best way is to use a reliable room and roommate finder app, like Roomi.</p>

<p>With Roomi, you can list your room and have potential subletters right away. The app is safe with security and privacy measures like in-app messaging, thorough background checks, and ID verification. This ensures that you&#8217;re talking to a real person behind the account and not a scammer or fraudster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3: Be wary of rental scams!</h3>



<p>Scammers are everywhere but don&#8217;t let them come near your subletting process. Take note of these rental scams and don&#8217;t fall for any misleading links or ghost apartments.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fake rentals or listings: </strong>These are bogus property listings with attractive photos to lure renters and eventually scam them into making deposits, then disappearing right after.</li>



<li><strong>Overseas landlords: </strong>Some landlords say they&#8217;re in a different country so they can&#8217;t meet you in person. They&#8217;ll make you send an advanced payment to secure the apartment or for them to mail the keys to you, but once the money&#8217;s sent, they&#8217;re gone.</li>



<li><strong>Phishing scams: </strong>These are deceptive emails or messages asking people to click on malicious links or provide sensitive information to eventually scam the person.</li>



<li><strong>Identity theft: </strong>Just like phishing scams, identity theft is prevalent online. Scammers use a different person&#8217;s identity to pose as a landlord, providing valid IDs to earn the trust of renters, then once the payment&#8217;s been sent over and it&#8217;s time to get the keys, the property is already occupied or it doesn&#8217;t exist.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4: Check with your landlord</h3>



<p>Next, it’s your landlord’s part that moves the subletting process further. They might have more questions or need additional info. If they do, get it to them as soon as you can. Remember, you have to send a written request with all that jazz to your landlord. Use certified mail, and make sure to ask for a return receipt. Once you send off any extra stuff, the 30-day countdown begins.</p>

<p>Your landlord’s got 30 days to say yes or no. If they don’t get back to you at all, then that counts as a yes. Now, you can have a great sublet experience in NYC!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5: Make a backup plan, just in case!</h3>



<p>Although settling your subletting situation takes a lot of work, it&#8217;s best to have a backup plan just in case. Set aside some extra money if your subletter doesn&#8217;t push through or there&#8217;s any mishap that happens, at least you&#8217;re prepared!</p>



<p>You can also have someone check in with you in case your subletter stops communicating with you, or they can&#8217;t pay a month&#8217;s rent for any reason. Remember, subletting is different than becoming a part of or signing a lease.</p>



<p>Now, it’s New York, so it shouldn’t come as a big shock to find out there are exceptions and special circumstances. Check out the “Tenant’s Rights” document, courtesy of the Attorney General, for more information that’ll make a sublet in NYC way easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time To Sublet!</h2>



<p>In the exciting world of subletting in NYC, the possibilities are endless! With the right information and resources, you can navigate the sublet market with confidence. Just remember to plan everything down to a T, beware of rental scams, have a backup plan, use a reliable room finder, and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>

<p>Choosing a roommate is a big decision that can greatly impact your daily life, so it&#8217;s important to think carefully before making a choice. Before relocating, you have to consider what factors are most important to you in a potential roommate.</p>



<p>From cleanliness and communication to lifestyle preferences and financial responsibility, there are a myriad of things to consider when searching for the perfect roommate in 2024. By taking the time to evaluate these key factors, you can ensure a harmonious living situation and create a positive living environment for yourself and your new roommate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What To Look For In A Roommate: 10 Things to Consider</h2>



<p>The fastest way to find the wrong roommate is to have an unrealistic assessment of yourself. Make sure you have a real understanding of where you stand on things like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cleanliness</li>



<li>Weekly routine</li>



<li>Quiet hours/bedtime</li>



<li>Partying/drinking/smoking</li>



<li>Financials</li>



<li>Visitors and guests</li>



<li>Pets</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want your potential roommate to be honest about it, you need to make sure you&#8217;re being honest as well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Use Your Tools</h3>



<p>You could drive around with a realtor and look at six apartments on a Sunday, or waste an entire Saturday hosting an open house, but what if a roommate finder website could do most of the work for you and provide verified listings in a verified community – all in one place?</p>



<p>The modern sharing economy has multiple ways to find a host of rooms and roommates online. Some are great and some are not so great – and while we won’t go through every single one, we’ll let you know what to look out for and introduce some of the tools that you can take advantage of.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Compatibility Matching</h3>

<p>Answer a series of questions about yourself including your likes, dislikes, and other pertinent information to living with someone, and then search for someone based on their answers to the same questions. Not only will you save time searching for a compatible roommate, but you’ll also have a greater probability that you won’t be looking for a new roommate in a month. That’s a win-win.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Background Checks</h3>



<p>While there are certain laws around employment and landlord background checks, for roommate checks, you&#8217;re kind of on your own to find a credible service.</p>



<p>The good news is that some roommate finder websites include background check options. On Roomi, for example, many of your matches may already have completed background checks so you can be more confident in striking up a conversation.</p>

<p>Lifestyle includes daily routines or habits, sleep schedules, food preferences, allergies, and more. You don&#8217;t need to have the same lifestyle as your roommate, but it&#8217;s good to know whether you&#8217;ll have the same or at least similar to theirs. This way, you&#8217;ll have an understanding of how they are at home and outside of work.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Cleanliness</h3>



<p>Coming home to unwashed dishes, a dusty floor, and a full garbage can can be stressful. So, it&#8217;s important to find a roommate who takes cleaning as seriously as you do. Before committing to anything, make sure both of you are in agreement on how to clean your shared living spaces.</p>



<p>Aside from the cleanliness at home, personal hygiene is as important. You wouldn&#8217;t want to live with a person who doesn&#8217;t take their hygiene seriously and tends to smell after a few days.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Finances</h3>



<p>Money can be difficult to discuss and if you’re splitting rent and expenses, it&#8217;s not a topic that could easily be parked and returned to when you feel like it.</p>

<p>You may want to get proof of employment to ensure your future roommate will have an income to pay rent. Also, a simple credit check can not only tell you if a potential roommate has a history of paying their debts but can also uncover any prior evictions and mounting credit card debt – both of which may be red flags.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a tip: ask for a deposit. A deposit proves a roommate is serious and willing to put some skin in the game. It also protects everyone else if the roommate decides to flake out. Some sites like Roomi will help facilitate the first month’s rent to provide some extra security to all parties.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Guests</h3>



<p>One of the most underrated things to consider when choosing a roommate is what they think about guests in the apartment. Like friends coming over to visit, family members, and even romantic partners.</p>



<p>If you like hosting small gatherings or parties, your roommates must be okay with it too. It also has to be clear on who are the guests coming over and how long they plan on staying.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Values and Priorities</h3>



<p>Finding a roommate with the same or similar values and priorities as you is necessary to have a healthy co-living situation. Live with someone you can be friends with, someone you get along with easily so that you don&#8217;t encounter any problems in the near future.</p>

<p>Make sure to talk about quiet hours in the apartment, how to handle household chores, boundaries, and everything essential.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. References</h3>



<p>Is your new prospective roommate looking for a new place because they got kicked out of their last apartment? Well, wouldn’t&nbsp;you&nbsp;like to know! It’s totally reasonable to ask for a few references from former roommates. Aim to get an email and phone number for 2-3 references, and be sure it includes past roommates. People tend to divulge more in conversation, so try a phone call first.</p>



<p>And with the finances section above, you should also consider using your prospective roommate’s employer as a reference.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">10. Clarify the Little Things</h3>



<p>I know you’re in a hurry to move in or fill the empty room but if you don’t do it right, you may be going through the entire process again in just a few months. Make sure you get all the little things on the table so everyone is clear on whether or not you have a good mutual fit.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The exact cost of rent</li>



<li>The estimated cost of utilities</li>



<li>How long everyone is planning on staying</li>



<li>What furniture to bring/not bring (including silverware, plates, etc.)</li>



<li>Will any pets be moving in?</li>



<li>Food and how the refrigerator will be shared.</li>



<li>Parking!</li>



<li>Significant others and sleepover frequency.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time to Find a Roommate!</h2>



<p>Choosing the right roommate can make a huge difference in your living situation. With these ten considerations in mind, you can find the perfect match for your living situation in 2024. From cleanliness to social habits, there are many factors to take into account.</p>

<p>Thinking of going on a short vacation, but don&#8217;t want to keep paying rent while you&#8217;re not staying in the apartment? Subletting is the solution for you. To sublet means to rent out a room that&#8217;s already being rented for a short period of time. It&#8217;s a great idea to ensure your rent is paid and your room is still intact when you return. However, it&#8217;s important to do your research about NYC subletting laws before starting anything.</p>



<p>Remember that there are terms and conditions, and the rights to sublet involved in the process before you make money subletting. It isn’t as simple as saying ‘I want to sublet my room’ to a friend who pays your rent for you.</p>



<p>In fact, in some states, you can go to prison if you’re found subletting your room without getting your landlord’s approval! Make sure you’re following the rules and know all about the laws for subletting in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-things-to-know-before-subletting">5 Things to Know Before Subletting</h2>



<p>New Yorkers, if you’re thinking of subletting your room, you have more flexibility than other renters across America! It’s the only other jurisdiction (alongside <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/lifestyle/things-to-know-when-moving-to-chicago-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Chicago</a>) where subletting your room is allowed. That too, even if your landlord denies or ignores your request. But there are laws in place and some restrictions in subletting. Here are five things you need to know about NYC subletting laws:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-confirm-if-you-re-able-to-sublet-in-your-apartment">#1: Confirm if you&#8217;re able to sublet in your apartment</h3>



<p>Although subletting is legal in New York, there are restrictions in place for certain types of apartments. If you fall under&nbsp;any of the following categories, you&nbsp;may not&nbsp;have the right to sublet your room. So make sure you get permission from the relevant body in writing before starting to make money subletting:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Public housing residents or those who receive rent subsidies don&#8217;t have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Tenants that live in non-profit buildings don&#8217;t have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Tenants in co-op and condo apartments should consult their proprietary lease. Also check the building’s by-laws, as they may not have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Rent-stabilized tenants can sublet with a few restrictions: 1.) You have to maintain the apartment as your primary residence; 2.) You can&#8217;t charge more than the asking rent; 3.) You can&#8217;t sublet for more than 2 years.</li>



<li>Rent-controlled tenants don&#8217;t have the right to sublet by law and should check the clauses of their lease.</li>

<p>Your landlord has 10 days to ask for additional information, as long as it&#8217;s within reason. Then, if they fail to notify you whether they approve or reject your request within 30 days of your submission, it&#8217;s considered consent to sublet. However,&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">your landlord</a>&nbsp;can withhold the request if they have a good reason. As a result, you won’t be permitted to sublet your room by law. In circumstances where the landlord unreasonably withholds consent, you can go ahead with subletting your room anyway.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3: Subletting means you have to return to your apartment</h3>



<p>For subletting your room legally, you must plan on returning to the property once the term for subletting your room is up. If you think you’ll be gone for longer, speak to your landlord about breaking or re-assigning your lease to determine what the process should be.</p>



<p>As mentioned, you must have plans to return to the property after the term of subletting your room is over. But what happens when everything is going swimmingly? And you don’t want to go back to the room, and the new tenant has settled in? Can they take over your lease as per the right to sublet? Yes, they can.</p>



<p>Under NYC subletting laws, you must obtain written consent from the owner before proceeding. The owner is under no obligation to give their consent, nor do they have to provide a reason for denying the lease takeover.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4: Be aware of legal issues surrounding subletting</h3>



<p>If your landlord declines your request, and you still let another person sublet your room, there&#8217;s a high chance that you&#8217;ll be evicted for lease violations depending on your lease. With NYC subletting laws, certain legal issues could easily be avoided as long as you&#8217;re careful in planning and have everything in writing.</p>

<p>If your landlord rejects your request and you still proceed to sublet your room, you may face eviction. A case can be filed and if you lose, you can still keep the apartment by having the subtenant (the person subletting) move out within 10 days of the judgment. Either way, you&#8217;ll probably still pay your landlord&#8217;s attorney&#8217;s fees if your lease has an attorney&#8217;s fees clause. So, make sure to check and review your lease well.</p>



<p>One thing to consider is if you can actually make money while subletting, and the simple answer is yes, you can, with a few limitations. The right to sublet allows adding an extra 10% of the monthly rent onto the price when subletting your room. But only as long as the place is furnished. Your landlord also has the right to “sublet allowance,&#8221; another 10% of the monthly rent.</p>



<p>So as per NYC subletting laws, you can rent the room at 20% more than you pay. If you’re adding on more and the new tenant finds out, they can file a complaint and you’d have to pay a heavy fine.&nbsp;But if you&#8217;re in a rent-stabilized apartment, you can&#8217;t charge more than your current rent. <a href="https://hcr.ny.gov/office-rent-administration-ora#contact-ora" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)</a>&nbsp;is the state agency that governs this and contains up-to-date information regarding the latest updates to the right to sublet.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also the issue of illusory sublets where the main tenant hasn&#8217;t been in the apartment, meaning it isn&#8217;t their primary residence violating NYC subletting laws. A complaint can be filed by the cotentant which will require the owner to recognize the subtenant as the actual tenant who can renew their lease.</p>

<p>Having mice in your house can be a major nuisance and a cause for concern. These pesky rodents can cause damage to your property and pose health risks. But fear not, because there are effective ways to get rid of mice and prevent them from returning.</p>



<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll explore various treatment methods as well as prevention strategies to help you reclaim your home and live mouse-free. So, if you’re wondering how to get rid of mice in the house, keep reading for some practical tips and solutions!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-early-signs-of-mice-infestation">What are the Early Signs of Mice Infestation?</h2>



<p>If you think you have rats or mice in your home, here are some signs to look out for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You notice rodent droppings or mice poop around your house. You can find these small and dark brown jelly-bean-like droppings near food sources and under furniture. Even though you don&#8217;t see mice, they&#8217;re certainly around there somewhere.</li>



<li>There&#8217;s a foul odor. Smelling any unexpected foul odor around your home could be another sign of rodent infestation in your home. The rodent&#8217;s urine and droppings could smell like stale ammonia.</li>



<li>There are bite marks or gnawed holes. Rodents love biting through cardboard boxes, drywall, paper, food packaging, etc, in search of something to eat. If you find any part of your house with bite marks and gnawed holes, that&#8217;s a sure sign of a mouse infestation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-get-rid-of-mice-in-the-house-treatment-amp-prevention">How to Get Rid of Mice in the House: Treatment &amp; Prevention</h2>



<p>If you’re an animal lover or you know your&nbsp;vegan roommate&nbsp;is going to seriously object to causing any harm to the little critters, consider setting up some&nbsp;humane mouse traps&nbsp;around your apartment.&nbsp;Moreover, you might want to consider buying multiple traps to increase your likelihood of catching mice in the house. Indeed, the sneaky rodents travel stealthily.</p>



<p>Just remember this: if you&#8217;ve already seen one mouse, there&#8217;s a high chance that there are more.</p>

<p>The first thing you should do once you’ve seen mice in the house is contact your landlord. They have to schedule a visit with a pest management professional to inspect your place and safely eliminate the mice with their professional equipment. But before that, there are a few things you can do yourself:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1.&nbsp;Clean up any potential food sources</h3>



<p>This includes any of your food sitting on countertops, as well as animal food. Pet food should be off the floor and in sealed containers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2.&nbsp;Clean clutter areas where mouse activity is suspected</h3>



<p>Boxes, linen, and stashed holiday decorations are all recognized as safe harbors for mice in the house.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3.&nbsp;Identify all possible entryways in the house where mice can get in</h3>



<p>Common entryways include gaps around utility pipes and holes around walls and doors. Remember&nbsp;that mice only need an entryway the size of a dime, so don’t overlook any insignificant holes.</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-diy-pest-control-measures-for-your-home-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">4 DIY Pest Control Measures For Your Home</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Set up traps</h3>



<p>Traps are a bit old-school, but it still works as long as it&#8217;s set up correctly. First, you need to determine where the mice live in your home and place the traps there. Mice don&#8217;t usually travel far, so just look for signs of them (bite marks and droppings) to know where they are exactly. It&#8217;s also a good idea to switch up the traps every few days.</p>



<p>Some common mouse traps you can buy in your local grocery or hardware store are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Adhesive or glue boards: A piece of paper with glue covering the whole surface which traps the feet and body of the mouse with no way of escaping. The rodent then dies of hunger and exhaustion after 48 hours.</li>



<li>Victor Mouse traps: This is a pedal trap equipped with a covered bait (any kind of food), which the mouse lifts. The trap, then, immediately releases the kill bar to catch the rodent.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Use essential oils</h3>



<p>The answer to the question, &#8216;How to get rid of mice in the house naturally?&#8217;, is essential oils. Strong-smelling oils like eucalyptus and peppermint are your best bet when it comes to repelling mice as they irritate their noses.</p>



<p>To do so, try mixing 10 drops of essential oil in a cup of water, then spraying the mixture around your house (especially the possible entryways).</p>

<p>After your home is mouse-free, take some steps to prevent them from coming back. These tips will make sure you never see mice in the house again!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1.&nbsp;Make sure doors, windows, and all potential openings are sealed</h3>



<p>Getting rid of mice in the house isn’t that easy. So seal all openings! Remember how it only takes a dime-sized hole for a mouse to get in?&nbsp;Make sure you check every nook and cranny carefully to prevent potential entries for mice in the house.</p>



<p>Repair cracks on the exterior of your home (or ask your landlord to do this). They&nbsp;might be harder to identify if you live in an apartment building, but you can try asking your landlord to do a thorough check and repair.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2.&nbsp;Keep food stored properly in airtight containers</h3>



<p>Regularly clean under stoves and refrigerators where crumbs can gather. As much as possible, sweep and mop the floor after cooking. This way, you get a clean house and effectively prevent any rodent infestations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Dispose of garbage quickly and properly</h3>



<p>‘Tis the season to be the bigger roommate. Take&nbsp;the trash out immediately before another mouse infestation happens in your home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Basement leaks are a gateway for mice to enter the house</h3>



<p>Make sure your attic or basement doesn’t have a leak issue.&nbsp;Any source of moisture can attract mice, and you don’t want to face a mold issue on top of that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Conduct regular mice inspections</h3>



<p>To effectively keep mice out of your house in the long term, conduct regular mice inspections. You can have professionals do it, but you can do it yourself too. Here&#8217;s how:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Look through your whole house for any signs of mice.</li>



<li>Find and seal any possible entry points.</li>



<li>Never leave food out; always keep your food in a secure place, safely stored.</li>



<li>Tidy up your garbage, never leaving it exposed.</li>
</ul>



<p>Besides being obvious pests, mice can bring icky germs and food-borne illnesses, all the more reason to take serious measures in preventing repeat infestations in your home. Remember, mice usually live or frequent in unsanitary places like sewers or garbage piles, where they can acquire various bacteria. So it&#8217;s best to keep them off your homes for your health and safety.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mice in the House: Done and Gone!</h2>



<p>Getting rid of mice in your house is possible with the right treatments and prevention methods. Just remember to use the tips and tricks outlined in this article to ensure a mouse-free home and a healthier living environment.</p>

<p>Whether you’re traveling across town or just down the street, be prepared for the occasional delay or unexpected sight, warn locals.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. BART and Caltrain</strong></h3>



<p>BART, or Bay Area Transit, is another popular public transit option run by SFMTA. It&#8217;s the country’s fifth busiest heavy rail rapid transit system. The&nbsp;BART&nbsp;connects the heart of SF with numerous cities in the East Bay and suburbs in the south. In 2023, there was <a href="https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2023/news20230729" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">48 million</a> ridership on BART, so it’s no surprise SFMTA has&nbsp;plans to update the trains&nbsp;to be cooler, more comfortable and less noisy.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi’s tips for travel:</strong>&nbsp;The locals have an unspoken code of conduct for BART riders (no eating on the train, keep conversations and coughs to a minimum, let people exit before you get on, and don&#8217;t take up too much space). Definitely something you should familiarize yourself with before you become&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;rider.</p>



<p>Finally, Caltrain is a another commuter train similar to BART. It’s perfect for traveling between San Francisco and San Mateo and Santa Clara. This is your best bet if you’re trying to get to Silicon Valley from SF. Whereas you might want to take the BART if you’re just going to Oakland.&nbsp;Fares for Caltrain&nbsp;vary depending on the zone you’re traveling between, the number of rides you need, and how you&#8217;re paying. Essentially, using a Clipper Card is cheaper than a physical ticket. It’s best to check before hopping on-board.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis and Ride-Sharing Apps</h3>



<p>Like in all cities, San Francisco also has its fair share of taxis (mostly downtown), and ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft. This may be one of the easiest ways to get around the city, it isn&#8217;t the cheapest.</p>



<p>The base fare starts at $4.15 with an additional $0.65 per one-fifth mile and each minute of waiting or traffic delay. The pick-up fee in San Francisco is also $5.50.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Ferry</h3>



<p>Ferries are a fun way to tour San Francisco. It allows you to go to the Ferry Building and have a spectacular view of the Golden Gate Bridge. There are also a lot of ferry services in San Francisco that can bring you to different places around the Bay Area:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Golden Gate Ferry: going to Angel Island State Park and Larkspur to the north</li>



<li>Giants Ferry: to Oracle Park</li>



<li>Warriors Ferry: to Chase Center</li>



<li>San Francisco Bay Ferry: going to Oakland/Alameda, Richmond and Vallejo in the East Bay</li>



<li>Alcatraz City Cruise: departs from Pier 33 to &#8220;The Rock&#8221; or Alcatraz</li>



<li>Blue &amp; Gold Gate Ferry: to Tiburon and Sausalito from Pier 41</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Cable Cars</h3>

<p>Another option to get around San Francisco is by cable cars. It&#8217;s a bit more historic, so cable cars have limited reach as compared to other modes of transportation. The cable car has three routes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>California Cable Car: Goes from Embarcadero to Van Ness</li>



<li>Powell/Hyde Cable Car: Goes from Powell and Market to Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf</li>



<li>Powell/Mason Cable Car: Goes from Taylor and Bay to Powell</li>
</ul>



<p>To buy tickets to Muni, Caltrain, BART, ferries, and cable cars, you can use a Clipper Card. It&#8217;s the all-in-one transit card in San Francisco that you can add to your Apple Wallet or Google Wallet, or order a physical card online for free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Going Around SFO The Healthy Way</h3>

It&#8217;s convenient to <a href="https://www.guruwalk.com/san-francisco">walk around the city</a>, with easily accessible stores and shops all around.</p>



<p>Further, San Francisco has an extensive system of bicycle paths and lanes. Some of which are parallel to traffic and shared with pedestrians — some that are completely separate from both. Thus, walking and cycling form as efficient tips for travel in San Francisco.</p>

<p>With all the transportation options, now it&#8217;s time to consider the actual places and things to do in the city. Here are a few extra hacks that can come in handy when traveling to San Francisco.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>No doubt about it — moving to a new city is a life-changing decision that feels both exciting and scary. There are a lot of things you need to consider: rent, cost of living, the livability of the city, type of neighborhood, and more. These factors can cause quite a hassle, but coupled with the thought of finding a good roommate? Now, that’s immensely stressful.</p>



<p>With a city as big as New York, there are a ton of ways to look for roommates. There isn&#8217;t a lack of websites for this purpose, but there sure are certain features and elements that set the best apart from the basics.</p>



<p>Sure, you’ll have Facebook groups and Craigslist posts to explore. However, a more advisable way to find good roommates is by using roommate finder apps like Roomster, or the Roomster alternative, Roomi.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-roomster-vs-roomi-main-differences">Roomster vs Roomi: Main Differences</h2>



<p>Don’t worry about the stress of seeking the best roommate finder; we’ve done so for you!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are These Roommate Finder Apps Free or Paid?</h3>



<p>Roomi definitely comes out on top when compared with other roommate finder websites. This is because Roomi has no monthly subscription fees, no costs for messaging, and signing up and listing a space on Roomi is free. It’s even free to search for a place to rent.</p>



<p>However, to get the absolute best out of Roomi, it’s advisable to subscribe to its paid services. Roomi has three available subscription plans: the Premium plan for personal use, the Solo Agent, and the Business Unlimited plan for business users.</p>



<p>These paid plans include background checks, identity verifications, messaging plans, listing credits, profile boosts, and listing boosts. All of these are tailored to your needs with the following benefits:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Access to unlimited messages and swipes in your search for potential roommates</li>



<li>Post five to unlimited active listings simultaneously.</li>



<li>Free bookings</li>



<li>Fully verified status upgrade</li>



<li>Ability to boost listings with subscriptions</li>
</ol>



<p>Roomster allows users to pay for a 3-day subscription, which is enough to test the app. But a Roomster subscription costs $9.99 to $49.99. The subscription is automatically renewed after a month unless you cancel it manually. And based on some Roomster reviews, several users have complained about the exorbitant fees charged for things like viewing messages.</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/is-roomi-free-to-use/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Is Roomi free to use?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust">Security: Can These Apps Help Me Find Roommates I Can Trust?</h3>



<p>If you want to live with another person in a new city, it’s vital that you find someone who&#8217;s trustworthy and safe. Sharing your living space with another person is a big deal.</p>



<p>You would probably like to live with someone who takes hygiene seriously, respects boundaries, and is reliable. This is where roommate finders come in. Roommate finder apps such as Roomster and Roomi are great, but it’s normal to ask questions like, ‘Is Roomster legit?’ or ‘How well is my profile protected?’.</p>



<p><strong>ID and Contact Infomation Verification</strong></p>



<p>Roomster allows users to verify their identity using social media, email addresses, phone numbers, and identification with a simple process. However, due to voice-over-IP services, it has provided a entryway for scammers. Also, verifying your identity with Roomster isn&#8217;t an appealing process. Roomster requires you to send a scanned picture of your verification, then pay $14.99 to begin ID verification.</p>



<p>Moreover, Roomster reviews regarding the quality of ID Verification have not been positive, with users concerned about the additional fee required for identity verification. But with Roomster&#8217;s alternative, Roomi, identity verification comes with your subscription.</p>



<p>In order to assure users’ safety, Roomi makes sure to verify the identity of every user on the platform. Users are required to submit a government issued-ID before they can become verified users. And with this, you get a verified badge that&#8217;s useful in speeding up your search for a roommate.</p>



<p>Additionally, Roomi makes use of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/more-information-about-global-id/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">GlobaliD</a>, a digital identity platform that puts you in control of your identity and your data. With GlobaliD, you can have your number and email verified by Roomi, while your privacy is assured.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy and Security of Profiles</strong></p>



<p>Roomster allows you to create a profile where you can post stories, pictures and social media links to its community. They also ensure that all the information you add is authentic.</p>

<p>Roomi, however, allows users to share meaningful information that makes all the difference when searching for roommates. Visible information on a Roomi profile includes age, profile photo(s), preferred location, budget (if entered), move-in date, summary, work info, interests, roommate preferences, lifestyle, and more.</p>



<p>Roomi also offers its users secure in-app messaging, keeping the information shared between you and your potential roommate private. Another reason Roomi stands out as a great roommate finder app is that you can request for the deletion of all personal information after successfully finding a roommate. Users can do this under the General Data Protection Regulation Act by contacting <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/how-do-i-delete-my-account-on-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Roomi customer support</a>, or by filling out a form.</p>



<p><strong>24/7 Support &amp; Content Moderation</strong></p>



<p>It’s definitely disappointing to think you’re well on your way to finding a roommate while using a roommate finder app, only to realize that it’s not legit. You don;t have to worry about that with Roomi, as the platform has an in-house moderation team that works to remove spam profiles and fake listers from the platform.</p>



<p>24/7 customer support is also provided with an enlightening <a href="https://roomiapp.com/faq" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FAQ page</a> to answer all your questions and make your roommate searching easier.</p>



<p>Roomster provides customer service as well, yet some reviews say that they weren&#8217;t as useful, nor as around the clock as Roomi&#8217;s customer service.</p>



<p><strong>Criminal Background Check</strong></p>



<p>Roomi does optional <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/what-weve-learned-from-processing-over-100000-background-checks/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">criminal background checks</a> by Garbo<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for user profiles so that you know who you’ll be living with. Submitting your profile to Roomi for a criminal background check helps to boost roommate matches.</p>
