I’m very sorry to hear you’re experiencing this with your landlord at your property. I would advise contacting the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and file a complaint with Fair Housing at your local office. They may be able to provide additional resources to assist with your complaint. https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The apartment complex i am currently in is trying to evict me. I have been living at my residents in las vegas, nv for over 2 years and have always paid on time or early. Since moving in, the complex has changed owners 3 different times. During the most recent transfer of ownership records were lost and they are now claiming that their ledger has me behind on rent by one month. I have already given them receipts and they have made copies to send to there corporate office. They told me since its already put into motion.. all they can do at this point is see what the court says. What can i do?]]></description>
