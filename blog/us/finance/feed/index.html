										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the extensive digitization of the real estate sector, property management has become more efficient and exposed to cyberattacks. The more landlords and property investors rely on online platforms, intelligent security systems, and cloud-based data handling, the more they become susceptible to cybercriminals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Strategies to protect your real estate investment in the digital age should recognize the potential dangers of everything from general cybersecurity issues to protecting and managing extensive data and vendor management.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-establish-processes-to-protect-software-integrity">Establish Processes to Protect Software Integrity</h2>



<p>To ensure the security of property management software, financial records, lease materials, and maintenance logs must be protected. Cyber experts are usually looking for vulnerabilities in the software to access real estate systems unauthorized. Establishing <a href="https://www.wiz.io/academy/software-supply-chain-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">processes to protect software integrity</a> is key to preventing data breaches.</p>



<p></p>



<p>With access controls in place and constant software updates, the risk of exploitation is minimized. A great number of breaches are caused by outdated software with known vulnerabilities. As always, having all applications patched and in place and using security monitoring tools invariably enhances protection.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Conduct audits on all software vendors and get them to comply with cybersecurity standards; this strengthens them. If a property management platform does not prioritize software integrity, the chances that sensitive property data may be hacked become very high.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elevate-cybersecurity-standards">Elevate Cybersecurity Standards</h2>



<p>Digital property management makes cybersecurity a priority. Weak passwords and old software leave a real estate investment an open target for hackers to gain control. To protect your investment, use a <a href="https://psono.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">password manager</a>, password expansion policies, two-step identification, and advanced cryptography to limit access to sensitive information.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Cyber insurance provides an additional means of protection against possible damages. It covers losses from hacking, ransomware, or an organization&#8217;s data breach. Thus, with correct coverage, an organization would remain safe in case of an attack and secure any sensitive property-related information.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Regular software updates are vital for cybersecurity as well. Most cybercriminals target outdated systems and use loopholes to attack. Cyber threats will significantly reduce your real estate investments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conduct-thorough-vendor-security-checks">Conduct Thorough Vendor Security Checks</h2>



<p>Property managers need systems for third-party vendors. Maintenance, security, tenant management, and cleaning are all essential services for properties and their managers. Sometimes, a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/automate-security-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad vendor management system</a> may expose property owners to innumerable risk factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This could happen when the vendor opens pathways to your property&#8217;s digital nervous system. Therefore, thoroughly vetting the vendor to see how they align with your cybersecurity policies is a must.</p>



<p>Vendor security contracts allow risk mitigation. Such contracts outline a vendor&#8217;s primary IT responsibilities; they should hold the vendor responsible for protecting sensitive data and access to property management systems. Ensuring vendors adhere to industry-standard security practices will shield your investment from indirect cyber threats.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Regular audits of vendor security practices can help identify potential vulnerabilities. Vendors should be regularly required to provide cybersecurity compliance reports and submit background checks to verify that their systems meet your security expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A slip-up in vendor security can expose access controls to your property and your tenants, which can be dangerous to both.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secure-smart-home-and-security-systems">Secure Smart Home and Security Systems</h2>



<p>Smart door locks, security cameras, and automated property systems have become an easy way to create vulnerability in cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several systems of smart homes connect, posing a threat to your investment and tenants&#8217; lives when hackers take advantage of otherwise vulnerable systems and gain unauthorized access to your property. The proper configuration and secure maintenance of all intelligent devices are essential.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Smart security devices utilizing encrypted connections can protect data from hackers&#8217; interception. Many smart home systems connect via Wi-Fi, which ideally should have strong passwords and encryption protocols. Investment in high-quality, cyber-secure devices from recognized manufacturers will reduce potential threats.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Routine security updates and firmware patches for smart home technology fix many security loopholes. If the software is not routinely updated, it can serve as a secret getaway route for cybercriminals. Maintain a good habit of regularly checking and installing software updates so that no opportunities for illicit entry into your property remain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implement-data-protection-strategies">Implement Data Protection Strategies</h2>



<p>Investors and property managers deal with sensitive data, such as financial information, lease conditions, and tenant information. Such violations are expensive and may result in legal complications. Flawless data protection mechanisms are essential in guarding against unlawful access and dissemination of sensitive information.</p>



<p></p>



<p>What data must be kept safe is thus essential to security. Password-protected, encrypted files ensure that, even if hackers access your system, your sensitive information remains unreadable to them. Using secure cloud storage options with end-to-end encryption provides that extra layer of protection.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Access controls should also ensure that only a selected few are allowed to view and/or change property-related data. With role-based access management, access to particular information is only provided to individuals authorized to do so, thus minimizing the chances of internal threats or accidental data breaches.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-check-financial-transactions-regularly">Check Financial Transactions Regularly</h2>



<p>The complexity of financial fraud and mortgage cybercrime has also increased considerably. Cybercriminals frequently attempt wire fraud scams, phishing, and other unauthorized transfers. Utilizing monitoring systems to oversee financial transactions can reveal suspicious activity before the heavy damage begins.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Layering security systems in place is how banking transactions are made secure. Banks and financial institutions offer fraud detection software, which allows activities outside the set norm to prompt alerts. Use them to predict threats early.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Maintaining exclusive accounts for property transactions can prevent unauthorized persons from accessing personal or business funds. Segmenting rental incomes, security deposits, and operational expenses into three separate accounts considerably lowers the opportunity for financial fraud to attack each dimension of one&#8217;s investment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-back-up-critical-data">Back-Up Critical Data</h2>



<p>Data loss caused by cyber-attacks, hardware failures, or human-perpetrated errors can result in great monetary damages. Regular backups ensure critical property data is never lost permanently due to crises. An effective backup strategy calls for multiple copies stored in separate locations.</p>



<p>Choosing a secure cloud backup service that synchronizes itself regularly reduces the possibility of losing data. Cloud providers usually use security measures like encryption and redundancy to reduce the threat of cyber attacks on data secrecy.</p>



<p>Offline backups further secure the property by creating a third level of redundancy against emergencies. A physical hard drive or storage unit for an important signed contract or document ensures it is still available should an intrusion cause network failure or battles for access.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-use-of-secure-communication-channels">Use of Secure Communication Channels</h2>



<p>Real estate professionals, property managers, and tenants usually send sensitive information digitally. Communication channels with unsecured data naturally lead to data leaks, phishing, and unauthorized access to property-related documents. Secure channels always help protect confidential information. If email is the primary communication method, using a <a href="https://easydmarc.com/tools/dkim-lookup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DKIM checker</a> ensures the authenticity of emails, helping prevent phishing and unauthorized access to sensitive documents.</p>



<p>Encrypted email services and secure messaging applications are less susceptible than standard email and SMS. Standard <a href="https://www.sender.net/blog/business-email-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email providers</a> simply lack sufficient encryption to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-ends-partnerhsip-with-garbo-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safeguard against cyber threats</a>; switching to encrypted services does address that issue.</p>



<p>Motivating tenants and vendors to use highly secured channels for their online rent payments, maintenance requests, and document submissions raises the stakes for protection. Once more, avoiding public Wi-Fi for property management exposes the entity to more hacking attempts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cybersecurity-incident-response-plan">Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan</h2>



<p>Cyberattacks can occur despite the most diligent planning to prevent them. A proper cybersecurity incident response plan initiates immediate action to reduce the effects of a cyber attack. With a proper plan, money, tenants, and property are safeguarded.</p>



<p>With a team officially established with specific roles and responsibilities, call it into action to allow timely decision-making. Assigning members the duties of detection, containment, and mitigation improves the overall efficacy of your response.</p>



<p>Regular tests and updates of the incident response plan enhance its effectiveness. Conducting simulated drills can also allow you to enhance your procedures and ensure your team is ready when the need arises.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-endnote">Endnote</h2>



<p>Real estate investors in the digital age can expect their share of opportunities and risks. Proper cybersecurity policies, ongoing interaction with vendors, and regular monitoring of digital systems assure the safety of properties from hackers, long-term safety, and profitability of real estate properties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Transitioning from home ownership to renting is an exciting but responsible milestone. Living on your terms is made possible by your newfound independence but necessitates prudent money management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Understanding personal finance is crucial for first-time renters, and doing it correctly may guarantee a stress-free renting experience. You may successfully and more efficiently manage your funds with the help of this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-establishing-a-budget">Establishing a Budget</h2>



<p>One of the first steps to renting is creating a clear and realistic budget. Renting comes with several costs beyond just your monthly rent payment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/roomis-guide-for-the-first-time-renter/" class="broken_link">first-time renter</a>, you may need to familiarize yourself with the many expenses that must be factored into your budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how to break it down:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rent">Rent</h2>



<p>Your largest expenditure is rent, which should not take up more than 30% of your income. For instance, if your monthly income is $3,000. Try to keep your rent at $900 or less.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, where you reside, and your financial circumstances play a role. The aim is to ensure that <a href="https://junehomes.com/blog/2023/01/05/how-much-rent-can-i-afford/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rent comfortably fits your budget</a> while allowing room for other essential costs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-deposit-and-upfront-costs-nbsp">Security Deposit and Upfront Costs&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Most landlords want a security deposit &#8211; typically one month&#8217;s rent &#8211; before you move in. Additionally, some can wish to pay the first and final month&#8217;s rent in advance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember to factor in additional costs like background checks, applications, and relocating. Planning for these upfront expenses is critical because they may rapidly mount up. Moving in can go much more smoothly if you prepare beforehand.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-utilities">Utilities</h3>



<p>Additional expenditures to consider include utilities such as power, water, gas, and internet. If they are not included in your rent, you must estimate these costs depending on the size of your home and the number of people living there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To minimize surprises, find the typical utility bills in your region. Energy-saving behaviors can help keep these expenditures under control.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-renter-s-insurance">Renter’s Insurance</h2>



<p>While it&#8217;s not always necessary, renter&#8217;s insurance is a wise choice. It usually costs between $10 and $30 monthly and covers you in the event of theft, fire, or accident. You&#8217;ll be able to relax knowing that your possessions and responsibilities are protected for such a cheap price. If anything unforeseen occurs, it&#8217;s a simple method to prevent higher costs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emergency-fund">Emergency Fund</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s essential to have an emergency fund to deal with those &#8220;just in case&#8221; situations, such as a vehicle repair or medical cost. Strive to accumulate enough cash for three to six months&#8217; living needs. You won&#8217;t need it all at once, but putting aside a small amount each month can help you create that safety net and maintain financial stability in case anything unforeseen occurs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enhancing-liquidity-and-staying-prepared">Enhancing Liquidity and Staying Prepared</h2>



<p>Liquidity, or having enough cash to cover expenses, is crucial for renters. Unexpected costs like car repairs or medical bills can arise at any time. Just as contractors use systems like <a href="https://www.joist.com/trades/hvac-estimating-and-invoicing-app/">Joist HVAC invoicing software</a> to maintain steady cash flow, renters should ensure they have sufficient funds to cover rent, utilities, and other costs.</p>



<p>Automating payments and building an emergency fund will help you manage financial surprises smoothly. Apps like Mint or YNAB can track your spending and give insights into your liquidity, allowing you to make better financial decisions. By staying organized and preparing for the unexpected, you can maintain a stable economic situation throughout your renting journey.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-automating-your-finances">Automating Your Finances</h2>



<p>You have to stick to your budget and pay your bills on time. Not only may late rent payments damage your relationship with your landlord, but they can also <a href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/credit/how-to-improve-your-credit-score">lower your credit score. </a>Automating your financial transactions is one technique to prevent this.</p>



<p>You can set up automatic transfers with your bank so your rent is deducted on the same day every month. Doing this may prevent late fines and take the guessing out of remembering to pay your rent. You may use the same strategy for other monthly expenditures, such as utility bills.</p>



<p>To ensure you never miss a deadline, utilize the recurring payment capabilities if your landlord accepts payments online.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-managing-utility-payments-with-ease">Managing Utility Payments with Ease</h2>



<p>Utility bills can occasionally get tricky while renting, mainly if you live in a big apartment complex or share the expense with roommates. To keep things organized and clear, you may utilize applications to manage payments between housemates and divide costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Budget billing, which averages your utility bills over a year and costs a fixed amount each month, is now available from several utilities. This can reduce fluctuating payments, which can help you manage your budget more efficiently. Consider contacting your utility provider for energy-saving advice or even a home energy audit to determine where you may save money if you discover that your heating and cooling expenses are more significant than anticipated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-lease-agreements-and-tenant-rights">Understanding Lease Agreements and Tenant Rights</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s important to comprehend the terms of the lease and your rights as a renter before signing. A lease is a formal agreement specifying your obligations, the monthly rent, the lease length, and the guidelines for the rented property. Spend some time reading the lease, noting specifics like the security deposit clauses, your maintenance obligations, and the notice periods for moving out or terminating the agreement.</p>



<p>Knowing your rights as a renter might help you avoid possible trouble with your <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/" class="broken_link">landlord</a>. Learn about the local maintenance rules, eviction procedures, and rent hikes. Before signing the lease, don&#8217;t hesitate to get clarification or legal counsel if you have any questions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avoiding-debt-pitfalls">Avoiding Debt Pitfalls</h2>



<p>Many new tenants face the problem of wanting to use credit cards as a last resort to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Credit cards may be a helpful tool for managing cash flow and establishing credit, but avoiding taking on excessive debt is important. Credit card interest rates that are too high might send you into an impossible-to-break debt cycle, mainly if you can&#8217;t afford to pay off your balance each month.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble making ends meet, you might want to talk to your utility provider about setting up a payment schedule or negotiate a rent payment plan with them. As long as you are upfront and honest about your financial situation, many landlords and businesses are prepared to deal with renters with financial issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planning-for-future-rent-increases">Planning for Future Rent Increases</h2>



<p>Over time, rent rates often rise, particularly in markets with intense competition. As part of your budget, set aside money for future rent changes to ensure you&#8217;re not caught off guard by an unanticipated rise in rent. You may prevent financial hardship if and when your rent increases by having additional money, even if it doesn&#8217;t happen immediately.</p>



<p>Investigating your rights as a renter is also a good idea. Rent control regulations restrict how much your landlord may raise your rent annually in some places. You may negotiate better lease conditions and feel more at ease knowing these regulations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Although certain financial obstacles are associated with renting for the first time, you may efficiently manage your money with careful planning and astute techniques. These methods will assist you in quickly navigating the rental world, from defining a realistic budget to automating payments and keeping liquidity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, being financially independent will release you from the worry of being unable to make your rent payments on time and let you enjoy the freedom and independence that comes with renting.</p>

<p>Tired of playing detective to track down who owes what for the electric bill? Or maybe you’re just over the endless back-and-forth about who’s covering the groceries this week? Well, fear not, because, in the digital age of 2024, there’s an app for everything – including splitting bills with your roommates!</p>



<p>Say goodbye to sticky notes and awkward conversations, and hello to seamless bill splitting with these four awesome apps. Let’s dive in and reclaim our sanity, one bill at a time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-do-we-need-apps-for-splitting-bills-with-roommates">Why do we need apps for splitting bills with roommates?</h2>



<p>Splitting bills with roommates can be a challenge – or at the very least — unnecessarily time-consuming. Not to mention that it can be hard to see a situation clearly when you’re emotionally or financially invested — which is totally understandable. We’re all human.</p>



<p>Typically, when new roommates try to divide rent, they consider obvious inequalities, such as the size of the room and whether there&#8217;s a private bathroom. But this can lead to disagreements and arguments, and so these four apps to split bills with roommates have come to avoid that.</p>



<p>Before even picking an app to split monthly bills, it’s important to settle on a fair rent split. A great way to do that? Use a <a href="https://www.calculatored.com/others/productivity/room-size-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Room Size Calculator</a> to accurately measure each bedroom. This way, you can assign rent based on square footage and features, not just gut feeling. It eliminates guesswork and ensures everyone feels the arrangement is fair from the start.</p>



<p>They offer solutions for everything, from tracking bills to dividing rent and other expenses fairly. Splitting bills with a roommate helps organize and track who’s paid what.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-apps-to-split-bills-with-roommates">4 Apps To Split Bills With Roommates</h2>



<p>We’re always on the lookout for apps and tools designed to help make life better. Whether they organize monthly housekeeping or automate the day-to-day chores. What about an app for tracking roommate expenses?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few apps to use for splitting bills with roommates. Less stress on your plate and more time to enjoy your digs and explore your neighborhood — it’s a win-win. We’ll tell you what’s out there, you tell us what works for you!</p>

<p>With this app for tracking roommate expenses, you can track rent and everyday bills in the Spending Screen. This displays everyone’s standing in the house.

And it’s easy to see who should pay for the next communal expense.</p>

<p>A lease agreement is just a contract between a landlord and a tenant/renter that says how much should be paid monthly for rent and for how long. It&#8217;s a piece of paper that explains what you and your landlord have agreed upon.</p>



<p>Though it may seem intimidating due to the legal language used, but all you need is a basic understanding of what is it and you&#8217;re good to go!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How is a lease different from a rental agreement?</h3>



<p>While there isn&#8217;t a strict legal difference, in some instances, a rental agreement or a periodic tenancy may refer to a short-term rental contract. This term can be used in many contexts, but its most common usage is for month-to-month tenancy.</p>



<p>A lease agreement, on the other hand, allows the renter to lease a property for a set term, usually six months or over.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What does a lease contain?</h3>



<p>Any straightforward lease agreement will include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The terms of your rental stay. </strong>This includes your time of stay, rent amount, and additional fees you may incur. This section will also contain the requirements you need in order to stay in the house, legally.</li>



<li><strong>Rules and Regulations. </strong>Some basic rules include matters involving home maintenance, guest subletting, and pet guidelines. Not following these rules may lead to eviction.</li>



<li><strong>Legal notices. </strong>This section will include the legal terms that exist between you, your house, and the landlord. Renters’ rights, advise on lead paint, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Parking paperwork. </strong>If your lease includes an assigned parking spot, you may be asked to fill out a form identifying your car.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Types of New York Lease Agreements</h3>



<p>There are several types of lease agreements and you should know which one you need to properly manage your living situation.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Standard Residential Lease Agreement:</strong> This is the regular lease agreement between a landlord and a tenant for a residential space.</li>



<li><strong>Month-to-Month Lease Agreement:</strong> From its name, this type of lease doesn&#8217;t have an end date. It renews every month until it&#8217;s terminated by either landlord or tenant with a month&#8217;s notice.</li>



<li><strong>Rent/Lease-to-Own Agreement:</strong> This rental contract means the tenant will eventually own the property over a period of time.</li>



<li><strong>Roommate Agreement</strong>: A legal document that states all agreed rules and responsibilities of the co-tenants.</li>



<li><strong>Sublease Agreement</strong>: This document is used by a tenant to rent their place to a subtenant during a specified period.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you know what a lease is, the next step is the lease signing. It&#8217;s not anything grand, but it&#8217;s the process with a formal contract where you officially agree to rent an apartment. This agreement seals the deal between the tenant and the landlord, or representative of the landlord. This process can take place both in person or online.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. What to expect during a lease signing:</h3>



<p>A lease signing will take place after you receive the approval of your application to rent an apartment in New York. Some renters are asked to appear physically and show a guarantee of funds during the lease signing. Others are asked to sign and pay remotely or electronically.</p>



<p>Just remember that before signing anything, you should know your <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities.page" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">rights and responsibilities</a> as a tenant.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. When to expect a lease signing:</h3>



<p>A lease signing happens after the renter receives their approval based on their credit report and their financial qualifications. The schedule for this is based on whether the landlord decides to approve your application.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. What to bring with you during a lease signing:</h3>



<p>Lease signing day will be nothing if not a day filled with paperwork. The New York City government requires all potential renters to carry the following documents to lease signing appointments:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Proof of employment: </strong>Some of the most widely accepted documents for proof of employment in New York City include:
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Past two months of pay stubs (or bank statements)</li>



<li>Offer of employment letter (for new hires)</li>



<li>Income tax returns (for self-employed renters)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Photo identification: </strong>As required with any major financial undertaking, your lease signing appointment will also require you to bring along a photo ID. This would also mean carrying identification documents of any other people sharing the lease with you.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Letters of reference: </strong>While not mandatory, there are certain communities and property agents that require the submission of a reference letter before they lease out an apartment. These letters need to be signed and dated by the person writing them.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Proof of renters’ insurance: </strong>Renters’ insurance is meant to protect the renters’ belongings in the face of a natural disaster, burglary, or any other kind of damage. This is also a document that&#8217;s requested by many housing societies and dental agencies. Your landlord will let you know beforehand if this document&#8217;s required.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cheque-book, money order, or any other mode of payment. </strong>If you haven’t already paid your first month’s rent/security, this would be the day to do it. Based on your landlord’s preference, you can bring along a mode of payment to your lease appointment.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Vehicle documents/registration: </strong>Apartments in big cities, with limited parking spaces, usually assign a marked parking space to the tenants. So, expect your landlord to ask for your vehicle registration if you&#8217;re renting an apartment in New York in one of those buildings.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ask your landlord about any else that might be required. </strong>This one’s really important. A simple email or text confirming the details of your appointment can save you the trouble of having an entire day wasted over a piece of paper you forgot to carry!</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Who to bring with you during a lease signing:</h3>



<p>During a lease signing, usually only the landlord and tenant is involved. However, there are two more people you could bring with you during the process:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Your Guarantor: </strong>Yes, if your lease has mentioned a guarantor. A guarantor is a cosigner – so their signatures must also be present on the lease. Your guarantor not being present at the lease signing appointment could pose a problem, so re-schedule if need be. This of course is only applicable for in-person signing appointments.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Your Lawyer: </strong>While it’s not necessary to bring along an attorney to a lease signing in New York, some people prefer doing so. It’s frankly just a matter of preference. If you’re not comfortable signing a document without having an attorney look over it, take your lawyer along for the lease signing. If your lawyer can’t be at the venue, you can certainly request your landlord to send a copy of the lease to your lawyer.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Who gets a copy of the lease?</h3>



<p>Ideally, everyone who signed the lease agreement should get a copy of the contract. Tenants should always keep the copies safe, in case they&#8217;re required for reference in the future.</p>



<p>This is also important because some property managers charge the tenant extra to get another copy of the lease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New York Lease Agreements: Finding an Apartment!</h2>

<p>The first step to figuring out how to cut expenses is seeing what your expenses are. There are many ways to do this but the easiest would be to start writing down every expense. Whether you use your card or cash for it, make sure to write down the amount spent and the category.</p>



<p>If you like, you can also go back to the previous month or two and figure out how much you spent and on what. You can go the tradition pen-and-paper way or use a spreadsheet. The next step would be to see how many expenses are essential and how many you can cut out.</p>

<p>Before you figure out how to cut expenses, it’s important to know how much you have to cut. Making a budget can be taxing but you don’t have to make it overly detailed. A good, simple budget will simply have three categories – income, fixed expenses, extra expenses.</p>



<p>Once you have the first two categories filled, you’ll have an idea of how much you have left. Do you intend to save some of that? How much? After accounting for that, you can figure out what other expenses you can afford.</p>

<p>Budgeting and tracking expenses should show you how much of your income is going towards rent. You can find ways to reduce living cost at your apartment. For example, if you pay for a parking space, consider giving it up especially if you aren’t using it. If there are repairs to be done and they’re small enough, try doing them yourself!</p>



<p>But, if rent is cutting into your income to the point of you not having enough for other basic needs, it may be time to look at alternatives. If you’re renting, look for a cheaper apartment. Even if it isn’t in the most convenient location, you’ll end up saving a chunk of your paycheck!</p>

<p>How to cut expenses while living by yourself? A cost saving but fun way to do it is cooking more meals at home. This way, you can save a lot of money that you’d otherwise spend on takeout.</p>



<p>With endless videos on YouTube and recipes on the internet, you’ll never run out of new dishes to try. It’s pretty easy to find recipes that are quick and require less effort if you’re in a time crunch. Another tip is to make a lot of one dish when you have time on the weekend and freeze it so you have enough for the week.</p>

<p>When you’re thinking about how to cut expenses, maybe subscriptions are not the first item that come to mind. But when you really think about it, how many subscriptions do you use regularly? If you subscribe to multiple streaming services but always find yourself circling back to the same one, maybe that’s the only one to keep. Permanently or even temporarily stopping some of your subscriptions will help you reduce cost of living. These subscriptions can also include magazines or memberships that you don’t use often. If you have a gym membership, you might consider working out at home for a bit. Once you’re in a more financially stable situation, you can renew them all!</p>

<p>It’s harder to figure out how to cut expenses if you have credit card bills outstanding. Paying off your debts can go a long way in increasing the amount of money you have left to save. While it may not be possible to pay them all of immediately, you can increase your monthly payments. This’ll help you pay them off faster and help you in the long run.</p>



<p>Once that’s out of the way, you can also try freezing your credit cards for a short period. It’ll stop you from making impulse buys that you can’t pay for immediately out of pocket. This in turn will reduce the amount of debt that piles up over time. You can also freeze your cards before the debts are paid off. No new charges will be made to your card but you’ll still be able to make the monthly payments.</p>



<p>Another way you can reduce expenses and save money is by finding a roommate. When you have someone to split rent and other expenses with, the financial cost is a significantly less. However, finding a roommate isn’t an easy task. That’s why we recommend using a room finder that’s legitimate. <a href="https://roomiapp.com/">Roomi</a> is one of the best room finders with an unmatched roommate matching algorithm.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the things a lot of people avoid but sometimes can’t control is bad credit. Having bad credit can make apartment searching very difficult. Your credit score is very essential because it plays a major role when you want to rent an apartment. Most landlords demand to know the credit scores of their tenants so they don’t rent out to a tenant with bad credit. If your roommate has bad credit, this can pose major problems. Here are a few tips that can guide you.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be aware of your credit score</h2>



<p>This is because the landlords have access to <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/who-are-the-three-major-credit-bureaus-960416" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit bureaus</a>. They check if you are a worthy tenant or a tenant with negative information on your credit score. This check can drastically reduce your chances of getting an apartment. You should know what is on your credit report so that you can correct any errors. You should also be aware of your roommate’s bad credit.</p>



<p>Some sites can help you <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-check-your-credit-score-free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">check your credit score</a> for free. You can use <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.creditkarma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit Karma</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.creditsesame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit Sesame</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.credit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit.com</a>, or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.freecreditreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeCreditReport.com</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get financial recommendation</h2>



<p>To avoid situations where your roommate has bad credit, you need to get a financial recommendation before getting a roommate. You need someone to vouch for your roommate’s financial responsibility. This will prevent a situation of your roommate breaking the lease or having to sue your roommate for financial negligence. Your roommate can get someone to vouch for them by contacting their previous or current employers, previous or current landlords, or reaching the bank for a reference letter. Here are some concrete reasons why your roommate has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickclements/2015/09/10/3-reasons-responsible-people-have-bad-credit-scores/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad credit</a>.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Unemployment</li><li>Medical bills</li><li>Divorce</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get a roommate with a good credit score</h2>



<p>It’s said that you can get an apartment if you have a good credit score, even if your roommate has bad credit. However, it’s advisable to only get a roommate with a good credit score to avoid situations of unpaid rent or your roommate not paying for essentials that you both need. If both of you have good credit scores, it will help you make your payments on time and build your financial credibility for the future. Having no credit and a stable income that is 3 times more than the monthly rent is good. It shows reliability and gets you letters of reference from your former landlords when you need them. If your roommate has bad credit, they can submit any document that shows they are working on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-repair-your-credit-960377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repairing their credit</a>.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make your payments upfront</h2>



<p>Sometimes it’s a struggle to get a roommate, and when you finally get one that’s in sync with you, the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/bad-credit-when-finding-an-apartment-in-nyc-heres-help/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate has bad credit</a>. It is important to note that not all landlords check either your’s, your roommate’s, or both of your credit scores. This, therefore, enables you to provide proof of whomever’s credit score is better to secure the apartment. In addition, if that isn’t the case, you can pay a higher deposit upfront of 3 months. This will show how serious you are. It will show that you can be trusted and will subsequently ease the Landlord’s concerns. Also, the upfront payment helps to avoid your roommate breaking lease agreement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prove your worth and improve your credit score</h2>



<p>The fact that your roommate has bad credit does not mean they have not been entirely responsible for their finance. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-rent-an-apartment-with-bad-credit-960969">a stable income</a> can help fix their credit record and get that apartment for both of you. A stable monthly income, which is at least three times the monthly rent, will be a great indicator to your landlord when you provide solid proof that you can keep up with your payments. It is well known that <a href="https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/is-no-credit-better-than-bad-credit" class="broken_link">having no credit is better than bad credit</a>. Well, the first step to improve your credit is to catch up on all of your late payments and pay them in full to avoid additional interests. Sufficient income sometimes offsets a negative credit history.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The sheer number of us that have graduated from high school without actual knowledge of managing our finances, is insane. You’re in your 20s, trying to figure the world out, and suddenly you’re forced to deal with taxes, student loans, and rent. Don’t even get us started on the costs of entertainment and grocery shopping! It’s a tough life. But believe us or not, it doesn’t have to be that way. Achieving financial freedom in your 20s isn’t an insurmountable task. And most of us are ready for it! There are some easy and practical ways to approach our financial situations. And, completely doable, even if you’re dealing with debt and just starting on your financial journey!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-living-within-our-means-is-the-first-step-to-financial-freedom">Living within our means is the first step to financial freedom.</h2>



<p>This might seem like the most obvious piece of advice. But for many, it isn’t. Many of us have spent thousands of dollars on our credit cards, not realizing that instant gratification is just that. Instant gratification. It also comes with the added trouble of credit card interest and debt, most of which becomes a huge financial burden on those of us that can’t limit our spendings. And believe it or not, that’s a lot of us.</p>



<p>Living on a budget can be the best thing you can do for yourself, especially in your 20s. Life can be fun, without the extra spendings on a credit card!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-managing-whatever-debt-there-is-can-help-you-get-in-control-of-your-finances-fast">Managing whatever debt there is can help you get in control of your finances fast.</h2>



<p>When you have decided to create a budget for yourself, and skip on the extra credit card spendings, try focusing on managing your debt. This means, cutting down on your daily spendings, and whatever you’re saving, putting that towards the debt that you might be dealing with. This could be your student loans, car debt, <a href="https://www.freedomdebtrelief.com/learn/credit-card-debt/how-much-credit-card-debt-is-too-much/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit card debt</a>, and anything else you may have borrowed in the past. Most people also recommend picking up a side gig to help with their bills when they’re trying to get off of their debt.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-save-and-then-save-some-more-and-take-yourself-to-the-financial-freedom-you-ve-always-dreamt-of">Save and then save some more and take yourself to the financial freedom you&#8217;ve always dreamt of!</h2>



<p>Being able to save is a highly nifty and wondrous habit that takes a lot of willpower to inculcate. Unless of course you’re one of those people who save first, breathe later. (We’re highkey envious). Your 20s is the best time to start saving. Honestly, it doesn’t even matter if you’re 28 and just considering saving. Something is truly, better than nothing.</p>



<p>Consider the money that goes into a savings account an essential part of your budget (tip: you can even make it automatic by diverting a monthly amount into savings). Start with an emergency fund and go from there.</p>

<p>Yeah we mentioned this one briefly before, but this really is an important one. When you have the time, learning a new skill that you can sell as a freelancer, is yet another way of looking out for yourself financially.</p>



<p>Many people learn how to write if they’re good with communications, do accounting if they’re quick with numbers, and design stuff if they’re artistically inclined! It’s all about finding the sweet spot between things you can do and like to do. Start from there, and watch yourself find new ways to beef up your savings!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gaining-financial-literacy-and-learning-how-to-invest">Gaining financial literacy and learning how to invest.</h2>



<p>Most people, once they’re through their 20s, and thinking of the bigger picture, like marriage, and getting a house, find themselves wondering why they didn’t think about this same bigger picture before. Not all of us can be Youtube and TikTok famous in our 20s. (Though there’s no harm in trying!) And for those of us, it’s still possible to have a house before we reach our mid-30s.</p>



<p>Teach yourself as much as you can about things like investing. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/roth-iras">Open a Roth IRA</a>, and allow yourself to reach the financial freedom that you often find yourself dreaming about. The earlier you start investing, the more money you will have down the road, thanks to the awesome power of compound interest.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-establishing-a-good-credit-score">Establishing a good credit score.</h2>



<p>This is where our advice is just the slightest bit more complex. Once you have accomplished most of the aforementioned steps, start thinking about keeping one credit card, that you only sync those payments with, that you know your paycheck will be able to cover.</p>



<p>A credit card can be one of the most effective ways to achieve financial freedom, but only if you pay off the balance each month. You can also get a small auto loan or other small obligation that you can make monthly payments on. This will help you in the future as you buy a home, and even as you look for good deals on auto insurance.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests knowing what you exactly want in terms of accommodation when living on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re going to spend the most on rent and it&#8217;s not going to be frugal. You just have to be honest with yourself about what you want and you&#8217;re going to have to pay for it. The more roommates you have, the less you&#8217;ll pay. So remember that when you chart your living expenses budget in New York.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hyperside89 says you need to accept that rent is going to be your highest expense</h3>



<p>Rent is going to be your highest expense. Accept it, don&#8217;t fret over it. Some people will tell you to live in a place you don&#8217;t feel safe, or to cram 5 people in a two bedroom apartment to save money (slight exaggeration). Don&#8217;t do it. If your home is a place you want to be you&#8217;ll spend more time there, aka not being out spending money. I just spend the entire Sunday in my apartment cooking, reading, etc. Didn&#8217;t spend a dime. My rent is $1,100 a month (+ $40-60 on utilities) and so worth it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests moving to Manhattan for living on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>Move to Manhattan My BF and I live in the UWS and are moving next month. We have signed papers for a place in Harlem &#8211; it is up and coming and super convenient train-wise. Safe and very neighborhood-y. We will only be spending $1500 for a 1BR which is SUPER CHEAP. We will be able to afford to buy a used car soon and parking is also affordable up there. I love the neighborhood and it is totally worth looking into for living on a budget in New York.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage speaks the truth about commuting on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re going to spend the same amount on the subway as everyone else and there&#8217;s also nothing you can do about it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user Artichokeowl suggests knowing for sure how often you&#8217;d <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hacks-to-the-subway-in-nyc-we-all-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the subway</a></h3>



<p>One thing that helps is thinking about how often you will really need to take the subway or bus. If you know for SURE that you&#8217;ll need to take it to and from work/school every single day, go for the monthly pass. If you think you&#8217;ll take it less often, decide how you want to do it by figuring out how much you pay per trip given how often you take the subway with the different metrocard options. This is the best way to live on a budget in New York.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests Brooklyn for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/frugal-living-how-to-get-groceries-on-a-budget-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">grocery shopping</a></h3>



<p>If you go to deep Brooklyn for your groceries you&#8217;ll save soooooo much money. It&#8217;s awesome how cheap it is.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests Trader Joe&#8217;s</h3>



<p>Really worth the wait because every other place seems overpriced when living on a budget in New York. Just buy a granny cart and play sudoku on your phone. For the two of us, I only spend ~$120/month there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hyperside89 says cooking will save you tons of money</h3>



<p>Cook to live on a budget in New York. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/10-life-lessons-learned-from-cooking-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cooking</a> will save you SO MUCH MONEY. Don&#8217;t even worry about seeking out the cheapest groceries in the city. I shop at my local grocery store which has average prices and I only pay $180 a month in groceries. Don&#8217;t go crazy on caviar, etc and don&#8217;t go to Whole Foods for everything and you&#8217;ll be fine. For context, I do eat a primarily vegetarian / vegan diet heavy on veggies but not exclusively.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz also suggests cooking instead of eating out or ordering in</h3>



<p>Honestly, the food sucks for the price anyway. If my $50 meal was $20, I would buy it. But it&#8217;s actually $50 and very overpriced. I spend my money on nice food I cook at home. We eat out at quality restaurants once or twice a month. That way we sample a bunch of places and really look forward to it when living on a budget in New York.</p>



<p>On the same note, no take out.&nbsp;Resist. Save for snowy days when you are sick and there is a HIMYM marathon on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fitting everything else in your budget in New York</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests their choice of money saving apps and other financial management tips</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There are AMAZING <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-best-money-saving-apps-to-reach-your-finance-goals/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">apps for saving money</a> on various nyc happenings and restaurants. ScoutMob and Savored are my favorites for living on a budget in New York.</li>



<li>Drink before you go out if you want to save money on going out. Don&#8217;t go to places with cover charges.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s not easy to live on a budget in New York. But if you want to live here, you&#8217;ll make it work. Who needs a retirement fund anyway?</li>



<li>Edit: also Amazon Prime for all your shopping</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests investing in memberships</h3>



<p>I roller skate, enjoy French films and picnics during the summer. Thus, I purchase loyalty/membership cards to the rink and film festivals. I enjoy these things and buy them at rates so I can do them often, on the cheap. It is important to do things you enjoy and spend your money right when you&#8217;re living on a budget in New York.</p>

<p>Honest you CAN live within your budget in New York. My suggestion is to really really save as much as possible. Put away as much as you can. A job is really important to have once you get here because if you don&#8217;t you will eat into your savings damn fast. Happened to me. Had a place but couldn&#8217;t get a job for around 2-3 months. Really hard on my savings.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s super possible! It can just be hard.</p>



<p>Quick breakdown of my expenses per month:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rent: $560</li>



<li>Utilities: $75-$100</li>



<li>Phone: $100</li>



<li>Metro: $120</li>



<li>Food: $150-$200</li>
</ul>



<p>Some months are better than others. Sometimes I get lucky and make my payments on time, other times no. So don&#8217;t be afraid or ashamed to ask for help if you need it.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. There&#8217;s more to shelved items that meet the eye</h3>



<p>Avoid picking shelved items linear to your eye level as they tend to be the most expensive variant. Which also means no grocery shopping in a rush. Take your time and explore other brands of the product you have on your grocery list.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Bring Your Own Bag</h3>



<p>Think 360 degrees when you&#8217;re getting groceries on a budget in NYC. A shopping bag from the grocery store can cost anywhere between 50 cents to a dollar.</p>



<p>Also, you might need a couple of them depending on how long your grocery list is. You can easily save $10-$12 per month.</p>



<p>What more can I say, it&#8217;s budgeting baeby!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you’re a young entrepreneur, you already know that running a business is risky. It’s the nature of the game. Honestly, that’s part of the thrill. But sometimes when you’re young, ambitious and enterprising, you might also think that you’re invincible.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-financial-management-and-why-is-it-important-for-you">What is financial management and why is it important for you?</h2>



<p>Financial management is the backbone of every business. You cannot run a business, at least not a successful one, if you don’t learn how to manage finances well. That’s how companies go bankrupt and are forced to dissolve. Of course, that’s a risk you’re taking every time you think of running a business. However, there are steps you can take to mitigate financial trouble and avoid that very outcome. Which is where financial <em>risk</em> management comes into play. We know, all these words are enough to induce anxiety, but don’t worry!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-s-some-tangible-things-you-can-do-to-get-started-on-financial-risk-management">Here’s some tangible things you can do to get started on financial risk management-</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

This way you’re one step ahead of any potential disasters and can sidestep easily.</li>



<li>Avoid loans and unknown financiers as much as you can, this will really help you in the long run.</li>



<li>Make sure you pay off your outstanding debts and balances in a timely manner.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-golden-rule-of-financial-risk-management-have-a-plan-b">The golden rule of financial risk management: Have a Plan B</h2>



<p>We know this sounds like a cop-out, but trust us, it’s anything but! Having a backup plan is the sign of an entrepreneur who knows what they’re doing. Think about it, would you want to work for someone whose ambition has given them tunnel vision or do you want a pragmatic leader who’s thought of every possible outcome and prepared for the worst? Yeah, that’s what we thought.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/202006/bill-shapiro/pivot-plan-b-failure-strategy-twitter-slack-youtube.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">plan B</a> truly saves your business when things start going south. And trust us, things will go south at some point, that’s just how it is. But it’s all about how you recuperate from those failures that will define your career. So, get thinking about your plan B!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-all-about-the-work-work-work-work-work">It’s all about the work, work, work, work, work!</h2>



<p>So, now that you’re an entrepreneur, you really should get comfy with doing market research and cuz that’s your life now! Of course, when your business grows, you can get more and more people on-board to help you out here. But till then, this is your job.</p>



<p>Doing your market research is such an important part of the job, we can’t possibly stress this enough. How much impact your business has is directly related to how detailed your market research was. After all, a shocking <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-white/most-businesses-fail-why-investing-in-the-right-id.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">percentage</a> of businesses fail because there just wasn’t any demand for their product in the market. This market research will also help you come up with a solid and sustainable business plan. This, of course, directly helps with financial risk management and helps grow the business in the long run.</p>



<p>Incorporating data collected via <a href="https://www.uniqode.com/qr-code-generator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniqode&#8217;s QR code generator</a> also enables smarter financial forecasting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learn-how-to-weigh-the-odds">Learn how to weigh the odds</h2>



<p>By now you can already gauge how much of being a young entrepreneur is just assessing risks. Risk assessment is of course not an exact science and no one can ever precisely predict the outcome of a business decision. However, you can certainly take calculated risks while minimizing losses. When you’re starting out it can be hard to know instinctively which risks are important and which ones can be pushed aside for a while. This is where a simple pen and paper will help. Write down all the possible risks and their outcomes.</p>



<p>Once you have all the information, it’s easy to assess which ones are important and have to be dealt with immediately and which ones can be left in the back burner for a while. That’s how you come up with a proper strategy to be fully prepared. And that’s essentially what financial risk management is all about. Having a good strategy and exit plan to deal with any financial fallout in the future.</p>
