In some ways, sharing a house in NYC is just like getting along with roommates in an apartment building. But in other, less obvious ways, it&#8217;s actually pretty different. Here\u2019s some advice on how to live in a shared house in NYC so you can have a positive relationship with your roommates that is clean, healthy, and reasonably sane.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Home security<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you&#8217;re sharing a house in NYC, you\u2019ll need to approach home security a little differently. The apartment complex may have a main door to the entire building, and most of the apartments are above the ground floor. In a house, there are more points of accessible entry, and there is no backup plan like a secure apartment building entrance. Also, houses just look more tempting. In the mind of a potential thief, there\u2019s a lower chance of being seen because there\u2019s less people around and a better chance of finding valuable stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to think of a burglar as someone who flits from shadow to shadow in the middle of a moonless night. But<\/span><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/simplisafe.com\/blog\/break-in-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most robberies occur in the day<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In summer. When it\u2019s nice out. And you and your friends are off toiling away earning cash at your respective jobs. So it is ultra, super important that <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/rules-to-set-in-apartments-for-rent-with-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">everyone you live with<\/a> understands the necessity of locking doors and windows<\/span> in your shared house in NYC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><b>Careful what you say, the walls have ears <\/b>in your shared house in NYC<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you\u2019re out of an apartment building, you might think you won\u2019t have to deal with neighbors waking you up. Or depending on your lifestyle, you don\u2019t have to fret about waking up your neighbors. But keep in mind you\u2019ll have a better chance of getting sound insulation between two apartments than between two rooms in a shared house in NYC. Walls separating apartments may have concrete or other sound dampening materials. In the house, it\u2019s probably just drywall. If you share a house, you\u2019ll have to be even more careful about noise, not less.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Clean up crew<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharing a house in NYC typically means having more square footage than an apartment. Plus more communal living areas to share in a house in NYC. Bigger kitchens, bigger living rooms, scaled up entry ways. That\u2019s enjoyable when you\u2019re accustomed to living in an apartment that qualifies as a walk-in closet to your friend in the suburbs. But that also means more to surfaces to scrub. You\u2019re going to need to bring your A game and use elbow grease by the bucketful. Get the cleaning duties listed on an easily visible whiteboard in a communal area like the kitchen.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it gets sketchy in there then pests will come to investigate all those alluring aromas. Pest control is expensive, and it is often a landlord\u2019s responsibility to handle it.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But not always. It\u2019s easier to show that a tenant attracted the bugs in a house than in an apartment building. Nobody is going to be able to say \u201cOh, the guy in the apartment down the hall totally lured those here.\u201d If somebody in your crew drops the ball, you could get stuck with the bill<\/span> in your shared house in NYC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><b>Greater expectations<\/b> in your shared house in NYC<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of sharing a house in NYC are pretty cool, but the responsibilities are greater as well. Impress upon potential roommates before they move in that this will be a little different than living in an apartment. Security, cleaning, and noise considerations have to be made. Do yourself a favor and communicate clear expectations before anyone moves in. Work your expectations into the lease whenever possible.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you share a house? What do you do to keep a happy living arrangement?
