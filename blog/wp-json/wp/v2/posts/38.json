In fact, while the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the city was around $1,900 as of February. This number is far less than the $2,400+ price tag <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rentjungle.com\/average-rent-in-san-diego-rent-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">in Los Angeles<\/a>.&nbsp;And a whopping $4,100+ rent price <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rentjungle.com\/average-rent-in-san-francisco-rent-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">in San Francisco<\/a>, where housing has been in high demand. Like <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/affordable-housing-vanishing-fast-says-new-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">many U.S. metros<\/a>, San Diego\u2019s vacancy rate has been dropping rapidly in recent years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only 3.62 percent of San Diego\u2019s rentals were vacant in 2014, nearly 2 percent less than in 2011. When you compare this to the national vacancy rate average of 6.32 percent, San Diego proves to be as hard as many other large metros to find affordable housing. The good news is that San Diego residents may be able to rent up for a lower cost than elsewhere. That is if you know where to look. We talked to some local residents who offered their advice on how to snag luxury rentals. All while using a roommate finder and some San Diego know-how!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rooms-for-rent-in-san-diego\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Find Rooms for Rent in San Diego <\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s the Deal in San Diego?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1554844175-610aab2bf2b2?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" alt=\"seashore near buildings at La Jolla Beach in San Diego where using a roommate finder is the easiest way to rent big\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Affordability of San Diego Rentals<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Local renters like Walter Meyer are concerned about the rising rents in his city. But they recognize San Diego\u2019s relative affordability when considering the amenities and space to share. On average, renters spent less than 25 percent of their median household income on <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.census.gov\/programs-surveys\/acs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">median monthly gross rent in 2014<\/a>. Which means the average San Diego is not rent-burdened,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nccp.org\/publications\/pdf\/text_1043.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">by definition<\/a>. Meyer says he feels fortunate enough to live in a city where he can afford shared housing. That too in a nice part of town, even while the rents continue to rise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThe neighborhood in which I live, Hillcrest, is considered one of the most desirable in San Diego \u2014 actually, the country \u2014 it has made national lists of \u2018most walkable\u2019 or \u2018best neighborhoods,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of bars, restaurants, theaters, gyms, coffee houses, etc., and we are walking distance from Balboa Park and have easy access to all of the major freeways. We pay a price for this convenience \u2014 our rents do seem to be climbing faster than other areas.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Another local renter, Daeli Parker, agrees that if you have some help (like a good roommate finder), you can find the right place in San Diego and live a comfortable life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThe first place we rented was nice, as far as luxury goes: Rooftop pool, valet parking, etc.,\u201d she recounts. \u201cWe were right in downtown so everything was within walking distance, and that was a plus, including the trolley, which went as far east as El Cajon.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She continues that downtown San Diego sports a variety of options, many of them small and expensive, but with a few luxury high-rises which offer the amenities she had. But in these areas, the rent is high, and climbing, and the choice apartments might already be taken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Expenses and Rent Rise<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the median renter isn\u2019t rent-burdened, many in San Diego do feel the weight of rising rents, and the city is getting too expensive for some \u2014 making the need for a good roommate finder greater than ever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jessica Whitt* is sad to say it, but she\u2019s jumping ship later this year for greener (cheaper) pastures. Whitt, who rents alone and is fortunate enough to work from home (no need to commute), says she has no reason to pay high prices to stay put, though she won\u2019t be happy to say goodbye.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI love it here, but the rental market has gotten out of control,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery year they raise the rent, and it\u2019s impossible to negotiate because if someone new moves in, they can get more money from them. The attitude I encountered in general is that they\u2019re doing you a favor, which really bugs me because I\u2019m making them money.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a common complaint, even in other major cities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pro Tip: Use a Roommate Finder in San Diego to Rent Up<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whitt and Meyer had some advice for renters trying to score a rental (or keep one) in San Diego. Whitt recommends if you already have a place, hang onto it, especially if it\u2019s within your means.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cRenew your lease \u2014 if possible \u2014 during the \u2018low\u2019 season, which is September to March in San Diego,\u201d she offers. \u201cIn my experience,&nbsp;they\u2019re more likely to negotiate during that time. Also, if you know you want to stay there, renew for more than a year.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She also points out it\u2019d be easier to afford rising rent with the help of a roommate, as long as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/5-apps-guaranteed-to-improve-roommate-communication\/\" class=\"broken_link\">communication is solid<\/a>. Average renter household sizes have increased nationwide, and it\u2019s no coincidence. As rental markets get more expensive and more competitive, renters are making room for hopefuls.&nbsp;It\u2019s a way for renters to create more housing and lower cost for everyone without relying on developers and city officials to build affordable housing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meyer says the best roommate finder is a local renter in San Diego. So ask around, make friends, and get the word out there!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI hear stories all the time of people who called about an apartment and by the time they ran over to see it 20 minutes later, the place had been rented,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you have a friend or a friend of a friend who is renting, perhaps you can get it before they go public with the rental notice.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t know anyone in San Diego, but want to, you can check out&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.roomiapp.com\/get\/RC_CT_RConnect\" class=\"broken_link\">a few listings<\/a>&nbsp;using a roommate finder website or app and find someone with a lease. You can skip the hard stuff of applying and move right in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>*Person\u2019s name changed to protect privacy.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers use a roommate finder to rent big in San Diego?
