Of course, once in a while, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/5-things-to-do-if-you-cant-make-rent-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">anyone<\/a> can fall behind. But if your roommate is paying the rent late every month, you&#8217;ve got a problem. Unfortunately, there are no roommate police as of yet and rent still needs to be paid. For those who have found themselves in this unfortunate circumstance- here is what to do when your roommate is late paying rent.<\/span> <\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:66%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/wf71hhNOVYGK4\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/wf71hhNOVYGK4\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How do you approach your roommate who is paying the rent late?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><b> <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step to resolving the issue is understanding why it\u2019s occurring. Respectfully reach out to your roommate to genuinely understand why their portion of rent is late. This can help you decide what moral code you are willing to uphold. Keep in mind, your roommate is legally bound by a lease, so don\u2019t take on more than you can handle.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><b>Zero tolerance <\/b>towards paying rent late<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this approach to the situation you have to keep a few things in mind. The first is that this cannot become habit. The ol\u2019 nip-it-in-the-bud tactic is required. It\u2019s understanding when emergencies come up, but handling someone else\u2019s responsibilities, even in a small crisis, is not the way to go about it and may set you up to be a doormat. If the zero tolerance approach is something you\u2019re capable of doing, then execute it swiftly and efficiently. Rent is late, if they do not pay up you find another roommate or arrange to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/what-happens-roommate-breaks-lease\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sublease<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/htRB83wtJpWNtf9d5V\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/htRB83wtJpWNtf9d5V\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><strong>One and done<\/strong><\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the situation your roommate has found themselves in is so bad it\u2019s understandable and almost relatable. You have now agreed to cover them this month- just this once. Get your agreement in writing. Type up a simple contract with its conditions. Though not legally binding, this is a good way to give your roommate a deadline or due date to return to you their portion of rent. Do not accept on the terms that they pay your portion of rent next month. This leaves four weeks for a hit and run to occur. After all, they have already proven their unreliability.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Resolution<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have sought understanding and chosen to be tolerant or not, here are some long term decisions to consider in order to avoid or improve the situation. Have a heart to heart. If your roommates circumstance appears to be that of a habitual nature, express how detrimental being late or not paying rent can be to you and themselves. Evictions and damaged credit are hard hitters the next time you move. Speak to the landlord about adding another roommate- more people, less rent. If your landlord is accommodating it is also possible to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.avvo.com\/legal-guides\/ugc\/changing-your-lease-or-rental-agreement\" class=\"broken_link\">modify<\/a> the lease depending on the circumstance. Be open with your roommate about talking to the landlord in order to protect your own finances.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Avoid guilt trips or personal vendettas<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Money matters should not be taken personally, it&#8217;s simply not worth. Don\u2019t keep the issue from your <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi\/\">landlord<\/a>, and reach out to your roommate to collectively resolve the problem. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers deal with roommates who insist on paying the rent late every month?
