Here, everyone has their own personal living space, in addition to a shared common house. This house typically includes a large kitchen, dining room, den, and laundry room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cohousing communities represent a set of values. Much of the time, the ideals revolve around living in a manner that fosters connection, fosters a sense of caring for one another, and is environmentally responsible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/life-in-co-living-communities\/\">Is Life In Co-Living Communities Right For Me?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How intentional living can make us happier<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cohousing communities are organized around common space, so the relationships\u00a0extend beyond civility. There\u2019s a sense of unity and integrated support, which makes this concept a modern house with village virtues. People living in these communities collectively celebrate important occasions, new spouses, babies, and businesses. Moreover, offer comfort after the loss of a job or a loved one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is cohousing. It\u2019s dependent and personal, but for all good reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/hvp65kXxOS97g7K4aX\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/hvp65kXxOS97g7K4aX\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>When I come into the common house on a dinner night, the babble of voices lifts my heart.
