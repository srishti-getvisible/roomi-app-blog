Your dream of living in NYC has finally come true! After all that day-dreaming, hard work, and lots of saving- you finally have the key, literally, to your dream! But since this is New York you\u2019re probably going to have to share an apartment with some stranger you met 20 minutes ago. But let\u2019s not ponder over that! After all, you\u2019re living in NYC, the greatest city in the world!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before you go falling in love with the city, there are some things you need to keep in mind as a first-time renter, especially when you share an apartment. And we are here to help you with that. Consider us your New York guide who will show you all about making smart choices and investments so can have the perfect NYC life that you always dreamed of!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Living in NYC- Where do I begin?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We get that living in NYC is your dream, even if it means that you have to share an apartment. But before you go signing anything, you should make sure you\u2019ve done thorough research about what neighborhood you want to live in. And this research will have to be a little deeper than just re-watching Friends for the 100th time. Every neighborhood in the city is a world in itself- you need to find a neighborhood that suits your personality.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/ZIzN7YWNuTUYg\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/ZIzN7YWNuTUYg\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Of course, since we are your New York guide we will help you understand the personality of each neighborhood a little better. Here is a wonderful page to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.platinumpropertiesnyc.com\/neighborhoods\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">find out more about each neighborhood in New York<\/a>.

A short-term rental is basically any place that you will stay for a couple of months just to see what it\u2019s like living in NYC. This is a great way to experience living in a neighborhood of your choice and see if it really fits you. You can also assess who you want to share an apartment with during this stay. We know, the idea of a short lease can be scary for people, after all, you don\u2019t want to keep apartment hunting every two months. But this is an option for first-time renters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><strong>Roomi tip:<\/strong> You can use google for short-term rentals in New York, but to get the real picture, we suggest getting in touch with a real estate agent.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">See also- <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/guide-to-renting-cheap-apartments-in-new-york-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Guide To Renting Affordable Housing In New York Amid The Pandemic<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get your paperwork in order!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, picture this- you have found the perfect apartment- it\u2019s got everything you want- a big window, spacious kitchen and a bedroom.

Trust me, living in New York City is not child\u2019s play.

But you should learn to pace yourself. Don\u2019t buy stuff in bulk and put yourself in debt.
