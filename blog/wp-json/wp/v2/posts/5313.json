Surviving the holidays is easier if you have a plan!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to let your parents know what your COVID-19 holiday plans are! If you normally have a huge family get together over the holidays, you\u2019ll definitely need to discuss safety precautions this year. Every family is different, so if you decide that it\u2019s best for everyone to stay at home for the holidays, be sure that everyone is clear on that decision. Make sure you listen to all of your family members&#8217; thoughts and concerns about holiday gatherings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your circumstances, you might have to have some awkward &#8211; but essential &#8211; conversations with your family. If you\u2019re nervous to tell your family that you won\u2019t be home for Christmas, always have a game plan before you speak to them. Write down everything you want to say and make sure you cover all your bases!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a deep breath and remember that almost every young person is having the same conversation this holiday season with their family too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Staying home for the holidays? Make it fun!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you decide not to see family over Christmas and stay home instead because of COVID-19, be sure to make it fun! Moreover, if you have roomis &#8211; plan special holiday activities for the week leading up to Christmas and on Christmas day. Create new traditions with your roommates to get into the holiday spirit!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beat the holiday blues by watching your favorite holiday movies, bake cookies, gingerbread house, and <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classicfm.com\/discover-music\/occasions\/christmas\/nations-top-30-christmas-carols\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sing along to the Christmas carols<\/a> you love. Don\u2019t forget to buy gifts for your roommates and put them under the tree! TBH, surviving the holidays is easier when you have someone by your side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related : <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/stores-in-new-york-city-for-the-sustainable-shopper-roomi-2\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Christmas Gift Ideas For Shopping Small!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"9265\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-survive-the-holidays-during-covid-19-roomi\/attachment\/surviving-the-holidays-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/surviving-the-holidays-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"surviving the holidays 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/surviving-the-holidays-2.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/surviving-the-holidays-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/surviving-the-holidays-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A woman playing with her pet during the holiday season\" class=\"wp-image-9265\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/surviving-the-holidays-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/surviving-the-holidays-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/surviving-the-holidays-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Have a Zoom call with family on Christmas Day<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you decide not to be with family this year for safety reasons, be sure to set up a time to call your relatives on Christmas day. Communicate with everyone in your family and set up a time for a group holiday Zoom call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that seeing your parents and loved ones on a screen isn\u2019t the same as seeing them in person. However, it will make your day feel a lot more like Christmas when you do. Try setting up a time for all your family members to open presents together over Zoom. This way, you can enjoy some special moments together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Lift your spirits by doing activities you enjoy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year has been stressful to say the least. Not being able to see loved ones around the Christmas period isn&#8217;t ideal. But don\u2019t let it completely dull your sparkle. Make sure to practice self-care that&#8217;s the best way to surviving the holidays without getting sad or stressed. Get into the holiday spirit by doing little things each day that you enjoy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch a feel-good movie, catch up with an old friend, go on a hike, make your favorite dinner dish. Honestly, the possibilities are endless and the little things really do count!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, no matter what you do, do something each day that brings you joy. It really will make the holiday season seem a lot brighter!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers with a guide to surviving the holidays during Covid-19?
