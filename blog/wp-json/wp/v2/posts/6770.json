(All while treating yourself once in a while.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Let&#8217;s start by creating a budget<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, memes are funny. But when you have no money left by every 10th of the month, you don&#8217;t really feel like laughing, do you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s start financial management by creating a budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assess your necessary spending for every month &#8211; and how much you have left once you&#8217;ve deducted all of it. Don&#8217;t worry we&#8217;ll come to the &#8216;treat yourself&#8217; section too! But first thing&#8217;s first, start being accountable for the money you have!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"765\" height=\"499\" data-attachment-id=\"6791\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/managing-personal-finance-by-sticking-to-your-budget-roomi\/attachment\/start-by-creating-a-budget\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/start-by-creating-a-budget.png?fit=765%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"765,499\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"start-by-creating-a-budget\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/start-by-creating-a-budget.png?fit=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/start-by-creating-a-budget.png?fit=765%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/start-by-creating-a-budget.png?resize=765%2C499&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6791\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/start-by-creating-a-budget.png?w=765&amp;ssl=1 765w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/start-by-creating-a-budget.png?resize=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px\" \/><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/medium.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">medium.com<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Set aside some treat yourself dough and let it rest and rise!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you&#8217;ve deducted the necessities including rent, food, toiletries, etc., now it&#8217;s time to decide how to treat yourself. We told you we&#8217;d come to it soon!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/7-best-personal-finance-blogs-to-manage-finances-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">manage your personal finance<\/a> is to know where you like to spend money the most. Is it meals, drinks, or shopping for a cute tee every now and then?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if it&#8217;s multiple answers, set aside an amount of money that you can afford for your splurging habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But don&#8217;t go over and above it. Remember to treat yourself in a way that your future self doesn&#8217;t have to suffer. That&#8217;s how simple it is to manage your personal finance and stick to your budget!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Track your expenses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This one&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/the-best-money-saving-apps-to-reach-your-finance-goals\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a must for personal finance management<\/a>. Because mostly what happens is, we make a budget at the start of the new year or new month. And then, we conveniently forget about financial management when there&#8217;s an &#8216;oh-so-adorable&#8217; thing of our fancy on sale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how much the website says you&#8217;ll be saving, remember that you&#8217;re going to be spending, and NOT SAVING if you give in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/7-books-to-help-you-manage-your-finances-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">manage personal finance better<\/a>, write each of your expenses down. Even the ones you carry out on a whim. This will help you understand where you&#8217;re going wrong, and how you can improve your financial management skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Stop saving your card details online.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes! Even on Amazon. The thing is, the easier it gets to pay for something online, the tougher it is to stick to a budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we have no sense of how much money is slipping through our hands, it might seem harmless to make a $1 buy every now and then. But remember that the $1 you let go of, will come back to bite you on your broke arses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, remove your card details from shopping websites, and let the laziness of getting your card, putting in the details, etc. get the best of your personal finance!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Split it up in the name of financial management!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about debit cards, (we don&#8217;t even want to talk about credit cards here), here&#8217;s something you could do to make sure your personal finance goals are accomplished.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get multiple bank accounts and cards to split up your money!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a separate savings account where you transfer the money you need to save, right when you get paid. Then put that card in a drawer and don&#8217;t enter its details anywhere &#8211; using only for emergencies!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust us, financial management will become a lot easier this way. You&#8217;ll only be using the money that is purely for spending! So you can go crazy with it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So your new year&#8217;s resolution was to learn personal finance, make a budget and stick to it.
