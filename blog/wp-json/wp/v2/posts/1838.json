You&#8217;re now even bored of singing &#8216;I&#8217;m bored in the house, and I&#8217;m in the house bored.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Friends, when you&#8217;re bored with something, you only need to get a new perspective!

And they also could be talking about you behind your back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Plants are even able to communicate &#8212; they are extraordinary communicators. <mark>They communicate with other plants.<\/mark> <mark>They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin.<\/mark> <mark>They communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles, for example, during the pollination.&#8221;<\/mark><\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch this TED Talk by Italian botanist Stefano Mancuso, and you will never see your plants the same way, ever again!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-ted wp-block-embed-ted wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Stefano Mancuso: The roots of plant intelligence\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.ted.com\/talks\/stefano_mancuso_the_roots_of_plant_intelligence\" sandbox=\"allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin\" width=\"1250\" height=\"704\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.

To remedy this, he formed the idea of journeying about his house from room to room, to write a history of the world without leaving home. Whatever happens in the world &#8211; he demonstrates &#8211; ends up in our house, in the paint and the pipes and the pillows and every item of furniture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now, as you wander in your house, from room to room, feeling bored, you should pick this book up and reinvent the way you see your at-home living.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"320\" height=\"500\" data-attachment-id=\"8166\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/bored-in-the-house-heres-a-new-perspective-roomi\/attachment\/bored-at-home-try-bill-bryson\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Bored-at-home-try-bill-bryson.jpg?fit=320%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"320,500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Bored at home try bill bryson\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Bored-at-home-try-bill-bryson.jpg?fit=192%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Bored-at-home-try-bill-bryson.jpg?fit=320%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Bored-at-home-try-bill-bryson.jpg?resize=320%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Abstract cover art of a book by Bill Bryson\" class=\"wp-image-8166\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Bored-at-home-try-bill-bryson.jpg?w=320&amp;ssl=1 320w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Bored-at-home-try-bill-bryson.jpg?resize=192%2C300&amp;ssl=1 192w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.

Eating, jumping, drinking from a cup \u2013 things you&#8217;ve known how to do since you were a toddler suddenly become magical or tricky or endlessly entertaining, and sometimes all three at once.
