Yes, we are talking about some cool money saving apps in 2021!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TBH, money seems to have a strange hold over all of us, especially if we don\u2019t have it.

Each has their own saving style, so we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll find the right digital finance buddy for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/digit.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Digit<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hate thinking about money?

I love how quickly I\u2019ve managed to save money towards individual goals, as well as in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.qapital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Qapital<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Qapital is on a mission to help its users discover true money happiness. Its algorithms let users automatically save money in a smart way, but they can also set up savings rules. It\u2019s packed with tons of features that make saving money &#8211; dare we say it &#8211; fun. For example, team up with others to reach shared goals, learn to invest, and define your spending each payday.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A real review from the AppStore<\/strong>: I\u2019ve been using Qapital for years now and I have found it so helpful. Admittedly, I\u2019m not naturally the best with money. For most of my adult life I\u2019ve settled for living paycheck to paycheck with no cushion. However, with Qapital, I\u2019ve been able to save significant amounts of cash, by creating realistic, achievable goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mint.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mint<\/a>(One of the best money saving apps in 2021)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve seen Mint get referred to as \u201cthe Beyonce of money saving apps\u201d!

Mint cleverly analyzes your spending habits to create a budget for you, and presents everything in simple graphs.

It&#8217;s customizable and intuitive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.asktrim.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trim<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The clue\u2019s in the name: Trim is all about trimming down what you spend. It tries to find ways you can save money, for example on your cable subscription, internet or phone plan, medical bills, and old subscriptions you no longer use. That means no more getting ripped off on your bills, and more money for the things you need. Quite frankly another one of the best money-saving apps in 2021 that you cannot miss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trim review: <\/strong>I\u2019ve seen the most benefit from the bill negotiation service, and specifically from Trim\u2019s ability to get credits for cable and internet outages. And the text\/messenger alerts are a nice way to keep a close eye on whether my budget is out of whack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.longgame.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Long Game<\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Long Game takes a different approach; it takes the money that users would usually spend on lottery tickets, and puts it into a savings account instead. But why would these users give up their chance to win big? Well, everyone that signs up is entered into games to win extra money. The more you save, the more chances there are to win. It makes saving fun and cuts down the risk for those that sometimes take a gamble on their savings. A great way to save money, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>A real review from the AppStore<\/strong>: I forget about what I\u2019m saving and the missions make me excited to continue putting money away! Honestly it\u2019s the greatest app ever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Remember to always consult a financial advisor for professional advice.
