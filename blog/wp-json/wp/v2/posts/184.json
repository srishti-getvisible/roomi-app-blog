Advocated by lead author and <a href=\"http:\/\/sfbos.org\/index.aspx?page=11324\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">District 6 Supervisor, Jane Kim<\/a>, E.P. 2.0 is one landmark legislation that will change the grounds on which a lawful eviction can occur. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about renters protection in San Francisco!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a city suffering from an all-out housing crisis, E.P. 2.0 has been a hot topic since it was first proposed \u2014 and for good reason why. Here\u2019s what to know about the eviction laws in San Francisco and what this important new housing law, in particular, means for San Francisco renters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/renters-rights-landlord-provide-hot-water\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tenants\u2019 Rights: Does My Landlord Have to Provide Hot Water?<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the San Francisco Housing Crisis?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1617048551602-f377d4174089?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8OXx8cmVudHxlbnwwfHwwfHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" alt=\"renters protection in san francisco is now updated\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, why was this legislation being pushed, and why did it have so many supporters? In a nutshell: Affordable housing is nearly impossible to find. According to the San Francisco Department of Planning\u2019s Housing Balance Report from July 2015, the city added 6,559 affordable housing units between 2004 and 2014 but lost 5,470 rent-controlled apartments due to a variety of no-fault evictions. In the&nbsp;last five years, eviction notices have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cjjc.org\/en\/our-work\/housing-rights-campaign\/637-what-is-eviction-protections-2-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increased by a startling 67 percent<\/a>, according to the Rent Board\u2019s annual reports on evictions to the Board of Supervisors. Nearly 83 percent of those were no-fault evictions (an eviction that results from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smgov.net\/Departments\/Rent_Control\/Information_and_FAQ\/Newsletters\/60-Day_Notice_for_No-Fault_Evictions_Now_Permanent.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">nothing the tenant has<\/a>&nbsp;or hasn\u2019t done), according to Supervisor Kim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That significant rise has a lot to do with the spike in market rent in recent years, which means \u201cmany tenants face high rent burdens, which have increased rapidly in recent years,\u201d according to \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/sfcontroller.org\/Modules\/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=6574\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">General Obligation Bond for Affordable Housing: Economic Impact Report<\/a>\u201d by the&nbsp;Controller\u2019s Office of Economic Analysis. The result:&nbsp;sky-high rent and a threat to the function of <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/what-to-know-about-san-francisco-rent-control-laws\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">San Francisco\u2019s rent-control laws<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cWhen [other] one-bedrooms [are] going for over $3,000\u2026there\u2019s a lot of incentive for landlords to evict,\u201d says Kim. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it to evict tenants who are under rent-control, and then when they evict them, they can raise the rent market.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Because many property owners are forcing evictions by taking their properties off the market or hiking up rent prices, new affordable housing is lagging to catch up. That contributes hugely to the crisis, says Kim, and EP 2.0 is the solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rooms-for-rent-in-san-francisco\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Find Rooms For Rent In San Francisco<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are the&nbsp;Eviction Laws in San Francisco?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>E.P. 2.0 includes a number of new protections that will prevent landlords from unfairly evicting tenants through various tactics. Here are the basics of what it covers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sham Evictions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before this bill passed, eviction laws in San Francisco allowed landlords to evict tenants for some pretty petty stuff \u2014 things like hanging laundry, leaving a stroller in the hallway, or painting a bedroom. EP 2.0 and its campaigners refer to these as \u201cgotcha evictions,\u201d and the new law now requires landlords to provide a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to resolve disputes before issuing an eviction notice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roommate Restrictions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The bill also creates solid restrictions on additional roommates with the housing crisis in mind. Again, landlords could previously set arbitrary restrictions on roommates and could use new roommates as grounds for a no-fault eviction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cYou can deny [roommates] if you have reasonable discretion to deny,\u201d says Kim of the amendment. \u201cBut you can\u2019t deny based on a number maximum.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rent Limitations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>E.P. 2.0 sets rent limitations to protect the affordability of rent-controlled apartments and requires landlords to set base rent for the next five years as \u201cthe lawful rent&nbsp;in effect at the time of the vacancy in certain situations such as an Owner-Move-In eviction.\u201d That means landlords who issue a no-fault eviction cannot increase rent on the apartment for five years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThe country is looking at San Francisco to set the stage for solutions to these regional and national issues,\u201d said Maria Zamudio, Executive Director of Causa Justa::Just Cause, one of the lead advocates for EP 2.0.<\/p><p>\u201cThe Mission district is ground zero for the displacement of thousands of San Franciscans due to the rapidly growing inequality in our City. But today, we celebrate because the advocacy and tenacity of the tenant community has resulted in the passage of one of the strongest tenant\u2019s rights laws in the state. Today, the people won.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Language Barriers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, in acknowledgement the city\u2019s ethnic diversity, EP 2.0 requires the Rent Board to prepare a form in English, Chinese, Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog and Russian stating that an eviction notice may&nbsp;lead to a lawsuit to evict and stating that advice regarding notices to vacate is available from the Rent Board. Additionally, landlords must attach a copy of the eviction notice in the primary language of the tenant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Should You Care About Renters Protection In San Francisco?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, say you don\u2019t leave strollers in the hallway, you speak English, and you and your roommate don\u2019t have any plans to add another \u2014 you should still care about E.P. 2.0. The scary thing about no-fault evictions is that your landlord could claim anything is reason enough to evict you. And while most of San Francisco\u2019s housing is rent-controlled, the laws allow landlords to raise rent to market rate once an apartment vacates \u2014 meaning your chances of finding affordable housing are pretty bleak. So, ultimately, knowing your rights and your landlord\u2019s rights could mean the difference between moving and staying put lawfully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This bill is just a stepping stone towards more affordable housing in SF and a very comprehensive stepping stone. Kim says she will and always has been focusing on the production and acquisition of affordable housing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Renters protection in SF is finally letting us all breathe a sigh of relief.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers with renters protection in San Francisco?
