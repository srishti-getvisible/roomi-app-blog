Sleep. Health. Sanity. Work. It\u2019s all up for grabs. Will you find the perfect roommate who compliments your lifestyle, or will you get trapped in a nightmare situation with a certified crazy person who will slowly drive you over the edge? Here is some advice on how to find roommates in NYC:<\/p>\n<h2><strong>To start finding Roommates in NYC, start with number one<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The fastest way to find the wrong roommate is to have an unrealistic assessment of yourself. If you don\u2019t have a clear understanding of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.success.com\/6-steps-to-discover-your-true-self\/\">who you are<\/a>, how you play nice with others, and where your communal living skills could use some work, you\u2019ll never be able to find that complementary puzzle piece of a person.<\/p>\n<p>Identifying how good we are with people is the easy part for most of us. Yeah, we\u2019re awesome. You want us to tell you how awesome we are? We can totally do that in glorious detail. Weaknesses, however, tend to be a little tougher to pin down. Do you do all of your chores? On time? Without fail? Be honest. Do you ever make loud noises, like letting the door slam behind you when you come home late, or making <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/sharing-a-kitchen-a-guide-to-peacefully-share-a-kitchen-with-roommates\/\">vanilla-chai protein shakes<\/a> at the crack of dawn? Habitual actions are easy for us to tune out ourselves, but can be disruptive for those around us, and we don\u2019t even notice.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media.giphy.com\/media\/2UAedM32EiWHfVvhQu\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C258&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"480\" height=\"258\"><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h2><strong>Work on yourself&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Be extra-critical of anything you do routinely and ask yourself how it affects other people. Or better yet, just ask them. If it\u2019s been irritating them this whole time, they\u2019ll be all too happy to tell you about it. Also in glorious detail.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re one of those rare people who can launch into a clear, grounded <a href=\"https:\/\/lifeskillsthatmatter.com\/personal-self-assessment\/\">self-assessment<\/a>, it\u2019s still a good idea to ask some of your existing or previous roommates for a no-holds-barred critique. If you don\u2019t have a history of roommates yet, ask your family. You might be surprised to learn that you always trample up and down stairs so loudly you sound like you\u2019re storming a castle. Once you gather all the juicy data, use it to build an accurate description of your lifestyle choices, then add whether you have pets, your <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/how-to-save-money-while-living-in-midtown-east-nyc\/\">budget<\/a>, and other roommate basics.
