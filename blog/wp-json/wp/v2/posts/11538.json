And no, we\u2019re not talking about the crime. In LA crime is hardly an issue. It is a big city with millions of people, and it is more than safe to walk around alone in the morning. There is absolutely nothing to worry about in the night as well, as long as you\u2019re with another person or two. Likewise, living with roommates in LA can be really benefiting besides sharing rent and having company! If you&#8217;re thinking about moving or want to try living in LA with roommates, here&#8217;s what you should know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cost of Living in LA<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the many perks of being in LA, residing here comes at a higher cost than in most countries. The trade-offs may be worth it depending on your lifestyle preferences and desire for incredible weather. Median rents around Los Angeles are crazy expensive, $1,511 for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,982 for a two-bedroom. That&#8217;s above the national average of $1,101 for a two-bedroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:52%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/aWPGuTlDqq2yc\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/aWPGuTlDqq2yc\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>However, rents are less expensive than areas like New York City and comparable to other urban cities. Thus, living in LA with roommates, is a necessity more than a preference. It is the most convenient and affordable option there is!

After all, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be living with them for the years to come!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What should you discuss before moving in with roommates in LA?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions are the key element when dealing with roommates, maybe even more so than usual. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions when you first meet your potential roommates. For example, how do you feel about having guests over? Are you more of a morning person or a night owl? What are you allergic to? Are you a neat freak or are you a little messy?&nbsp;How often do you visit home? Ask these questions and be honest in your answers. There\u2019s no need for a filter here!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re living in LA, and juggling between work and personal stuff, you don\u2019t want your roommates to add-on to your problems.
