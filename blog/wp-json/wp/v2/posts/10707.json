There&#8217;s rent to think about and utility bills. And if you&#8217;re looking for living spaces in New York, there&#8217;s a high chance you&#8217;ve considered co-living in NYC as well. Co-living has become an extremely popular alternative to traditional housing options. It especially appeals to renters looking to save money! But also to those living spaces that come with a sense of community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is co-living? Why is it so popular?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent popularization of the affordable housing-startups has led to the rise in group housing for adults. And this is essentially what we refer to as co-living.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-living in NYC, as well as around the world, has taken many forms. We have witnessed the transformation of apartments as well as high-rise buildings. They&#8217;ve transformed into either dorms or single houses where groups of people live together!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-living housing often entails short-term or flexible leases. They include perks such as cleaning services, professionally furnished common areas, and turn-key amenities and utilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s also important to remember that while co-living, is a currently trending term. It may refer to this housing model we just mentioned, but it also has a broader meaning. And in a broader sense, this could mean anything from intentional communities where people live together, to just simply living with roommates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/whats-coliving-like-when-youre-over-40\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roomi\u2019s Guide To Senior Home Shares &amp; Having Roommates After 40!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason why this structure has risen to such immense popularity in recent times is the ease it provides to those looking for it. Similar to co-working offices, co-living disrupted the traditional housing model by borrowing the concept of resource sharing. Tenants trade personal space for a fully furnished bedroom, shared common areas, and sometimes group social events, all under a predetermined cost structure. While residents still have to deal with security deposits, and income requirements, coliving has made house hunting in NYC significantly easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s now take a look at the perks of co-living in NYC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">With NYC&#8217;s rental prices, co-living comes in as a very affordable option.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/workaholics-season-5-episode-2-3o6wrAkOFwn1PUFyN2\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media3.giphy.com\/media\/3o6wrAkOFwn1PUFyN2\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Season 5 Episode 2 GIF by Workaholics - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rent can be the biggest expenditure for a lot of us. New York in itself can be an expensive city to live in. So if you&#8217;re looking to save money, co-living in NYC is a great option to accomplish that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with living spaces, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/takeaways-from-an-iconic-coliving-relationship-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rent isn&#8217;t the only thing that makes our pockets sore.<\/a> Coliving, however, makes it slightly easier. Because even if you&#8217;re paying the security deposit and rent (which will be considerably lower than living alone), you&#8217;re still not paying for a couch, and wifi router!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Co-living in NYC comes with a ton of convenience.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/broadcity-season-3-episode-9-l1J9ROcCSp6ryQ8fu\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.giphy.com\/media\/l1J9ROcCSp6ryQ8fu\/giphy.gif?resize=474%2C260&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Im Gonna Be In And Out Season 3 GIF by Broad City - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"474\" height=\"260\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving into a new house requires a lot of household management, which in turn, requires a lot of time and money. But with co-living spaces, you don&#8217;t have to set up utilities, schedule monthly bills for essentials like wifi, gas, electricity, and spend time decorating your entire house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also the added benefit of sharing and negotiating chores with your roommates! Administration of living spaces in co-living settings takes a considerably short amount of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Co-living comes with a built-in sense of community.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/new-girl-fox-new-girl-newgirl-3oxRmtwrHmE9QB46wU\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.giphy.com\/media\/3oxRmtwrHmE9QB46wU\/giphy.gif?resize=500%2C281&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"New Girl On Fox GIF by New Girl - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Making friends as an adult is hard. But the great thing that comes along with living in a shared space, is that you always have a sense of having someone around if you need that. And then, familiarity breeds friendship like nothing else. And in no time, you who moved to a new city with no friends at all, will have found your circle!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-living in NYC particularly would mean living in a city like New York, and having a group of people who won&#8217;t just be having similar New York-ish experiences as you, but also might be well versed with the city in a way that could really benefit you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/help-im-stuck-coliving-with-roommates-i-dont-like-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Help!
