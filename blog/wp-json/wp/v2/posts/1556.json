Things you might have been willing to overlook before, come entirely into focus when you\u2019re staying in to flatten the pandemic&#8217;s massive curve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the aspects: coming face to face with each other\u2019s cleaning habits. There are different species of the human race when it comes to cleaning. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/help-roomate-is-a-slob\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the slobs<\/a>, the indifferent ones, the &#8216;wish I were cleaner, but I don\u2019t want to do anything about it&#8217; ones, the excessively paranoid ones, and the ones who do it once in a while as a form of therapy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your roomi is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/04\/03\/style\/ocd-coronavirus-challenges.html\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">diagnosed or shows signs of OCD<\/a>, you should be gentle and mindful about their condition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if they don\u2019t, and are suddenly bent on endlessly performing house cleaning during quarantine, then there are some things you could do:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cleaning during quarantine isn&#8217;t bad. Figure why it&#8217;s annoying you and talk to them about it.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Feels simple, doesn\u2019t it? We all know it isn\u2019t. But if their ways of cleaning during quarantine are acting as an obstacle to your peaceful dwelling at home, you need to talk about it instead of sweeping it under the rug.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t like confrontations, you could look at their display picture in the eyes and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/texts-resolve-common-roommate-conflicts\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">text them your issues to sort them out.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/QZ0vFWrpgccsZz4tNh\" title=\"MAY I TALK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT \"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find a middle ground between both your cleaning habits.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re bothered by their cleaning habits, there&#8217;s a possibility they might be bothered by yours. Try and meet at the clean middle ground. Even if you like a messy room to yourself, clean up after you use the shared spaces in your house. Keep the kitchen, pantry, bathroom, and living area tidy. If they still don\u2019t loosen up when it comes to cleaning, it\u2019s on them.

While both of these are good in moderation, you should check yourself and the people around you if it becomes an excessive habit.

Take the initiative, make a list, and share it with your roomis. The advantage of taking the initiative? You get to choose what you like and leave the rest for them!

Don\u2019t pick a fight or let it go, even if they start it.
