Using public transportation or driving&nbsp;through hour-long traffic aren\u2019t your preferred methods of getting around? Then biking through the capital city is another great option. For roommates in Washington D.C., who are already battling rising rent costs, using programs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.capitalbikeshare.com\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">Capital Bikeshare<\/a> or investing in your own two wheels can be both cost-effective and a great way to experience the city. But wait before you hop on and ride off into the sunset. First, familiarize yourself with the biking laws for when you find roommates in Washington D.C. who are like minded. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here&#8217;s a brief list of biking laws for roommates in Washington D.C.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stopping at lights<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many D.C. cyclists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/washingtondc\/comments\/4ayvsr\/anyone_willing_to_speak_about_biking_in_dc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">tend to agree<\/a> that it\u2019s OK to bike through red lights. Only as long as they aren\u2019t interfering with traffic or doing something that could cause an accident or harm others. Though it\u2019s a common occurrence, it\u2019s actually illegal and could land you in the slammer should something go awry. (You don\u2019t want to be <em>those <\/em>roommates in Washington D.C.)&nbsp;However, a proposal that would allow cyclists to simply yield at red lights is currently under review. And it \u201cwould apply to quiet residential areas where under current law cyclists are required to stop even when there\u2019s no one around,\u201d according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/dr-gridlock\/wp\/2015\/12\/08\/d-c-considering-letting-bicyclists-roll-through-stop-signs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">The Washington Post<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThe law would not allow any behavior that threatens the safety of others,\u201d says Tamara Evans, advocacy director for the Washington Area Bicyclist Association. \u201cStop as yield would apply where no one else currently has the right of way. It would help divert bicyclists from more dangerous streets to safer streets that they might currently avoid because those streets often have stop signs at every block.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Evans says that the proposal, which Council Member Mary Cheh introduced through The Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety Act, might also encourage the Metropolitan Police Department to concentrate on enforcing traffic laws that would be more likely to cause injury or death. Cyclists throughout the city, many who don\u2019t follow the standing law regardless, support the proposed bill. So when you find roommates in Washington D.C. who are cyclists, make sure you tell them that! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cUnder the law, cyclists would be required to stop at a red light, but if no traffic was coming, could then proceed through the intersection with caution,\u201d Evans says. \u201cThe law distinguishes between red lights and stop signs.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What you should know about riding two abreast with roommates in Washington D.C.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the weather is nice and you\u2019re looking for something to do, taking a bike ride with roommates in Washington D.C. is a great outdoor activity. Though riding two abreast (when two cyclists ride side-by-side) is legal, it\u2019s more common to see people biking single file. But because bicyclists can use the full lane they\u2019re in, riding two abreast occupies less of the road, according to Evans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThis is a contentious subject out of the city on two-lane roads, where it is difficult and sometimes dangerous (or illegal) for drivers to pass,\u201d says Evans. \u201cThere is an infraction for impeding the flow of traffic by riding two abreast, as we mention in the pocket guide. So it is somewhat situational depending on how many lanes of traffic there are.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"12628\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/an-intro-to-biking-laws-for-roommates-in-washington-d-c\/attachment\/roommates-in-washington-dc\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-in-washington-DC.jpeg?fit=1050%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1050,700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"roommates-in-washington-DC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-in-washington-DC.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-in-washington-DC.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-in-washington-DC.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A boy and a girl with one bike in Washington D.C.\" class=\"wp-image-12628\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-in-washington-DC.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-in-washington-DC.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-in-washington-DC.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-in-washington-DC.jpeg?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay informed about required bicycle parking<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New to biking and worried about where you would store your own? Fortunately, this is no longer a problem for apartment residents and roommates in Washington D.C. Especially for those who don\u2019t want the hassle of lugging a bike upstairs and finding room for it in their home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cAll new and existing buildings in the District now require bicycle parking,\u201d says Evans. \u201cLocations and types of bicycle parking must be shown in building site plans and be approved by the District Department of Transportation during the development review process. There are two sets of regulations governing bike parking in D.C. Code: Title 11 (zoning) shows number of spaces related to size of development and Title 18 (traffic) governs residential specifications, rack placement, and abandoned bikes, where bikes may legally park.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For a full list of D.C. bike laws, WABA\u2019s pocket guide is available <a href=\"http:\/\/www.waba.org\/resources\/bikelaws\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use capital bikeshare<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If buying a new bike isn\u2019t in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/tips-on-how-to-save-money-for-everyone\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your budge<\/a>t, Capital Bikeshare is the next best option. The program offers numerous passes allowing roommates in Washington D.C. to rent bikes to commute to their destination. As a member of the program, you can use a bike for a free 30-minute ride. An additional fee will be added to your bill if you go over the first 30 minutes. But every new bike you take offers another free 30-minute trip. So essentially, customers can bike for 30 minutes. Then park the bike in a Capital Bikeshare station (if one is available.) Take out a new bike and ride for 30 minutes again. Considering the inexpensive membership cost, many roommates in Washington D.C. enjoy the convenience of the program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cBiking is my primary mode of transportation. Plus, you can get practically anywhere in D.C. in 30 minutes,\u201d says Erin Gifford, a marketing professional. \u201cThe metro is terrible, buses are OK, and walking is great but slow. My company has nine locations throughout the D.C. area, so it\u2019s nice to be able to move about the city easily and quickly on a bike.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Gifford notes that it\u2019s frustrating when a bike isn\u2019t available, Capital Bikeshare\u2019s app and the station kiosks notify its members of availability at other stations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take advice from the pros<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a cyclist, you really can\u2019t win; cars loathe driving around you, and pedestrians will curse the day you accidentally side-swipe them on the crosswalk. Despite the reputation cyclists have with both parties, however, there are things you can do to avoid confrontation and prevent potential accidents. So when you find roommates in Washington D.C., here&#8217;s something to discuss before you venture out. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cMy number one rule is to be predictable,\u201d Mike Abrams, a D.C. paralegal says. \u201cIf the cars, pedestrians and other cyclists are expecting you to do what you do, you\u2019ll probably be fine.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Abrams advises practicing safety. Even as an experienced biker! That means going the correct way on one-way streets or using lights and neon vests when biking through the dark. Likewise, cyclists should exercise caution on sidewalks around pedestrians. And they should mind the actions of those around them. If, say, a driver is texting or a passenger of a cab is exiting the car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cMy biggest pet peeve when driving around cyclists is when they pass on the right at intersections,\u201d says Abrams. \u201cThe most dangerous interaction between cars and bikes is when the car passes the bike. The cyclist passing the car at the intersection just forces the car to have to pass the bike repeatedly, which is dangerous.\u201cIt\u2019s not worth the extra 20 feet by moving to the front of the intersection. When I ride, I try never to force someone to pass me more than once. I act like a car and stay in the middle of the lane at lights. Not saying the cyclist should move to the back of the line at an intersection. But forcing unnecessary extra passes is just stupid, in my opinion.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Document everything<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gifford agrees with the above notion. And while biking is her main mode of transportation now, she admits that cyclists and drivers attempting to pass each other at lights is a common problem. Of course, drivers and pedestrians have their own faults as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cPedestrians cross the street whenever they want and jaywalk, forcing me to slam on my brakes so I don\u2019t end up in prison,\u201d Gifford says. \u201cDrivers unaware get way too close, drive in the bike lanes and don\u2019t always look for cyclists. Pedestrians feel like they always have the right of way and refuse to pause for two seconds while I pedal past so I don\u2019t have to stop completely.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, it\u2019s not a bad idea to prepare for the worst case scenario. One precautionary&nbsp;action you can take? Using technology to document what happened.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use technology<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cI ride with a GoPro on my handlebars because D.C. has contributory negligence and that combined with MPD\u2019s general apathy toward bike\/car crashes doesn\u2019t leave me with much confidence,\u201d says Redditor tiny_apt_brewer. \u201cI got burned once so the GoPro became a $200 insurance policy.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not a bad idea, confirms another Redditor by the name of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/voikya\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">voikya<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cI do the same. I got hit by an Uber driver one time and it proved beyond any doubt that I was completely in the right. Completely paid for itself.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For roommates in Washington D.C., biking can be the ultimate way to experience your new city.
