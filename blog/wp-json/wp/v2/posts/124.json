You\u2019re on your own. The scent of freedom is in the air, as you triumphantly pack your meager childhood possessions and prepare to move out. You venture forth into the great unknown. You find a fabulous new place and a roommate to share it with. But then someone has a bright idea. Maybe it was your well-meaning mother. Or perhaps a friend who doesn\u2019t know any better. But someone suggests moving in with your sibling. And they\u2019re all about it. After all, you both need to split costs. And <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/rules-to-set-in-apartments-for-rent-with-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sharing household responsibilities<\/a> is something you already know how to do together. It\u2019ll be fun, right? Well, there\u2019s no turning back now. So before you resign yourself to sulking, here\u2019s the bright side of living with your sibling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Navigating living with your sibling<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypothetical situations aside, Caitlin Ledger lives with her brother in Philadelphia. And she says living with a sibling was a joint decision that\u2019s yielded many benefits. Ledger and her brother enjoy the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elitedaily.com\/life\/culture\/downsides-living-brother\/698130\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">comfort of familiarity<\/a>. Plus all the financial and social benefits of having a roommate, which allows them to experience a new city together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, it is a rough adjustment to be living with your sibling. After being apart for years, they found living together wasn\u2019t as easy as it had once been,&nbsp;having developed their own habits and ways of living over the years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cWe found ourselves bickering over how to do dishes, how the fridge should be organized, leaving the TV or lights on, and so on.\u201d says Ledger. So that&#8217;s something to keep in mind when living with your roommate. \u201cMy brother and two of my other roommates are night owls. Dan is a bartender and I work a 9-5. He likes to play his guitar and video games after he gets off work late. So there have been a few nights where I\u2019ve zombied down the hall in the middle of the night and had to close his door, or tell him to turn it down.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The ugly is easier to handle when living with your sibling<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also an altercation involving all the roommates. Who may have ganged-up on said brother about toilet seat etiquette and, of course, there\u2019s always the thing that\u2019s almost impossible not to fight about among roommates:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cOh my god, talking money with someone in your family sucks enough. But having to pay bills with him makes my head want to explode sometimes,\u201d Ledger says. \u201cWhat\u2019s different about living with your sibling is that we can easily call each other out on being irrational. And we have no filter with what comes out of our mouths. We\u2019ve had to have some conversations about this, realizing that we can\u2019t approach roommate situations with a sibling attitude. I can\u2019t pout and stomp my feet to get my way and he can\u2019t scold me like his little sister. It has to be two adults when living with your sibling, solving a problem logically and fairly.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You&#8217;ll make the best roommates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few weeks of moving in with your sibling and getting to know each other in your new roles as adult roommates, like Ledger and her brother, you&#8217;d realize how great living with your sibling actually is. Previous co-living experience really pays off when it comes to navigating the day-to-day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThere are lots of benefits to living with a sibling since you already know their habits. Dan <em>loves<\/em>&nbsp;to take long showers so I make sure that I get in the shower before him so I\u2019m not waiting for half an hour,\u201d says Ledger. We also both love to snack. So I\u2019ve been hiding some snacks I don\u2019t want to share in my room (which he\u2019ll find out about after he reads this, so&nbsp;I\u2019ll have to change my hiding spot)! And lastly,&nbsp;I can also tell when he\u2019s in a bad mood, so I know when to stay away or ask him what\u2019s wrong. In that sense, living with your roommate can be very comforting too!\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You&#8217;ll get all the support you need<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Armed with the knowledge of a sibling\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, and the ability to speak candidly, moving in with your sibling can help you enjoy a closer relationship than others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI consider my brother one of my very best friends,\u201d Ledger adds.&nbsp;\u201cWe bicker sometimes, but every time there\u2019s an issue, we get better and better at solving it \u2014 which I think will really help our relationship in the long run and yours too, if you plan on living with your sibling. We are already so close, but now I feel like we are becoming more friends than close siblings.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And even if they drink all the O.J. or bump Call of Duty at 2 a.m., you won&#8217;t regret moving in with your sibling. Your sibling was your first roommate, after all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Good, Bad and Ugly of Living With Your Sibling\" width=\"1250\" height=\"938\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PGMcDzQDC4w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers  decide on whether or not to move in with their sibling?
