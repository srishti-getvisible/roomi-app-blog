Check the single-family houses. That\u2019s right. Contrary to the idealistic image of roommates stacking up in a little apartment, one in five renters in Philadelphia are living spaciously in a <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">single-family house<\/a>. In fact, the trend of renting single-family homes has increased sharply as the vacancy rates nationwide plummet and rent climbs steadily. So it\u2019s no surprise roommates in Philadelphia are catching on. Here are some of the benefits you\u2019ll experience when you switch from an apartment to a house. Find roommates in Philadelphia who know that you don\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roommates in Philadelphia and Single-Family Homes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Empty Apartment Tour | What $1300 will get you in Philadelphia\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-cyozQSU0UI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Facts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Furman Center\u2019s 2016 National Affordable Rental Housing Landscape report, 70 percent of houses that changed hands between owners or renters were single-family homes. That were converted to rental units between 2005 and 2013. That basically means that houses were converted into rentals more often than they were sold. With the growing demand for rentals, and the incentive for homeowners to rent their house out rather than live in an increasingly crowded metro. It\u2019s not surprising when you consider the growing demand for rentals. Plus, there\u2019s an incentive for homeowners to subsidize their income by renting their houses to a swelling population of urban dwellers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cPhiladelphia in total is seeing an influx of renters on multiple levels in every asset class,\u201d says local property manager Benjamin Oller. \u201cPhiladelphia proper, specifically Center City is extremely hot.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"12792\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/roommates-in-philadelphia-opting-for-single-family-homes\/attachment\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1253&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1253\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"app-for-roommate-expenses-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"find roommates in philadelphia\" class=\"wp-image-12792\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/app-for-roommate-expenses-5.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oller, who works at Rent Philly pairing renters with landlords, says the growing demand isn\u2019t anything to worry about in the City of Brotherly Love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cWe see no shortage of inventory among any asset class,\u201d he says. \u201cIn real estate the old adage was and will always be location.

The city saw a 14-percent increase in rental units.Moreover, a 23-percent increase in renters between 2006 and 2013 \u2014 meaning demand outpaced supply. The long and short of it? Vacant rentals are a hot commodity, and homeowners and renters, alike, have something to gain from renting single-family homes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Benefits<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, to find for roommates in Philadelphia means paying close attention to those <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">open rooms<\/a> in single-family homes. If you\u2019ve lived the apartment life for years and find comfort in your small organized spaces, keep on doing you. But imagine the possibilities if you check into a house in Philadelphia instead.

Much. Space<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You remember that two-bedroom apartment you were paying an arm and a leg for in that other metro you called home? Imagine having an entire house between you and your roommates living in Philadelphia. It could be a two-story house, with plenty of room to stretch your legs between the kitchen and your very own bathroom. In a single-family house, you\u2019ll actually have the chance to have things you\u2019ve never dreamed of as an apartment dweller. Granted, you\u2019re unlikely to have&nbsp;<em>everything<\/em> you want, but things like garages, storage sheds, basements, and yards don\u2019t come standard with an apartment. And just think about how happy your four-legged roommates will be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Better Privacy<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, you\u2019re still rooming with other people, but at least you know everyone. Or, at least, you\u2019ll get to know them. Even a small house is still a house. It\u2019s separate from other houses nearby and only subject to the whims of the people living there. No more having to share a communal area with 50 other renters. Or awkwardly having to make forced small-talk in the mailroom. No more having strangers pass by your door in the middle of the night. Or brooms knocking on the floor or dance parties on the ceiling. And even if there are, it\u2019s nothing a calm conversation and <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/5-real-roommate-problems-and-how-to-resolve-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">open communication<\/a> can\u2019t fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"12794\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/roommates-in-philadelphia-opting-for-single-family-homes\/attachment\/apartments-for-rent-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/apartments-for-rent.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1253&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1253\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"apartments-for-rent\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/apartments-for-rent.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/apartments-for-rent.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/apartments-for-rent.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"roommates in philadelphia eating together\" class=\"wp-image-12794\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/apartments-for-rent.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/apartments-for-rent.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/apartments-for-rent.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/apartments-for-rent.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/apartments-for-rent.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/apartments-for-rent.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Worthwhile Price<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Roommates renting in Philadelphia can expect a warmer market than some other expensive metros. The average home sells in Philly for $121,200, according to Zillow. Compared to Boston at $480,000, or NYC at a shocking $614,500, it\u2019s considerably cheaper to be a property owner in Philadelphia. And the rent shows it. Boston rent averages around $2,300 for an inner city <a href=\"http:\/\/www.numbeo.com\/cost-of-living\/city_result.jsp?country=United+States&amp;city=Boston%2C+MA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one-bedroom apartment<\/a>. Whereas, Philly rent is an average of $1,470 for a similar one-bedroom <a href=\"http:\/\/www.numbeo.com\/cost-of-living\/city_result.jsp?country=United+States&amp;city=Philadelphia%2C+PA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in the city center<\/a>. If the suburbs are calling your name, you can rent a three-bedroom house in the Philadelphia suburbs for $1,570.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, The City of Brotherly love is a pretty awesome place for Philadelphia roommates to rent. (Just be cautious of a deal <em>too <\/em>good to be true.) Whether you\u2019re a current resident or are moving there soon. Keep your eye on the housing market for single-family homes as more Philadelphia homeowners jump ship in favor of renting. Or don\u2019t; they\u2019ll find something for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cTo each their own, which is what makes Philly, Philly,\u201d says Oller proudly.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find roommates in Philadelphia?<\/strong> <strong>With our ever-increasing lists of rooms and roommates across the world, we help you find your perfect match! <a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3vlBc8z\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download the app here and hop on the easiest ride home, ever<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking for roommates in Philadelphia?
