There are more masterful bait-and-switch artists then there are dudes working hot dog stands. Some roommates will have you knocking on the door to your local insane asylum for just one night of \u201cpeace and quiet.\u201d And let\u2019s not even start on the astronomical cost of living.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you aren\u2019t going to let that stop you. Why? Because NYC is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">awesome<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It is, without exaggeration, one of the most storied, entertaining, opportunity-rich places in the entire freaking world. Whether you\u2019re trying to move here or you are already proud to be a New Yorker, this isn\u2019t just a place to live. It\u2019s a dream in real time, an unshakable ambition.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We both know you aren\u2019t going to give up just because it\u2019s tough and expensive. If you were that kind of person, you\u2019d never have survived the plane ride over or made it a goal in the first place. So lets examine the different ways to find an affordable room in NYC and learn from the mistakes of others. Because New Yorkers gotta stick together.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Let Someone Else Find A Room In NYC For You<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brokers are actually kind of unique to NYC. In the rest of the US, people usually just handle apartment searches themselves. Lots of people turn to brokers in the hope that they will provide a competitive rate. In fact, some apartment complexes in NYC won\u2019t even talk to you unless you go through a broker. Like you\u2019re an author trying to submit a book to a major publisher who refuses you for lacking an agent. Only in New York, right?<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason for this bizarre phenomenon is pretty simple. Supply and demand. Despite the high cost of living, apartments of any quality from dubious to divine go fast. Let\u2019s keep in mind, NYC rocks the house down. Like, every day and in every way. (Okay, except apartment searching. Obviously.) So lots of landowners let brokers do the heavy lifting when it comes to filling vacancies. The drawback for you is that brokers charge a fee, often 15% or even more. To further complicate things, there is no shortage of scammers posing as reliable brokers. So there\u2019s no guarantee that working with a broker will be cheaper or safer. On to the next approach.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Find A Room In NYC On Your Own<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walk, drive, or take the train. Finding a room on your own sounds like a bright alternative compared to dealing with shady brokers or getting a door slammed shut in your face by an uppity landlord. But the biggest drawback is that New York. Is. Massive. Like, mind-bogglingly gargantuan. There is a reason that, in the movies, any monster wrecking New York is the size of a skyscraper. Because it would take a smaller monster way too long and we\u2019ve all got places to be. If you try to tackle it on your own, you\u2019ll never see 99% of what\u2019s out there, even if your one of those crazy marathon peoples who thinks running 26.2 miles in New York\u2019s 90% humidity in the dead of summer is somehow a good time. It\u2019s impossible to get a decent sampling of what\u2019s out there on your own. Which brings us to the final approach. And if you were worried there wasn\u2019t a good way to find an affordable room in NYC, fret not. We\u2019ve saved the best for last.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Find A Room In NYC With Roomiapp.com<\/b><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roomiapp.com has got you covered.
