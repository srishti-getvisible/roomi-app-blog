This experiment and its learnings prove we can &#8216;condition&#8217; our brains into doing what we desire when we desire it. Just like the dogs were conditioned to expect food at hearing the bell (stimulus.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to stop snacking on junk food and start exercising, YOU CAN! It&#8217;s all about creating a healthy home environment and cultivating healthy living habits for your desired results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how creating a healthy home environment can train you to cultivate healthy living habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-creating-a-healthy-home-environment-by-making-junk-food-disappear\">1. Creating a healthy home environment by making junk food disappear<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important healthy living habits is to ditch the packets of Nachos and Oreos for good. The two things that play a major role in making you eat junk food are salt and sugar. They&#8217;re extremely beneficial and necessary for the body in the right amounts. But addictive and detrimental to your health if you consume too much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/4249709\/salt-fat-overeating-sodium\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The taste you can\u2019t resist is due to the sugar or salt that\u2019s often present in fatty foods.<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s time to bid farewell to those packaged goodies for creating a healthy home environment. For further support in creating a healthy home environment and fostering healthy living habits, you might want to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.weightwatchers.com\/us\/registered-dietitians\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">talk to registered dietitians<\/a>\u00a0who are available for virtual nutrition counseling. They can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific health goals, helping you make informed dietary choices as part of your journey. To further support your goal of eliminating junk food and making healthier choices, consider incorporating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.factor75.com\/eat\/prepared-low-carb-meal-delivery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">low-carb food delivery<\/a> into your routine. This convenient option can help maintain a balanced diet without the need to stock sugary or salty processed foods at home, aligning perfectly with a healthy living environment. If you&#8217;re passionate about guiding others in nutrition and wellness, pursuing a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/und.edu\/programs\/nutrition-ms\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">masters degree in nutrition online<\/a>\u00a0could be a flexible and rewarding way to deepen your expertise and make a professional impact.

Similarly, you need to pick a space to work out in too! Choose a time of the day. Then choose a space that you religiously devote to moving your body for creating a healthy home environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be your balcony, porch, or even your living area if you plan to get your roomis on board as your fitness squad! Whichever space you pick, blast some music and make exercising fun to make this healthy living habit stick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget Pavlov&#8217;s dog training. Condition your mind to keep at it by giving yourself a reward when you exercise. And alternatively, setting up punishment for when you don&#8217;t. Make the punishment hard enough for you to stick to this healthy living habit and the reward good enough to reinforce it!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/1oImYxg0TMmKwQW12N\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/1oImYxg0TMmKwQW12N\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-observe-associations-and-triggers-to-overcome-them\">3.
