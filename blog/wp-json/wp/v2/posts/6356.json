There\u2019s no way to avoid them. It\u2019s one of the less pleasant parts of the whole coliving experience. And if you\u2019re a conflict-averse person, then it\u2019s probably even worse for you! I mean, no one likes fighting with the person you share an apartment with. After all, your home is supposed to be your safe haven, not a boxing ring. But no matter what you do, problems will arise and it is your job to deal with them head-on. Sharing apartments with roommates means you need to be respectful of one another. After all, your home should be your sanctuary. And we are here to help you with that. If you don\u2019t think you\u2019re good with conflicts, don\u2019t get stressed out. Here are some tips for conflict resolution that will make your coliving experience blissful!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/9PkfA9vqXSk2KvqiHj\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/9PkfA9vqXSk2KvqiHj\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Share an Apartment? You need rules!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re sharing apartments with roommates, most conflicts arise because you guys have different expectations of each other. Maybe you want your roommate to clean the dishes immediately after a meal. Maybe they expect you to clean the apartment more often. All of these things can pent up and will eventually make coliving a nightmare for you. So, the best thing to do is to set some ground rules before you even have any conflicts. These rules can be anything- whatever makes it easier to share an apartment with your roommate. If it helps, you can also write this down and stick it on the fridge.&nbsp; Now no one can back out of it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bustle.com\/articles\/179923-13-essential-rules-to-have-with-your-roommates-according-to-reddit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here is a list of essential ground rules that will make your life a million times better!<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:74%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l2YWoQRiaeN5IItzi\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l2YWoQRiaeN5IItzi\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Find a common ground<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re sharing apartments with roommates, you can\u2019t always be stubborn about doing things your way. That coliving etiquette 101. You need to be kind and empathetic towards your roommates and listen to what their needs are. You know, how when you\u2019re having a really bad day, sometimes you just want the other person to listen, and not give their opinions? That\u2019s kinda what you sometimes have to do when you share an apartment. When there\u2019s a conflict with your roommates, just sit down and listen to their side. Find a common ground. Believe me, this whole coliving thing will be a lot easier if you work hard to like the other person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">See Also: <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/texts-resolve-common-roommate-conflicts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Use These Texts To Resolve The Most Common Roommate Conflicts<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ask For Help<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, every once in a while you and your roommates will find yourselves in a situation where you just can\u2019t seem to agree with one another. Sharing apartments with roommates can be incredibly frustrating at times. Here is where you bring in an outsider. But be mindful, this person should be completely neutral to the problem at hand. If your mediator ends up taking sides, your coliving situation will only get worse from there. Instead, find a common friend or neighbor who will resolve this conflict for you in a kind and professional manner. This is one of the most mature ways to deal with conflict when you share an apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to know about what a good mediator needs to do<a label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/group\/resed\/resed\/staffresources\/RM\/training\/conflict.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">, check this out<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/JpHDHoVXBAzq2GCmkD\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/JpHDHoVXBAzq2GCmkD\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Talk it out before you walk it out!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever been so frustrated with your roommate that you\u2019ve just wanted to move out? Contract be damned. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve all been there. It\u2019s a quintessential part of the coliving experience. But you\u2019re an adult now, you can\u2019t give in to those petty impulses. Instead of walking out on the person you share an apartment with, talk it out with them. Don\u2019t shout, don\u2019t argue- just have a mature conversation about the problems you\u2019re having. If you talk to them in a calm, rational manner, they will respond in a similar manner.
