Living with someone from a different culture turns your home into a mini global village. You get a firsthand look at traditions, foods, and daily practices that books or documentaries can barely do justice to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Language practice:<\/strong> Ever wanted to learn Spanish, French, or Mandarin but found classes too dull or expensive? Well, if your roommate speaks a different language, it\u2019s a great opportunity to practice or learn a new language. It&#8217;s much more engaging and fun to learn by conversing daily than through books or apps alone<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Expanding your perspectives:<\/strong> Discussing world events with someone from another country can open your eyes to different perspectives. It encourages open-mindedness and can challenge preconceived notions you might have about other cultures.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>New friends and connections:<\/strong>: Having a foreign roommate often means they might have friends from other countries too. This can expand your social circle and introduce you to a diverse group of people you might not have met otherwise. It can be particularly valuable if you\u2019re looking into working or studying abroad.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cons<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Different daily routines:<\/strong> Your idea of early might be their idea of a sleep-in. Maybe your roommate comes from a culture where dinner at 10 PM is the norm, while you\u2019re used to eating by 6 PM. These differences in daily routines can be quirky at first, but frustrating if not navigated carefully.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Communication hiccups:<\/strong> Even if you both speak the same language, certain nuances and expressions can lead to misunderstandings. Sometimes, what\u2019s considered a harmless joke in one culture can be a rude remark in another. It\u2019s all about navigating these nuances with care and a good dose of humor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Privacy issues:<\/strong> In some cultures, it\u2019s normal to enter someone\u2019s room without knocking, while in others, such privacy invasions could lead to World War III in the apartment! Setting clear boundaries that respect both your privacy is key.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Household habits:<\/strong> Cultural differences can extend to everyday habits and lifestyles, from cleaning standards to cooking smells, noise levels, and even the way you spend your leisure time. What\u2019s normal in one culture (like leaving dishes overnight) might be a no-go in another. This might require adjustments and compromises that not everyone is comfortable with.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/co-living\/10-different-roommates-you-might-end-up-with-roomi\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">14 Types Of Roommates You\u2019ll Eventually Meet in 2024<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9 Tips For Living With International Roommates<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"740\" height=\"493\" data-attachment-id=\"21144\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/5-tips-for-living-with-an-international-roommate\/attachment\/9-tips-for-living-with-international-roommates\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/9-Tips-For-Living-With-International-Roommates.png?fit=740%2C493&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"740,493\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"9 Tips For Living With International Roommates\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/9-Tips-For-Living-With-International-Roommates.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/9-Tips-For-Living-With-International-Roommates.png?fit=740%2C493&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/9-Tips-For-Living-With-International-Roommates.png?resize=740%2C493&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"9 Tips For Living With International Roommates\" class=\"wp-image-21144\" style=\"width:856px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/9-Tips-For-Living-With-International-Roommates.png?w=740&amp;ssl=1 740w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/9-Tips-For-Living-With-International-Roommates.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/free-photo\/having-breakfast-home_5400469.htm#fromView=search&amp;page=1&amp;position=11&amp;uuid=ac7ef115-4eae-42b4-b8fe-d4c222da9a48\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">Freepik<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, here are some practical tips to help you navigate the rewarding yet complex dynamics of living with someone from a different cultural background.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Explore with your international roommate<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new city or country often means new stores and chains you don\u2019t recognize. For your international roommate, it could be quite a culture shock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take time to get to know the city together. Find a favorite grocery store, try a couple of happy hours, and just explore the neighborhood with your roommate even if you aren\u2019t best friends (yet).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you\u2019re done raiding the local farmer\u2019s market, schedule a night to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/co-living\/roommate-bonding-activities\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">try cooking a new dish<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014maybe you\u2019ll discover a new favorite you\u2019ve never heard of before!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust us \u2014 while it seems like a small gesture, it will help your new roommate feel at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This goes both ways, though! They might have some killer recs for you too. Never tried Ethiopian food? Who better to show you exactly how to eat that spongy bread than a local?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you and your international roommate have any sort of language barrier, just remember: Food is the universal language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/lifestyle\/the-cost-of-living-in-nyc-for-international-students\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">The Cost of Living in NYC for International Students<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Share cultural norms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to sharing stuff, it\u2019s always&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/co-living\/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">best to ask<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014 whether it\u2019s food or toiletries, don\u2019t just assume it\u2019s yours to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, you\u2019re doing that anyway, but sharing habits aren\u2019t always so common sense. Americans, for example, might be more casual about \u201cborrowing\u201d something than someone from abroad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wherever you stand on the sharing thing, it\u2019s best to talk about it early on to avoid any misunderstandings on either of your part. The last thing you want is to sour your relationship with your international roommate over some grapes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Be&nbsp;crystal clear about what\u2019s \u2018included\u2019<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s super important to be transparent about what&#8217;s included in your living arrangement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just about the rent and bills\u2014though those are key\u2014it&#8217;s about all the little (and not so little) things that can cause misunderstandings if they&#8217;re not spelled out from the get-go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s talk about the basics like utilities. Are all utilities included in the rent, or will you and your roommate be splitting the costs of things like electricity, water, and internet? This should be laid out clearly to avoid any surprises when the bills start rolling in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But beyond the financials, you should also discuss what living essentials are shared and what aren&#8217;t. Will you be sharing food, or is everyone on their own for meals?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about cleaning supplies or bathroom essentials like toilet paper\u2014will these be communal expenses, or is everyone expected to pitch in separately?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s one that often gets overlooked: space usage. Be clear about which areas are communal and which are private. Can you both use the living room for hanging out or hosting friends? Who gets which shelves in the fridge?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These might seem like small details, but they can lead to big headaches if they&#8217;re not hashed out upfront.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/apartment-hacks\/10-things-include-roommate-agreement\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">10 Things a Roommate Agreement Should Have for 2024<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Use a good app<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re moving to a new country and need some navigating the rental landscape, having the right tools can make all the difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where a reliable international roommate finder like <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Roomi<\/a> steps in.

Don\u2019t assume anything<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Assumptions can be the quickest route to misunderstandings. When you live with someone from a different cultural background, try to avoid jumping to conclusions based on your cultural norms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your roommate doesn\u2019t share much about their personal life, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re unfriendly. Some cultures value privacy and might take longer to open up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always ask and communicate instead of assuming; this will help you avoid many potential conflicts and help you understand your roommate\u2019s actions and responses better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/co-living\/8-common-behaviors-passive-aggressive-roommate\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">8 Signs of a Passive-Aggressive Roommate in 2024<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6.

It&#8217;ll be the easiest thing you can do with the largest payoff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Avoid using stereotypes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also important for you to recognize and avoid relying on stereotypes when interacting with your international roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s way better to get to know your roommate as a person. Ask them about their interests, their family, what a typical day looked like for them back home, or their favorite music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll likely find that they\u2019re much more than any stereotype could cover. Plus, this kind of open curiosity may help you build a more genuine and respectful relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/co-living\/roommate-harassment-laws\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">Roommate Harassment Laws: What Is It and Everything You Can Do About It<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8.

But then, little things start popping up\u2014maybe it&#8217;s dishes left in the sink longer than you&#8217;d like, or the bathroom becomes a free-for-all during your morning routine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to think, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll just let it slide this time,&#8221; but those little annoyances can quickly snowball into major irritations if they aren&#8217;t addressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trick here is to bring up issues while they&#8217;re still small. You might worry about coming off as naggy, but it&#8217;s really about keeping your shared space comfortable for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you notice something, say something (in a polite way, of course.) Your roommate might not even realize they&#8217;re doing something that bugs you. People have different living habits, and what\u2019s obvious to you might not be to someone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/co-living\/how-to-deal-with-a-messy-roommate\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">How To Deal With A Messy Roommate<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Be patient<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Living with a foreign roommate may test your patience in all sorts of ways. Think about it: each of us grows up with our own set of norms, and it can take a minute to adjust when someone else\u2019s norms crash into ours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, showing a bit of patience can make things much easier. It allows everyone some breathing room to adjust and find common ground. Remember \u2014 just like you\u2019re adapting to their quirks, they\u2019re adjusting to yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing patience gives you time to understand and respect your roommate&#8217;s needs and preferences and vice versa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wrapping Up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And there you have it! Living with an international roommate goes beyond just sharing a space\u2014it&#8217;s about sharing experiences, learning from each other, and growing together in unexpected ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these tips in your back pocket, you&#8217;re all set to make the most of this unique living arrangement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While sharing your space with someone from a different corner of the globe can be one of the most enriching experiences you\u2019ll have, it can also be quite challenging.
