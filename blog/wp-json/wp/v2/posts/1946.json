On top of that, if you have to face rejection, it can be disheartening and demotivating. The good news is, it doesn&#8217;t have to feel this way. You can work through the demotivation by rejecting to view job interview rejection as a failure. <strong>Or, as John C. Maxwell has quoted, \u201cSuccessful people reject rejection.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/cbc-schittscreek-schitts-creek-2Uy1J40PlLn3XFFAnz\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.giphy.com\/media\/2Uy1J40PlLn3XFFAnz\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dont Give Up Schitts Creek GIF by CBC - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be tempted to think you don&#8217;t have what it takes if your job interview doesn&#8217;t materialize as you were hoping it would. Like your roomis and your friends, we want you to remember that if something doesn&#8217;t work out, you might soon realize that it worked in your favor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead of letting a job interview rejection take a toll on your self-esteem, make rejection your friend and turn it into an opportunity instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are some things to do when you&#8217;re facing job interview rejection<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Job interview rejection and confused why? Ask for feedback!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no point in overthinking and self-analyzing why you were rejected. Because chances are, you will not get the right answer. Instead, you could ask your recruiter or interviewer to tell you what went wrong to be better prepared for your next interview.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do receive a bland answer in return, you should push them to give you more details. If another candidate was favored over you, ask them to tell you what you lacked as a candidate. Additionally, explain why you need an answer and how it will help you in your job search.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/DUrdT2xEmJWbS\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.giphy.com\/media\/DUrdT2xEmJWbS\/giphy.gif?resize=245%2C180&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The Office Questions GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"245\" height=\"180\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xpYSZfe2uz\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs\/\">6 Must-Have Skills For Individuals Seeking Remote Jobs In 2021<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;6 Must-Have Skills For Individuals Seeking Remote Jobs In 2021&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog\" src=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs\/embed\/#?secret=xpYSZfe2uz\" data-secret=\"xpYSZfe2uz\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Job interview rejection 101: It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s probably them<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s clich\u00e9d because it is true. If you&#8217;ve performed your best and did all you could to nail that last job interview and still faced rejection, then the company or position was simply not meant for you. That doesn&#8217;t mean you sit and blame the company for not understanding your true potential. Sometimes things don&#8217;t work out &#8211; and it&#8217;s for the best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe they didn&#8217;t see you as a fit for the environment, or the employer simply didn&#8217;t feel it in their gut to hire you. They&#8217;re human too, after all. And a lot of our decisions &#8211; personal and professional &#8211; largely depend on the way we feel about what our stomachs tell us. So don&#8217;t sweat over it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/WatchUMC-umc-know-your-worth-ahd-2jEJgBs4KJPzehLEvY\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/2jEJgBs4KJPzehLEvY\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Self Love Know Yourself GIF by UMC - Stream Black Better - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.

If you realize something lacks in your professional skillset, make this an opportunity to learn something new.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New jobs are being added to the job market rapidly because of technological developments and the pandemic. So you could make use of this interview rejection and sharpen your professional skills instead of feeling bad for yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/kimsconvenience-KyB0hdI0ssTIbDU5lM\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media4.giphy.com\/media\/KyB0hdI0ssTIbDU5lM\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Lying Andrea Bang GIF by Kim&#039;s Convenience - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.

You need to realize that recruiters are just doing their job, and we all know, sometimes we value finishing our work over giving our 100%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give them the benefit of the doubt. Thoroughly research the position and the company before spending too much energy on the job interview and the subsequent rejection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/rickandmorty-season-4-episode-10-rick-and-morty-McmcnVuc9tBVonergf\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media4.giphy.com\/media\/McmcnVuc9tBVonergf\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Working Season 4 GIF by Rick and Morty - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KmKtTZv2G7\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/6-expert-tips-on-making-a-career-change-roomi\/\">Career Change: A Fresh Take On Finding Your Passion<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Career Change: A Fresh Take On Finding Your Passion&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog\" src=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/6-expert-tips-on-making-a-career-change-roomi\/embed\/#?secret=KmKtTZv2G7\" data-secret=\"KmKtTZv2G7\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5.
