But, depending on the neighborhood you choose to live in, your rent could actually be quite reasonable. Brooklyn and Queens as well as some places just outside of NYC have <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/cheapest-apartments-around-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cheap apartments you can rent<\/a>. Yes, food can be quite expensive but there are definitely cheaper, more authentic options available if you want to live on a budget!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"20-people-are-unfriendly-\"><strong>People Are Unfriendly<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest myths about NYC is that New Yorkers are rude and unfriendly. Contrary to this belief, however, the city\u2019s inhabitants are actually quite friendly and willing to help out newcomers. Granted, they don\u2019t always seem to have the time, but they\u2019re definitely not just rude.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"21-it%E2%80%99s-unsafe-\"><strong>It\u2019s Unsafe<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a popular myth that is associated with almost every big city in the world. However, in NYC, the police force and firefighters do their best to keep inhabitants of the city safe at all times. In fact, crime in NYC has dropped by 5.4% in the last year with a huge 30.7% decrease in shooting crimes. So really, you can enjoy the beauty of NYC without worrying too much about crime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"22-it%E2%80%99s-a-concrete-jungle-\"><strong>It\u2019s A Concrete Jungle<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Is NYC the land of skyscrapers? Absolutely. But, does this mean it\u2019s a concrete jungle? Absolutely not! There are over 1700 parks, recreation centers, and play areas spread out all over the city. They\u2019re great if you want to exercise or even just spend some time in nature, away from all your screens!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"23-when-is-the-best-time-to-move-to-nyc\">When Is The Best Time To Move To NYC?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to actually shifting, when should you move? Ideally, you want to move when rent is cheapest. The best time to move to NYC is in the tourist off-season \u2013 which is from October to February. This also coincides perfectly with the winter season in the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"24-why-are-there-lower-rent-prices-at-these-times\">Why Are There Lower Rent Prices At These Times?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is this the case, you may be wondering? Here\u2019s a look at the most common reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"25-unfavorable-weather-conditions-\"><strong>Unfavorable Weather Conditions<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:59%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/4L69OKSHdCx7a\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/4L69OKSHdCx7a\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Winters in NYC can get pretty brutal with a lot of snow. This means not a lot of tourists want to visit, and even those moving here want to wait until it\u2019s a little warmer. If you brave the cold, you\u2019re almost certain to get a good apartment for a much cheaper rate. In fact, prices start going down in October and are at their lowest in February.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"26-fewer-people-house-hunting-\"><strong>Fewer People House Hunting<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There are fewer people looking for rental properties. This is partly because the weather is bad. But also, this period is when internships and summer jobs come to an end, leaving a lot of places empty. Whether you\u2019re a student or a professional, renting in NYC is more budget-friendly if you sign your lease in the winter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"27-whats-the-average-cost-of-living-in-nyc\">What&#8217;s The Average Cost Of Living In NYC?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re planning your budget for living in NYC, there are a number of factors for you to keep in mind &#8211; average rent, food and entertainment, and traveling. With a monthly budget planned, it\u2019ll be easier for you to see if you&#8217;re making enough.

The <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/new-york-city-rent\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">average rent in NYC<\/a> differs from one to the other and quite significantly so. For instance, the average rent in Staten Island is $1518 a month, but in Manhattan, it goes all the way up to a whopping $4045! But, in all of these places, you can save on rent if you have roommates to share the cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"29-cost-of-living-and-budgeting\">Cost of Living and Budgeting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to know what moving to NYC looks like in terms of renting and budgeting. In most rental agreements, you will find that the majority of your utilities are covered in the monthly rent. The only extras you&#8217;ll need are gas and electricity. For these, you can expect to shell out about $50 a month. If that sounds a bit steep to you, you might want to consider getting a roommate or two to be able to split the cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, for your internet and phone bills, you can budget about $100 \u2013 30% for the internet and the rest for your phone. Lastly, food costs. Living in New York, grocery shopping should only cost you about $300 a month, if you budget well. But, if you enjoy eating out and experimenting with different restaurants, a good three-course meal for two will cost about $100 on its own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"30-traveling-in-nyc\">Traveling in NYC<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Public transit in NYC is a great way to travel fast and cheaply.
