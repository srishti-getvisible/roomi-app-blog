You have a financial goal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has goals, but any sizeable investment will have a big impact on your finances and lifestyle. Big goals typically require some professional help. One also needs to know whether they are making the right choices with such broad investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. You get a fat tax refund every year<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be happy to get that tax refund check every April, but a tax advisor will tell you that it&#8217;s not fitting to leave your hard-earned money in the hands of uncle Sam, with no interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. You just tied the knot<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Responsibility for two lives is quite different from just one. There are some complex questions to think about. What happens to individual debts? Should you combine accounts? What&#8217;s the best manner to file taxes? A financial advisor will help you navigate through the best solutions for you and your beau.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. You&#8217;ve started a new business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be very risky to start a business without professional advice. You&#8217;ll be busy focusing on the company, so consider outsourcing other important elements such as budgeting, cash flow, capital sourcing and taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"688\" data-attachment-id=\"8863\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/10-signs-you-need-a-financial-advisor-roomi\/attachment\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing.jpg?fit=1920%2C1290&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1290\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing.jpg?fit=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing.jpg?fit=1024%2C688&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a man reading a newspaper \" class=\"wp-image-8863\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing.jpg?resize=1024%2C688&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing.jpg?resize=300%2C202&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing.jpg?resize=768%2C516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing.jpg?resize=1536%2C1032&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing.jpg?resize=1200%2C806&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/seek-financial-advise-when-you-start-investing.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. You are struggling to stick to your repayment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re struggling with multiple debts or faltering with your savings plan, it is time to make an appointment with a financial advisor.
