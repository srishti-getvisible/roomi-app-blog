You and your roommate are <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/roommate-bonding-activities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">getting along great<\/a> and making plans left and right. You\u2019ll watch Netflix together, go to the gym together, and cook together! Then you remember: You co live with a vegan roommate or a vegetarian roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you freak out about giving up your meat and leather goods, take a step back. These days it\u2019s&nbsp;not uncommon to co live&nbsp;with someone whose lifestyle is drastically different to yours. Veganism has gained immense popularity over the last few years. So if you find&nbsp;yourself trying to balance a delicate carnivore\/herbivore relationship with your vegan roommate, don\u2019t worry! You\u2019re not alone. We talked to the experts for some&nbsp;tips on living with a vegan roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Get the facts right about your vegan roommate <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.vegan.com\/what\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vegan<\/a>&nbsp;is someone who avoids consuming or buying animal products. This includes animal flesh (red meat, chicken, fish), dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese, butter), eggs. And other animal-derived products (fur, wool, leather, fish oil, honey, etc.). Some vegans are more strict than others. But you should find out what your vegan roommate or vegetarian roommate personally avoids eating or drinking. And make sure you ask how they feel about cross-contamination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s pretty clear that animals are non-vegan, there can be things hiding in foods, such as broth, milk, cream, cheese and butter,\u201d says&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/sharonpalmer.com\/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sharon Palmer<\/a>, a&nbsp;registered dietitian and plant-based nutrition expert and author.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cChoose a margarine brand that is dairy-free. Use egg-free mayo and salad dressings, and breads that are vegan. You can also try soy or almond milk instead of dairy milk if you are worried about sharing food.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Many vegans also have strong beliefs about harming animals in any way. So pest control can become a conflict in a co-living situation with a vegan roommate. New York City tenant Lauren Paulauskas experienced this first-hand with her vegan roommate. She suggests addressing pest control and lifestyle beliefs during initial roommate discussions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cYou should be on the same page when it comes to how you will get rid of mice, cockroaches, etc.,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had a period when we had mice. And she had to be okay with us choosing to protect the food we purchased over the mice\u2019s lives,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Be&nbsp;open minded<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re living with a vegan roommate or a vegetarian roommate with different beliefs, it\u2019s important both parties are willing to be&nbsp;flexible to each other\u2019s lifestyle choices, even if they change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI had already begun living with my future wife before I made the decision to turn vegan,\u201d says&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pvptowers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">Paul Tower<\/a>, a triathlete and tech entrepreneur. \u201cSo it&nbsp;came as quite a shock to my friends and family.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As as result of his own experience, he&nbsp;stresses the importance of allowing time for someone to adjust,&nbsp;no matter what side of the issue you\u2019re on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t jump in and start making tofu burgers for your roommate on day one,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile you may be extremely interested to try out the new tofu and mayonnaise recipe you discovered, they probably won\u2019t be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOver time, however, you\u2019ll find that they\u2019ll start sharing meals or asking to try things. If you want to find food that is easy to bond over, try some great vegan cookies or chocolate. Hardly anyone can turn down a chocolate cookie, whether it\u2019s vegan or not.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"11900\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/can-co-live-happily-vegan-roommate\/attachment\/vegan-roommate-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/vegan-roommate.jpeg?fit=1051%2C701&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1051,701\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"vegan-roommate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/vegan-roommate.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/vegan-roommate.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/vegan-roommate.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"2 bowls of oatmeal and fruits with a pot and a cup of coffee\" class=\"wp-image-11900\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/vegan-roommate.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/vegan-roommate.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/vegan-roommate.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/vegan-roommate.jpeg?w=1051&amp;ssl=1 1051w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Have a system for living with your vegan roommate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you begin living with a vegan roommate or a vegetarian roommate, be sure to define expectations for the relationship. Will you be cooking together? What things will you share? What will you keep separate? One easy fix many cohabiters suggest is having two sets of all kitchen utensils.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThere was an unfortunate evening when my roommate got sick because a pan hadn\u2019t been cleaned very well after cooking meat,\u201d Ysmay Walsh, founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.42yogis.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">42 Yogis<\/a>, recalls. \u201cTo ensure it didn\u2019t happen again, we went out and bought another set of cookware and another set of dishes.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Though she\u2019s the vegan roommate now, having been the meat-eating roommate previously gives Ysmay particular insight into vegan\/non-vegan living, and she promises that it can be done with some planning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cWe would each have a shelf of the kitchen, with meat on the very bottom. That meant the vegetable crisper was used for beverages and products in sealed containers instead of vegetables so they would not be contaminated should the meat package leak,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe also each had a separate time to cook \u2014 first him, then me, so that nothing became contaminated while we were moving around.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cPlenty of things you eat on a day-to-day basis are vegan, and numerous dinners can easily become vegan without too much effort. My wife comes from an Italian background and many of their soups, pastas and bean dishes are vegan to begin with.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Be respectful <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re cooking meals together or not, the most important thing is to be considerate of the other person\u2019s choices when you live with a vegan roommate. Everyone wants to feel supported and comfortable in their own home, so simply listening and respecting someone\u2019s decisions \u2014 even if they\u2019re different to yours \u2014 can go a long way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cOne of the most important things when you&#8217;re a vegan is to feel that there is a sense of community. And that people are being understood and that people \u2018get\u2019 you,\u201d Palmer advises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo, being understanding and supportive of your roommate is a wonderful thing you can do.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers live happily with a vegan roommate?
