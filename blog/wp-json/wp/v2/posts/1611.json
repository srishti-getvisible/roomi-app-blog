Then think about the parts of your experience that could prove to be relevant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk about how you reached your current work position and company, your ambitions when you were in college, and whether they are different now. This is a very common interview question where they seek to hear about your personal life experiences or reasons for gaps in your resume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Question 2: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/6IOlC78q5MHhC\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/the-office-summer-hot-dog-6IOlC78q5MHhC?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Talk about your long-term goals with the company, what you intend to do while you work for the position offered to you, and how it will be relevant to your future goals. Moreover, be sincere and honest during the interview. If lying on the beach is where you see yourself in 5 years, tell them it would be on a business trip as a reward for the excellent job you would do!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Question 3: Why are you leaving your current job?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/XomTLpclNjd1S\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/L0IU2cW8sFw8V2UIfP?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fblog2.roomiapp.com%2F\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>First things first: If you were let go, it&#8217;s completely OKAY to admit it (especially now, with COVID-19 disrupting job sectors). Mention what didn&#8217;t work out and how you&#8217;ve been working hard to improve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&#8217;re leaving your current job, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/4-tips-to-stop-hating-your-job-all-the-time-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DO NOT shine a negative light on your job<\/a>, employer, or colleagues. The interviewer is not your colleague or friend. Instead, you could say things like: your ideas and goals do not match with your current company\/employer\/projects. Don&#8217;t miss the opportunity during a job interview to talk about how you wish to explore new skills and opportunities to develop a more versatile portfolio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you waiting to hear back after an interview? <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/do-this-while-you-wait-to-hear-from-a-job-interview-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here&#8217;s what you can do in the meantime!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Question 4: Why should we hire you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/4Fh0B2CCaickE\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/4Fh0B2CCaickE?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Remember that an interview is always a two-way street. So, list down your positive attributes that would benefit your employer. Then tell them about how YOU would benefit from the position.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Question 5: What are your strengths and weaknesses?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/egSqD74685gzK\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/egSqD74685gzK?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fingilizce.org%2F\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>To tackle this trick question, frame your answer in a way that does not oversell or undersell your qualities as an employee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of a quality that you honestly consider to be your <strong>weakness<\/strong> and add how you&#8217;re working to improve the said weakness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, when it comes to your <strong>strengths<\/strong>, do not try to oversell. Think of something that caters to the needs of the position. Also, support your answers to tricky job interview questions with relevant and brief examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/turn-any-job-into-your-dream-job-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How To Turn Any Job Into Your Dream Job<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Question 6: Do you have any questions for me?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/d1E1YlkOTe4IfdNC\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/latenightseth-question-seth-meyers-d1E1YlkOTe4IfdNC?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fpwcs.instructure.com%2Fcourses%2F176740%2Fdiscussion_topics%2F1780105\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>This is an opportunity for you to investigate. Don&#8217;t let it go. Moreover, this is a common interview question they expect an answer for although it may seem otherwise!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how badly you want a job, you need to protect yourself from toxic work environments, abusive employers, and work hours. So make a good list of things you would like to know and ask the most important ones. Some of them could be about their work hours, their office culture, and how a typical workday might look for you when you start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can enquire about the position \u2013 whether it&#8217;s a new one; and, if it&#8217;s an old position, where did the previous employee move to, etc. You could also ask the interviewer how long they&#8217;ve worked there and their favorite thing about their work. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to end it with a hint of vengeance, ask them where they see the company in the next few years!
