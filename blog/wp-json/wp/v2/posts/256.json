Roomi may have helped you score some amazing NYC roommates but conflict has arisen, and even if you\u2019re not a fan of adulting, you\u2019re going to need to know how to resolve a roommate <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience\/\">fight<\/a>&#8211; without the sticky notes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Boundaries and house rules<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting boundaries and creating <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/4-things-include-roommate-agreement\/\">house rules<\/a> can be uncomfortable for someone you\u2019re just meeting, even life long friends struggle with this when choosing to cohabitate. But, it\u2019s a necessary awkward that pays off. It\u2019s important to create your rules and to be aware of others. When you hear knocking on your room door because your bass dropped one too many times-don\u2019t be surprised since \u201cNoise Level\u201d is number 7 of the house rules. Honor NYC roommate rules and hold each other accountable. Keep house rules in a public area so all roommates have access and as a reminder. <a href=\"http:\/\/emilypost.com\/advice\/roommates-establishing-house-rules\/\">Here you can find tip<\/a>s on where to begin when creating house rules and boundaries with NYC roommates.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/iB4PoTVka0Xnul7UaC\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/iB4PoTVka0Xnul7UaC\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>You had a fight with your roommate about Timing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200bYou woke up late and your can of Axe was empty- not only did your boss yell at you but you smell. It\u2019s been an all round bad day. Coming home and seeing the same red pot in the sink for the 3rd day in a row has broken the camel\u2019s back and suddenly it\u2019s HulkMania in Apt 102. Before your living room reaches WWE status, consider whether the timing of the confrontation is appropriate and you are not fueled by misdirected stress. The sooner you address the issue, the better it is. In the event that you do blow-off steam whilst confronting a roommate issue, quickly and sincerely apologize for it. Anger charged discussions accomplish nothing and you\u2019ll end up washing the dishes out of guilt anyway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Face to face communication<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Roommate Facebook pages, group chat\/text, and dry erase boards are all modern day platforms for asking NYC roommates to supply their share of toilet paper. When it comes to resolving a fight, discussing broken rules, or confrontation it should be done face to face with all roommates present. Often times what is said in text can be misconstrued. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not yelling at you, I\u2019m just really excited about toilet paper\u201d. Avoid THAT <a href=\"https:\/\/climb.pcc.edu\/blog\/the-7-benefits-of-effective-communication-in-personal-and-professional-settings\">conversation<\/a> by talking to each other more often. The environment of the discussion should feel safe and no single roommate attacked by the rest. So, to effectively resolve a NYC roommate fight, lose the emoji\u2019s and call for a house meeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/lrVv9x04e0WzHGmkpF\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/lrVv9x04e0WzHGmkpF\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to fight fair\u200b with your roommate<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cmhc.utexas.edu\/fightingfair.html\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fighting rules<\/a> with roommates are the same ones you apply to a fight with anyone else.
