Bananas and peanut butter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple and healthy! Bananas are packed with healthy nutrients, such as potassium and fiber. Bananas require no meal prep, just grab one and go! Add peanut butter to your healthy snack for added protein as it\u2019ll keep you satisfied for longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also try other fruits paired with peanut butter for a delicious healthy snack option, and apples and strawberries are our go-to! They&#8217;re high in fiber and vitamin C and will satisfy your sweet tooth when you\u2019re craving a sweet snack. Quick, easy, and tasty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Oatmeal<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best classic healthy snacks that never gets old. Oatmeal is a great little healthy snack idea as well as a nutritious breakfast meal. Not only is oatmeal inexpensive, it\u2019s good for you too! This healthy snack is high in fiber and will keep you fuller for longer. Simply mix it with your favorite milk and put it in the microwave to prepare it quickly, and top it with your favorite fruit and granola. Voil\u00e0, the perfect healthy snack recipe!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re running low on time, try overnight oats! Overnight oats are one of increasingly popular healthy snack ideas, and you can even mix in protein powder to add flavor and increase your protein intake. Just like warm oats, mix your ingredients together in a container, but this time keep them in the fridge overnight. Take them out the next day for a tasty ready-to-eat healthy snack recipe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Bell peppers and cheese<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most awesome savory healthy snacks! Bell peppers are a fantastic vegetable high in vitamin C and fiber. Simply grab your favorite kind of bell pepper, slice it in half, then cover it with your favorite cheese (cream cheese is definitely our favorite!). Finish with seasoning and enjoy this savory healthy snack recipe that will keep you full, satisfied&#8230; and happy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"9510\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/cheap-and-healthy-snack-ideas-roomi\/attachment\/healthy-snack-ideas\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/healthy-snack-ideas.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"683,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"healthy-snack-ideas\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/healthy-snack-ideas.jpg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/healthy-snack-ideas.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/healthy-snack-ideas.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bell peppers and cream cheese as a healthy snack idea\" class=\"wp-image-9510\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/healthy-snack-ideas.jpg?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/healthy-snack-ideas.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Healthy snack idea: Trail mix<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s one of the simplest healthy snack ideas. Instead of buying premixed trail mix, make your own! Pick out your favorite nuts and dried fruit, then mix together and enjoy the goodness! Trail mix is a perfect healthy snack for work or to bring on the go when you&#8217;re travelling. It\u2019s quick, easy and will keep you full as far as snacks go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Carrots and hummus<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a chips and dip lover? Then this healthy snack idea is for you! If you\u2019re looking for a healthier and cheaper option than chips and dip, carrots and hummus is the perfect choice for a healthy snack. Carrots are packed with vitamins and fiber, while hummus is just delicious! So pick out your favorite hummus and pair with carrots to satisfy your urge to snack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Healthy snack idea: Popcorn<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Craving carbs? Try popcorn! Not only is popcorn inexpensive, but it&#8217;s much lower in calories than chips. It\u2019s also super easy to make at home!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buy your favorite popcorn kernels and place them in a paper lunch bag. Fold the top down and place in the microwave. And once you start hearing pops, your popcorn is being made! Top your popcorn with salt and olive oil for a healthy snack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find healthy snack ideas?
