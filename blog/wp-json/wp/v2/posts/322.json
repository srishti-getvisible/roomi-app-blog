Getting a roommate in NYC will affect your life, finances, sleep cycles, and general state of sanity in every way. Finding a roommate is make-or-break material, and should be treated with the same level of care you approach a car loan.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever confronted with a massive project with lots of moving parts, it helps to break it down into small, manageable pieces that can be tackled one at a time. This tactic significantly reduces the panic factor when we realize we need to uproot and transplant our entire existence in less than a month. So here is a list of smaller questions you can use to answer the looming issue of \u201cShould I get a roommate in NYC?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>3 Questions To Ask Yourself Before You Find A Roommate in NYC<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Are you getting a roommate for the sole purpose of saving money?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s probably reason number one on the list for most people. NYC is a wealth of opportunity and excitement and priced to match. If saving money is a goal for you, then you\u2019re probably feeling financial stress like 99.9% of the rest of the world. But keep in mind that saving money is the symptom. The root cause is stress. So be really choosy when finding a roommate to make sure this person is going to reduce your stress, and not add to it. If you don\u2019t, then saving money won\u2019t have accomplished your underlying goal, which is to lead a happier, healthier life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Are there other ways to save money?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you write down everything you spend money on? I know. Ick. The mere thought of typing every expense into your phone is enough to instigate a small gag reflex. But, is the inconvenience stopping you? Or are you a leery of what you might find?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are so many carefree ways to pay. Swipe a card, wave a phone, and pay online through PayPal. It\u2019s easy to lose track of it all. Which is precisely why it\u2019s so important to get every expense written down so you can see where your money is going. Coffee at Starbucks twice a day? Going out for drinks thrice a week? Those little expenses add up faster than we realize with so many convenient ways to pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t be surprised if the money you could save by having a roommate could be saved with less stress by getting a studio apartment and dropping, or at least reducing unnecessary expenses.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Are there other ways to reduce stress?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, let\u2019s say you got your budget under control, or you\u2019re one of those rare people who can balance a bank account through secret ninja techniques passed down through your family for generations. (Which qualifies as a superpower, by the way, so props to you.) If stress is still driving you into the arms of a roommate, take a step back before you commit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you hate your job? Some workplaces are just toxic. Long hours, low pay, and enough workplace politics to fuel fifty reality TV shows. If you are losing sleep over your workload, finding a job that pays the same but sucks way less is a logical step to go through before finding a roommate in NYC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check other sources of stress. Relationship dragging you down? Maybe it\u2019s time to break it off and move on. Is your apartment really loud? Do you have a better chance of winning the lottery than parking within a mile of your own home? Finding a new apartment first might do more for your stress levels than finding a roommate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your affairs are in order, you very well may still want to find a roommate in NYC or even a new base of operations. With the right tools you can find an excellent roommate who adds to your life, not your stress load.
