And that means those hot showers are about to become that much more important to get you through the days.

And when you\u2019re paying an arm and a leg to <i>rent<\/i> your home, it\u2019s that much more important that you get your money\u2019s worth. Having hot water is a fundamental right due to renters by their landlords, so if your taps are running cold, it\u2019s important to speak up. But if you&#8217;re going to confront your landlord, it&#8217;s important to be aware of tenants&#8217; rights. So what do you do if a landlord isn\u2019t providing the essentials, like hot water? What are your rights as a tenant under law?<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/ZeKsFg68oVii3m0EJc\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/ZeKsFg68oVii3m0EJc\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-your-landlord-have-to-provide-hot-water\">Does Your Landlord Have to Provide Hot Water?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tenants-rights-in-new-york-city\">Tenants&#8217; rights in New York City<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In New York City, every landlord is required to&nbsp;provide adequate heat and hot water between Oct. 1 and May 31 (also known as the \u201cHeat Season\u201d), <a href=\"http:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/hpd\/renters\/important-safety-issues-heat-hot-water.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to NYC 311<\/a>. Hot water, however, <a href=\"http:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/hpd\/renters\/important-safety-issues-heat-hot-water.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">should be provided 365 days a year<\/a> and should be at least 120\u00b0. If you\u2019re without either or both, you can report it to the City. Renters are also allowed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/5-things-to-do-if-you-cant-make-rent-roomi\/\">withhold rent<\/a> for such a grievance, according to Brooklyn-based <a href=\"http:\/\/streeteasy.com\/blog\/nyc-renters-rights-heat-hot-water\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">housing rights attorney Justin La Mort<\/a>. But don&#8217;t make that your first plant of action. NYC 311 recommends first contacting your landlord, managing agent or super to resolve the issue (remember to&nbsp;keep track of all written correspondence). If it still goes unresolved within a reasonable amount of time, let the City intervene on your behalf, recommends NYC realtor Collin Bond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cIf a tenant does not have hot water they should call 311 to file a complaint. This will trigger an investigation by the HPD (Housing Preservation &amp; Development). HPD will follow up with the owner or management company and the tenant to see if service has been restored.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If hot water <i>still<\/i> isn\u2019t restored, your landlord could be subject to some serious fines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThe penalty for not providing hot water is $250 to $500 per day for each initial violation,\u201d adds Bond, \u201cand $500 to $1,000 for each subsequent violation at the same building during the same or next calendar year from the initial violation.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If the&nbsp;situation forces you out of your apartment (because cold showers in 15\u00b0 weather is not OK), you still shouldn\u2019t try to withhold rent. If you incur expenses because of the situation (i.e. you\u2019re displaced and have to go to a hotel, etc.) make sure to keep all receipts, pay your rent, and seek legal counsel. Taking your landlord to court isn\u2019t the ideal situation, but it is your right if push comes to shove. To learn about all your rights as a tenant under law, visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/metcouncilonhousing.org\/help_and_answers\/statutory_rights_of_residential_tenants_in_new_york\">Metropolitan Council on Housing<\/a>&nbsp;website.  <\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:81%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/L2ZLZn70dUGGlmH9Pd\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/L2ZLZn70dUGGlmH9Pd\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tenants-rights-in-san-francisco\">Tenants&#8217; rights in San Francisco<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like NYC, San Francisco law requires that a landlord provide hot water to their tenants, as apart of their responsibility to maintain \u201chabitability\u201d of their residences. Heat should be available and maintained at 68\u00b0 between 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. or 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Hot water should always be available and maintained at a temperature of 105\u00b0 to 120\u00b0, according to SF311.&nbsp;If you\u2019re without hot water in San Francisco, you can technically withhold rent. But just like in NYC, you should never resort to this first. Going on a rent strike could put you a at risk of an eviction for not paying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cIf you use this option, the landlord may fix the problem or attempt to evict you for nonpayment of rent and you will have to go to court and adequately prove the seriousness of the problem and the landlord\u2019s failure to do anything about it,\u201d says the San Francisco Tenants Union website.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, report the issue to your landlord and document the correspondence. If your landlord doesn\u2019t fix your hot water in a timely manner, you should contact the<a href=\"http:\/\/sfdbi.org\/\"> Department of Building Inspection<\/a>. Expect the city to inspect within one business day. Continue documenting every correspondence, and ask for a copy of the report for your records. But be careful if you live in an illegal <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/nyc-landlords-never-empty-apartment\/\">apartment<\/a>. The DBI could shut down the apartment building altogether. That would lead to an automatic eviction. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can show the landlord knew of the issues and did not repair them in a timely manner, you can repair the damage yourself and deduct what you spent from your rent. But again, you risk an eviction notice based on nonpayment of rent, and you could end up in court. Therefore, it\u2019s not advised to do this, and you may be better off pursuing legal action. Ultimately, it\u2019s never a good idea to withhold rent until you\u2019ve spoken to a lawyer. Organizations like the San Francisco Tenants Union, Housing Rights Committee of SF and SF311 are great resources for more information and counsel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tenant-law-in-other-cities\">Tenant law in other cities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t live in NYC or SF? Your landlord still has to provide you hot water. Find your city\u2019s tenants&#8217; rights or housing authority website to learn what the laws are. You have rights as a tenant under law to live in a habitable environment . That means your landlord must do their part to provide it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers stay informed about tenants&#8217; rights?
