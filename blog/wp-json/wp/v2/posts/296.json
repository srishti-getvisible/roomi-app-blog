It is said becoming roommates with friends should be avoided to keep what they have. But let&#8217;s take a closer look at this strange phenomena to decide. Should you be moving in with your friend? There are three sides to every situation. Let&#8217;s consider the good, bad, and reality of living with a friend.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b><strong>Pros<\/strong><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> of moving in with your friend <\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No roommate hunt, no awkward first meetings, no roommate interviews.

Living with a friend can reduce stress exponentially. You always have someone near who not only knows you, but <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gets<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you. There comes a time among roommates where you need favors, or to borrow almond milk until you can make it to the store. Moving in with your friend makes the asking part that much easier. Living with a friend is comfortable and makes it twice as easy to maintain your traditional nights of Chinese takeout and Netflix originals. What is better than spring rolls and House of Cards&#8230;right?<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"12697\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/become-roommates-friend\/attachment\/roommates-with-friends-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1253&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1253\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"roommates-with-friends\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"one guy and two girls talking and laughing over a couple of beers\" class=\"wp-image-12697\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><b>Cons <\/b>of moving in with your friend<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, how the truest of colors will shine when moving in with your friend!

You walk the fine line of commitment over conflict. With a typical roommate, confrontation can be a lot easier to face. After all, you\u2019re not too concerned if a stranger likes you or not. With a friend, it can be tempting to withhold communication around an issue because you don\u2019t want to be another failed attempt at being roommates with a friend. But you\u2019ve watched your leftovers disappear one too many times, and things aren\u2019t looking so good anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"12698\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/become-roommates-friend\/attachment\/roommates-with-friends-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends-1.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1253&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1253\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"roommates-with-friends-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends-1.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"2 girls sitting side by side but looking away from each other\" class=\"wp-image-12698\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends-1.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommates-with-friends-1.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><b>The rea<\/b>lity of living with a friend<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reality of moving with your friend is you\u2019ll be fine.

At the very worst the friendship ends when the lease expires, and should that be the case maybe it wasn\u2019t the strongest of bonds anyway.
