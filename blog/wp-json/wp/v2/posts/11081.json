But alas, our budgets bring us back down to earth and force us to be realistic. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/hacks-to-help-you-find-the-perfect-apartment-in-nyc-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apartment rentals in NYC<\/a>, especially if it\u2019s on a monthly basis, are really expensive. So here\u2019s where you really need to sit down and ask yourself what it is that you really want. Yes, a Central Park facing apartment is really nice, but do you really need it? Similarly, if you\u2019re looking for short term apartments in New York for 3 or 4 months, it might be smart to invest in one that is fully furnished. Only you know the specifics of your situation, so make sure you do a cost\/benefit analysis before signing anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l2oZWp27osV3LZG94N\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l2oZWp27osV3LZG94N\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make sure you know the legalities before looking at short term rentals<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As short term vacation homes have become more <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/roomis-year-in-review-what-the-2020-room-rental-market-looked-like\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">popular<\/a>, there has been some serious backlash from residents. Especially in New York where several communities have passed ordinances that regulate short term rentals. So, for example, you have to lease apartment rentals in NYC on at least a monthly basis, not less than that. Make sure you know the rules and regulations of the building beforehand or may end up paying for it, literally. All of this confusion around regulations has led to an increase in <a href=\"https:\/\/streeteasy.com\/blog\/nyc-rental-scams\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">scams<\/a>, and you really don\u2019t want to get sucked into any of that. So, if you\u2019re looking for short term apartments in New York, make sure you are fully informed about the legal aspect of renting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Right place, right time<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may already know, New York City is one of the most expensive places to live in the world. Which means that short term rentals are going to be even more expensive than regular apartments. But the thing is, you might actually get a very good deal depending on what time of year it is. So, for example, during peak tourist season, the rent for short term apartments in New York are going to skyrocket. You may even find it hard to find an apartment in the neighborhood you want. In this case, you will really have to make compromises and make the best of the situation. But if you can time your trip right, you might just find a great apartment at a great price. So, you might want to factor that in if you\u2019re looking for apartment rentals in NYC on a monthly basis!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/8ZbiJa2wWlgHDjZo3p\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/8ZbiJa2wWlgHDjZo3p\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers look for good short term rentals in New York City?
