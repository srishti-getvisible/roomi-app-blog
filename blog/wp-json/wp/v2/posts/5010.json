As a student, moving out is hard enough. Renting an apartment in the midst of a pandemic can add to the challenge. You may wonder, do you need credit to rent an apartment?  How do you even begin searching for apartments for rent without being able to see them in person?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>University life in the States means looking forward to a path of learning and networking while also having fun and making memories. Unfortunately, this year we have attended more virtual meetings than <a label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/attentiv.com\/america-meets-a-lot\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">ever recorded<\/a>. This means that studying and working from home has become the new norm, but once school ends, you might be itching to fly the nest and find a place of your own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi offers some tips to find yourself the perfect cozy apartments for rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Renting an apartment: How to start your search!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has had a shifting effect on apartments for rent. For example, cities like Los Angeles, Miami, Seattle, and Houston have observed a <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.apartmentguide.com\/blog\/apartment-guide-annual-rent-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">decrease in rent<\/a> compared to New York City, New Orleans, and Phoenix. The ideal time to begin your search for your apartment is at the end of the month before the target move month. Make sure you check for things like, do you need credit to rent an apartment in a specific area?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might seem very last minute, but most renters have leases that terminate at the end of a month or within the first few days of the following month. It&#8217;s a great idea to connect with your classmates and find out if they&#8217;re looking for a place to rent near your campus, and you can start the search together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/how-coronavirus-affected-rental-market\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How Has Coronavirus Affected The Rental Market In New York?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Decide if you want roommates when renting an apartment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/9-reasons-why-living-with-a-roommate-is-awesome-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Having a roommate<\/a> can be a blessing, especially now that we&#8217;re limited to very little social interaction.
