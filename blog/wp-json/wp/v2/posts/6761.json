It\u2019s nearly impossible to describe the frustrating-wonderfulness that it is and it can be ridiculously difficult to deconstruct why some relationships work or why others are just not meant to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we are sure about, though, is that some common misconceptions have gotten way more credit than they deserve. In fact, we can all do without them, thank you very much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we pick four misconceptions that have no place in a healthy relationship:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Your #couplegoals need to be the same as everyone else\u2019s<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/655555289499609274\/\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-pinterest\">https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/655555289499609274\/<\/a>\n\n\n\n<p>Say you\u2019re scrolling through your feed and up pops a sweet photograph informing you that someone you know has just gotten engaged. Are you happy for them? Of course! But are you now also wondering if you should pop the question to your partner of 2 years?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should go ahead if you think you&#8217;re ready and feel it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. Be careful to not do it just because all your friends are doing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every relationship is different and goes at its own pace. In a healthy relationship, the pace is set by the people who are in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>\u2018Happily, ever after\u2019 means nothing ever goes wrong<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l0Ex3er7csRTcMz3q\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l0Ex3er7csRTcMz3q\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of misconceptions to clear up here. The first is that marriage automatically equals happiness. But if you\u2019re unhappy in your relationship, marriage doesn\u2019t automatically make things better. Actually. it often exacerbates problems that already exist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, marriage is often treated as the \u2018end goal\u2019 of a relationship. In fact, there&#8217;s so much more that happens <em>after <\/em>the wedding &#8211; maybe kids, career growth, retirement etc. Life brings with it an array of joys and challenges, whether there\u2019s a ring on your finger or not. Having a committed partner by your side can help in facing those life challenges better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><a href=\"La La Land&#039;s Important Lesson About Not Regretting Love\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Related: La La Land's Important Lesson About Not Regretting Love<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Relationships should always stay the same<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/LnpwNx7ETVFqE\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/LnpwNx7ETVFqE\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Isn\u2019t it human nature to grow and evolve? Both you and your partner are bound to change as the years roll by. To keep up, a healthy relationship will grow and adapt as well. Your honeymoon phase will not last forever, but that\u2019s not a bad thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguments are sometimes looked at as \u2018failures\u2019 in relationships; constructive disagreements can be a healthier form of communication. During a disagreement, let go of trying to prove \u2018I\u2019m right\u2019 and attempt to learn something new about your partner. Ultimately, this strengthens relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Being in love, in a relationship will make you happy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/9640586682907927\/\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-pinterest\">https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/9640586682907927\/<\/a>\n\n\n\n<p>Being in a relationship makes life more colorful and adds a certain glow to it. But your general state of happiness ultimately lies in your own hands. Giving someone else the responsibility to make you happy is really a big ask. If you\u2019re dependent on being in a relationship to be happy, you will likely fall into traps of insecurity and jealousy. Which, in turn, puts a strain on your relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/30-quotes-about-loving-yourself-roomi\/1872\/page-not-found\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">30 Beautiful Quotes &amp; Affirmations On Self Love To Start Your Day Right<\/a><\/strong><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter who we are or where we are in life, it\u2019s important to remember that in a healthy relationship, there\u2019s no winning or losing.
