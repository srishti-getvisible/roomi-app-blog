A dream place to live in with raging rental prices that are no less than&nbsp;a nightmare. Folks, this is that place where money flies right outta your pocket. With rental prices as high as $12,000, most people moving to NYC, don\u2019t prefer to stay in Manhattan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But contrary to popular belief, living in NYC is expensive but not unaffordable. The trick is to manage your finances, learn to budget, and use our tips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-is-living-in-nyc-so-darn-expensive-anyway\">Why is living in NYC so darn expensive, anyway?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Living in NYC can be tough on the wallet, there&#8217;s no denying it. But there&#8217;s more to the high cost of living than meets the eye. When you live in the Big Apple, you&#8217;re paying for more than just a cramped apartment and an overpriced cup of coffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main reasons living in NYC is so expensive is due to the high demand for limited space. It&#8217;s no secret that New York City is one of the most crowded cities in the world. With millions of people vying for the same small slice of real estate, prices are naturally going to skyrocket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not all bad news! Living in NYC also comes with a ton of perks that make the high cost worth it for many. From world-class dining and entertainment to unbeatable career opportunities, there&#8217;s always something exciting happening in the city that never sleeps. And let&#8217;s not forget about the incredible cultural diversity and vibrant communities that make NYC such a unique place to live.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while the price tag may be hefty, living in NYC is an investment in experiences that you simply can&#8217;t find anywhere else. And who knows, with a little bit of luck and determination, you might just find that the rewards of living in the Big Apple far outweigh the costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-find-cheap-apartments-in-new-york-tips-and-tricks\">How to Find Cheap Apartments in New York: Tips and Tricks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"731\" data-attachment-id=\"20986\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/how-to-find-cheap-apartments-in-new-york-manhattan-edition\/attachment\/how-to-find-cheap-apartments-in-new-york-tips-and-tricks\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/How-to-Find-Cheap-Apartments-in-New-York-Tips-and-Tricks.png?fit=1624%2C1160&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1624,1160\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"How to Find Cheap Apartments in New York Tips and Tricks\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/How-to-Find-Cheap-Apartments-in-New-York-Tips-and-Tricks.png?fit=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/How-to-Find-Cheap-Apartments-in-New-York-Tips-and-Tricks.png?fit=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/How-to-Find-Cheap-Apartments-in-New-York-Tips-and-Tricks.png?resize=1024%2C731&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"How to Find Cheap Apartments in New York Tips and Tricks\" class=\"wp-image-20986\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/How-to-Find-Cheap-Apartments-in-New-York-Tips-and-Tricks.png?resize=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/How-to-Find-Cheap-Apartments-in-New-York-Tips-and-Tricks.png?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/How-to-Find-Cheap-Apartments-in-New-York-Tips-and-Tricks.png?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/How-to-Find-Cheap-Apartments-in-New-York-Tips-and-Tricks.png?resize=1536%2C1097&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/How-to-Find-Cheap-Apartments-in-New-York-Tips-and-Tricks.png?resize=1250%2C893&amp;ssl=1 1250w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/How-to-Find-Cheap-Apartments-in-New-York-Tips-and-Tricks.png?w=1624&amp;ssl=1 1624w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/city-with-high-rise-building-during-daytime-YPcVXzI3_DM\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding an affordable apartment in New York can feel like an insurmountable task, especially in a city known for its high cost of living. However, with a little creativity and perseverance, it&#8217;s possible to find a hidden gem that won&#8217;t break the bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Find roommates<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people living in NYC save tons of money by staying with roommates. Even more so in Manhattan where rentals start from $1000 for a 1BHK (Bedroom, Hall, and Kitchen) or a studio apartment! Getting a roommate not only means cheap rental, but it also helps you cut down costs like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>50% of brokerage + Security deposit (which is a LOT!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Utility bills: water, electricity, maintenance, etc<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Groceries<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>50% of additional costs like wear-&amp;-tear, home improvement, furnishings, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If it\u2019s your first time moving to NYC, we recommend roommates or a co-living space. They&#8217;ll help you get acquainted with the city and help you save tons of money for the fun stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you find roommates, use <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Roomi<\/a>, the ultimate roommate finder app. You can find roommates who match your living style and preferences (making your living situation easier in the future!).

Winter is the best time to find cheap apartments in New York!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer is the most preferred season by people living in NYC. It&#8217;s all about pleasant weather, busy streets, and the opening of college admissions. Hence, students worldwide come to NYC for internships and college programs. Resulting in super competitive rentals and difficulty in finding your dream apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in winter, most students move out, leaving an array of options for a renter like you. You&#8217;ll also find landlords willing to negotiate and cut you a better deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/guide-to-renting-cheap-apartments-in-new-york-roomi\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Guide To Renting Affordable Housing In New York Amid The Pandemic<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.
