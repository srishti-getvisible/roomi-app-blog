You dismiss it as a phone call, but then you start to hear screaming or someone walking around the house, and you&#8217;re frozen under the covers not because it&#8217;s cold but because you are scared, only to find out that your roommate has been sleepwalking!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halloween season or not, if someone is carrying out everyday activities with eyes wide open, while their brain is basically asleep, it is challenging for the sleepwalker and the people living with the sleepwalker. Although it&#8217;s a rare condition in adulthood (a mere 4% of the population) and most people grow out of it once they hit puberty, &#8220;somnambulism&#8221; (or sleepwalking) in adults is not unheard of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The kind of behavior carried out during sleepwalking ranges from sitting up on the bed, talking and rummaging through the cupboards, eating, to walking out of the house and driving to kill their mother-in-law <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/archives\/la-xpm-1988-05-28-mn-3400-story.html#:~:text=A%20man%20was%20acquitted%20of,Pickering%2C%20not%20guilty%20on%20Thursday.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(true story)<\/a>. The behavior and the sleepwalking process itself is terrifying and still a mystery to scientists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a sleepwalking roomi, being creeped out on more occasions than one is justified but not helpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here are some ways you can deal with a sleepwalking roomi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Be gentle when your roommate is sleepwalking<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/26Ff7aFM4pSgyvy1i\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/heyarnold-hey-arnold-nicksplat-26Ff7aFM4pSgyvy1i\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Maybe the first time you saw your roomi carry out activities while sleeping creeped you out, and you wanted to scream, rattle them, and wake them up so they can return to their usual selves. But science says that&#8217;s not the right way to deal with a sleepwalker, as the sudden shock might make them violent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/5-ways-get-better-sleep-noisy-city-apartment\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">5 Ways to Get Better Sleep in a Noisy City Apartment(Opens in a new browser tab)<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your sleepwalking roomi is somewhere they shouldn&#8217;t be (maybe standing at the edge of your bed, talking to an invisible spirit over your head), do not scream. Instead, try talking back to them in a gentle voice, and slowly guide them to their bed, putting them to sleep again. Think of yourself as a powerful hypnotist who can make people do whatever they want, using your powers for good to put your roomi to sleep again!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.

Locking your roomis up in their room could be a bit extreme, but if they have a history of indulging in activities that might be harmful to them as well as to other roomis while sleepwalking, you could try it out if your sleepwalking roomi is willing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Know the preventative measures for when your roommate is sleepwalking <\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l4Ep3wOSDAgwWC7D2\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/heyarnold-hey-arnold-nicksplat-l4Ep3wOSDAgwWC7D2\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>The thing with sleepwalking is it affects you as much as &#8211; or even more than &#8211; it affects the sleepwalker.

The fact remains that sleepwalking is a mysterious, yet fascinating health condition that could be caused by underlying concerns. Shaming or ostracising them for a condition that they cannot control won&#8217;t lead to any good and might sever your relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-declutter-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">How to Declutter When you Share an Apartment<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if your roomi&#8217;s sleepwalking habits are repetitive and bothersome, have a conversation with them about visiting a doctor or moving in with their parents till they can put in better ways to control it. It might even be funny sometimes, but if not taken care of, sleepwalking can pose many dangers to the sleepwalker and the people around them. So make sure you deal with a situation like this with empathy and make them feel loved even if they&#8217;re snatching sweet sleep away from you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers figure out the best approach to things if their roommate is sleepwalking?
