But while many singles, couples, and even families with children have been diving into tiny living with open arms. Whether to create a more intimate family environment or to save up for other big-ticket expenses. But many urban dwellers are forced into the situation by way of their small city spaces. But it doesn\u2019t have to be all that bad. Here are our favorite interior design tips to living large, literally!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you turn your nose up at small living, you might be surprised at some ingenious ways you can make even a 400-square-foot apartment look good (starting with our favorite DIY design tips <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/8-gorgeous-diy-projects-to-open-up-your-small-living-space\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">here<\/a>). So don\u2019t cry a river over small-living, take inspiration from these tiny house owners who will have you livin\u2019 large in no time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Interior design tips that go beyond custom building your furniture.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1586105251261-72a756497a11?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" alt=\"black and white bed linen that utilize interior design tips to make a small home look proportionally aesthetic\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of DIY furniture probably seems daunting, but it\u2019s worth it when store-bought pieces take up too much space. Tiny house owner and writer Melissa Dohmen and her fianc\u00e9 Carson Vaughan came across this issue in their 120-square-foot camper. So they decided to build almost every piece of furniture they own. Now that&#8217;s the kind of design tips we love!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cFurniture becomes clunky or impractical when it\u2019s not relevant to your personal habits,\u201d Dohmen says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo we built pieces we knew we\u2019d use and built them to our own specifications. For example, we both needed a desk to write on, but we don\u2019t often store things on our desk when not using it. So, to save that space when we\u2019re not writing, we built the desk with hinges so that it could fold down and flat against the wall when not in use.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogger Kim Kasl, who also lives in a tiny home with her family, notes that while they \u201chave a great lack of furniture,\u201d they were able to make their own bookshelf to fit their specific needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe shelving we have \u2014 it can\u2019t be a shelf that has too much depth because it intrudes on the space if it\u2019s too big,\u201d Kasl says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Kasl\u2019s family shares the laundry bin, a custom-built piece her husband made that\u2019s stored on the porch and disguised thanks to its beautiful, wooden exterior. How\u2019s that for creativity?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Always take advantage of that wall!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it might require a little extra work, taking advantage of your walls will really transform your apartment without taking up floor space. Sure, it might be easier to simply place a bookshelf on the ground rather than mounting one on the wall, but it\u2019s a waste of precious space in a small home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cWith interior design that is appealing, open storage is key,\u201d says Tenecia Harris, an interior designer whose work has been featured on HGTV and Travel Channel. \u201cClosed storage only encloses a room and makes it feel like the walls are closing in. Open storage (hooks, shelves, pegs) allows you to see where the walls are and give more depth. If you can also wall mount collectibles, it\u2019s artwork and storage in one.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dohmen and Vaughan make use of design tips like this in their kitchen, a room that is easily prone to clutter no matter what size. To ensure things aren\u2019t left out on the counters they use magnets to organize \u201ceverything from our kitchen knives and scissors to spice containers that stick to the side of our oven hood,\u201d according to Dohmen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kasl makes the most of her wall space by using hooks \u2014 and not always in the conventional sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThere are hooks everywhere,\u201d Kasl says. \u201cOur hooks hold clothes, necklaces, jackets. I hang scissors on the hooks. One holds the fish tank. The tank is almost like a cookie jar with a handle, and the handle hooks onto the wall hook. Vertical space is so important.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Before implying any of our design tips, remember, smaller pieces are not always better!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Clunky furniture can often overwhelm an already cramped space, leading many renters and homeowners to assume that smaller furniture is the best solution.&nbsp;But that\u2019s not always the case either, according to these experts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cChoosing small furniture is the biggest mistake most people make,\u201d Harris says. \u201cThe thinking is generally small furniture allows for more \u2018space\u2019 around the pieces. While you would think large furniture will make a space feel small, small furniture emphasizes just how tiny a place can be. Our eyes read the negative space created by the small furniture, and it just seems off. Ultimately the same rule applies to a small space as a large one: Proportion is king.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when it comes to decor and home goods, don\u2019t feel obligated to go large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cWe have all the dishes we own in one drawer,\u201d Kasl says. \u201cWe only keep four of everything and we don\u2019t have big plates, just the small ones.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Breaking away from traditional interior design rules.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you live in a one-bedroom apartment, an apartment with a loft, or even a studio, finding ways to be creative is important. While there may not be a separate room for the office you\u2019ve always dreamed of, or your bedroom shares the same space as your kitchen and living room, there\u2019s an easy fix. For instance, if you don\u2019t have a dedicated space for a home office, Harris recommends using non-traditional office pieces that will still give you what you want but create a unified appearance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA console table for a desk, an accent chair instead of a rolling chair,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWith today\u2019s technology, the printer can be in a closet instead of out. Ultimately the key to making a small space feel large is to continually emphasize the depth of the space. Lighting and mirrors are tricks of the trade to create depth. Additionally, seeing the wall space behind furniture is a simple way anyone can maximize their visual.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to this, Dohmen uses her bed area as a dining room when inviting company over for dinner. This creates two spaces in one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d simply need to fold up the bedding, fold up the table underneath. Then rearrange the cushions to have a full functioning dinner table setup,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Interior design for the multi-use lover: DIY or purchase multipurpose items!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you can\u2019t have everything you want in a tiny home. Whether that means sacrificing a full dining set and resorting to roommate dinners on the couch, you\u2019ll have to relinquish some of the luxuries a large space typically provides. While you can\u2019t have it all, finding furniture with multiple uses will help maximize your options. In their tiny home, Dohmen and her fianc\u00e9 have a floor cabinet they use as storage for books and their printer, while also hiding the trailer\u2019s wheel well. Additionally, the top of the cabinet can be used as a kitchen counter for cooking preparation and as an office workspace of sorts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe bottom drawer in our kitchen also pulls out into an eating area for our dog, Costello,\u201d Dohmen says. \u201cThe back (or front, in our case) of the bathroom door doubles as an organizer and hat rack. We added a copper bar and some S-rings that we use to hang our calendars, hats, light jackets, etcetera. We added a chalkboard sticker underneath it to write reminders and notes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If necessary, use an ottoman as a table, seat, and storage in one. Buy a mirror or cupboard that also doubles as an ironing board. Or, like in Kasl\u2019s case, use the ottoman to iron clothes and spare stools as tables to eat on. Likewise, invest in a sectional couch with hidden storage space that can also be converted into a guest bed. And if you have a furry friend like Dohmen and Vaughan? Find or build an end table with a built-in bed for your pet underneath. The possibilities are endless!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find interior design tips that actually work?
