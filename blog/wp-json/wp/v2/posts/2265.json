Here are 6 tips to help reduce stress and anxiety throughout the week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"8963\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/6-tips-for-anxiety-and-stress-management-roomi\/attachment\/woman-meditating-outdoors\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-meditating-outdoors.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"683,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"woman-meditating-outdoors\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-meditating-outdoors.jpg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-meditating-outdoors.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-meditating-outdoors.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A woman meditating outdoors\" class=\"wp-image-8963\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-meditating-outdoors.jpg?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-meditating-outdoors.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Practice deep breathing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever tried deep breathing? Breathing is an automatic function, so we often forget to focus on our breath every once in a while. Try deep breathing to help calm your mind and body and reduce anxiety and stress throughout the day. This is one of the oldest methods of coping with stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re feeling stressed or anxious, take a moment to sit down in a relaxing spot and focus on your breath. Put your feet flat on the floor with your back against a chair and feel your body being physically supported. Take deep breaths in and out until you feel your mind calm down. Deep breathing is an easy way to help be mindful of our thoughts and feelings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Practice mindfulness<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindfulness is an awesome way to help our bodies calm down when we\u2019re anxious or stressed. Mindfulness is the awareness of your thoughts and feelings, and your ability to be in the present moment. Deep breathing is an easy way to practice mindfulness daily. If you want to get creative, try practicing yoga or meditation in order to get more connected with your mind and body! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mindful.org\/free-mindfulness-apps-worthy-of-your-attention\/\">Here&#8217;s a few apps <\/a>that help you along on your journey!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l0NhWtOfbVze6KzFm\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l0NhWtOfbVze6KzFm\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Take small breaks during the day<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Give yourself a break &#8211; you deserve it! It\u2019s important to remember to not overwork our minds and bodies. So, take a break a few times during the day if you\u2019re working from home or doing online classes. Walk outside for 10 minutes or play with a pet to de-stress. Your mind will thank you later! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Talk to someone you love<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Coping with stress becomes infinitely easier if you can share your thoughts with someone. So, when was the last time you called a parent or a friend? Working from home during a pandemic can be extremely isolating, and as a result takes a toll on our mental health. It is also especially hard to connect face to face with loved ones during COVID-19. Reach out to a close relative or friend that you haven\u2019t spoken to in a while. They will love hearing from you, and you will feel better afterwards!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/hp8hfRYOnOWugeDqUw\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/hp8hfRYOnOWugeDqUw\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Pick up a hobby<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the best tips for anxiety and stress management out there. Picking up a hobby is an awesome way to de-stress at the end of a long work or school day. Moreover, it&#8217;s important to keep activities and hobbies that we enjoy a part of our lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you like to read? Are you artistic? Do you like to write? Find a hobby that you enjoy and make sure to set aside some time during the week to practice it. It\u2019s important to find the right balance between work and activities that bring you joy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Make time to chill out<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let yourself relax! Make sure that you take care of yourself and let yourself unwind after a long day or a long week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, cook yourself a home cooked meal, watch your favorite Netflix show, or take a bubble bath. Make an effort to do one activity each day that helps you to chill out. Having downtime will help make you feel less stressed and anxious during the week.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/A6aHBCFqlE0Rq\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/A6aHBCFqlE0Rq\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers manage their stress and anxiety?
