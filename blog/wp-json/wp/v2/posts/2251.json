They&#8217;re a good option if the soil in your garden is not great quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can even buy ready-made raised beds for your vegetable garden or make them yourself. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wooden planks or old railway sleepers look good and are often used to create vegetable beds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every plot is different, so work out the best design for your space and needs.

Herbs, mint, sage, thyme, parsley, and rosemary. These are easy to grow, and you can have them fresh nine months in a year.<\/li><li>Choose high-yield crops like tomatoes that take up less space because sustainable food production is all about being practical. Tomatoes are high maintenance and need a lot of feeding and watering, but they grow vertically and produce lots of fruit. Moreover, you can plan for different varieties, from tiny yellow cherry tomatoes to large black varieties.<\/li><li>Homegrown salad leaves are cheaper than the bagged ones from the supermarket. So, growing food at home will help you save a lot of money on take-out!<\/li><li>Swiss chard grows in high volume and is easy to cultivate, almost all year, and not readily available in most shops.<\/li><li>Choose vegetables that taste better when fully ripened and fresh from the plot, such as strawberries, green chillies and tomatoes.<\/li><li>Keep a close eye on how your vegetables are growing. Its all about having fun and watching something beautiful grow.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:50%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/OqJjcc1EB1zdoa2tMN\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/OqJjcc1EB1zdoa2tMN\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers grow their own kitchen garden?
