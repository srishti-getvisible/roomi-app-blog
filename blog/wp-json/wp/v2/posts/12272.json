What are the advantages of moving to Chicago? If you are considering moving to America, Chicago has everything you are searching for. If there are any lists of things in the country, region, or even world that claim to be the &#8220;biggest,&#8221; &#8220;tallest&#8221;, or &#8220;first&#8221;, chances are, Chicago is on it. Probably several times. But before we begin talking about finding rooms for rent in Chicago, let\u2019s tell you a little bit about this big city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/things-to-do-in-chicago-il\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">20 Best Things To Do In Chicago, IL<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:55%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/26gYUNNdborXSdWYU\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/26gYUNNdborXSdWYU\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting to know Chicago<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Standing bold and tall on <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.michigan.org\/great-lakes\/lake-michigan\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Lake Michigan<\/a><\/strong>\u2019s southwestern shoreline, Chicago is anything but timid. Big businesses, a strong passion for sports, and beautiful architecture are a part of Chicago&#8217;s reputation for being a city that justly takes pride in everything it does. A two-hour flight from Colorado and New York gets you to Chicago which is in the center of the United States.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another trademark of the Windy City, however, is its diversity. Chicago has the energy of cities like New York and Boston as well as the heartiness of the Midwest, with its blend of cultures existing side by side in the bustling metropolis. After all, it is described as &#8220;The City of Big Shoulders&#8221; and &#8220;The City That Works&#8221; with good reason. The city boasts of the country&#8217;s oldest zoo, the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecture.org\/news\/evolving-chicago\/chicagos-ferris-wheel-story\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">world&#8217;s first Ferris wheel<\/a><\/strong>, and one of the largest municipal libraries in the world as well as the largest collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding rooms for rent in Chicago<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the frugal can find Chicago&#8217;s cost of living high. A large part of this can be attributed to the high 10.25% combined state and local sales taxes, as well as the second-highest property taxes in the United States.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An individual&#8217;s monthly costs, excluding rent or mortgage payments, average $929 and a family&#8217;s monthly costs average around $3,400.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, you can still get neighborhoods with affordable apartments in Chicago<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/rooms\/chicago?duration=Any&amp;genders=Either&amp;maxPrice=10000&amp;minPrice=5&amp;region=571a3223bc8d71c14d8bd14f\" class=\"broken_link\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1017\" data-attachment-id=\"12321\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rooms-for-rent-in-chicago\/attachment\/screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5-01-18-pm\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5.01.18-PM.png?fit=1188%2C1180&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1188,1180\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5.01.18-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5.01.18-PM.png?fit=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5.01.18-PM.png?fit=1024%2C1017&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5.01.18-PM.png?resize=1024%2C1017&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Roomi's Listing Map for rooms for rent in chicago\" class=\"wp-image-12321\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5.01.18-PM.png?resize=1024%2C1017&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5.01.18-PM.png?resize=300%2C298&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5.01.18-PM.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5.01.18-PM.png?resize=768%2C763&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screenshot-2021-04-19-at-5.01.18-PM.png?w=1188&amp;ssl=1 1188w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link broken_link\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/rooms\/chicago?duration=Any&amp;genders=Either&amp;maxPrice=10000&amp;minPrice=5&amp;region=571a3223bc8d71c14d8bd14f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Find Rooms for Rent in Chicago<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top neighborhoods in Chicago<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>ANDERSONVILLE:<\/strong> Andersonville is located on Chicago&#8217;s North Side and feels more like a small town than a section of the city.

It is also extremely expensive to park in garages and on the streets, but if you need a set of wheels, however, you can find rental agencies closest to one of the many rooms for rent in Chicago, especially close to the airports. There are several other ways to travel throughout the large city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Walkability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Chicago is too big to explore on two feet, unless you are merely strolling around your neighborhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Roads\/Traffic<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The layout of the city is grid-like, making it easy to navigate.

With temperatures dropping abruptly in mid-October, and no evidence of warming until nearly May, a heavy coat is a necessity at Halloween, and snow boots at Easter are not unusual. The winters in Chicago can be brutally cold with wind chills as low as below 40, while the hot summers in Chicago are delightful, generally in the low to mid-80s, with the famous Chicago breeze removing the humidity from the air.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cultural activities in Chicago<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are thousands of free events, activities, and attractions in the city. The Art Institute and the Shedd Aquarium offer free admission on designated days. Lincoln Park Zoo, Garfield Park Conservatory, National Museum of Mexican Art, and Cultural Center are always free. The Park District organizes free events such as movies, theatrical productions, plays, circuses, yoga classes, and nature walks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the epicenter of America and the largest city in the country, Chicago is also known as &#8220;The Windy City&#8221;.
