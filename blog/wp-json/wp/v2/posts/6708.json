Putting in a doggy door allows your dog to go outside whenever they please, which will definitely make your life a lot easier and will make your home more dog friendly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, adding a doggy door will give your pet more area to roam. This will help you feel less guilty if you have to leave your dog home alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, install a litter box outside so you don\u2019t have to stress about taking your pooch out to do their business at odd times. What an awesome apartment hack!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Organize your dog\u2019s belongings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to keep order in your small apartment, make sure you organize your pup\u2019s belongings such as their toys, food, and other supplies. Decide on a designated area to keep all of Fido\u2019s things so that your apartment doesn\u2019t get too messy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invest in a basket to keep all of your dog\u2019s toys in so they don\u2019t end up all around the apartment.

Outline designated times for feeding, walks, and bathroom breaks. Making time for walks and bathroom breaks is especially important when you live in the city since your dog isn\u2019t able to roam around in a backyard as they please.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invest in a cute calendar and make your schedule stand out by using bright and fun colors. Place the schedule in an area (such as your kitchen) where it is easily accessible and visible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">If you have roommate(s), <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/pets-with-roommates-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">click here to learn about adopting dogs with roomies<\/a>.<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Invest in a dog crate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a puppy or if you want your dog to sleep in their own space at night, consider investing in a good quality dog crate. Crates are an awesome idea for puppy training and are a good idea to have if you\u2019re worried about leaving your dog home alone. They&#8217;re also a great way to make your home more dog friendly if you have a small apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that your pooch\u2019s crate is big enough for them to feel comfortable enough in and so they can stretch their legs. The crate should be a positive space for your dog instead of a negative one!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make a designated space for your pooch<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the most important part of getting a new dog is to make a designated area for your pooch. This area should be where you keep their crate as well as their basket of toys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose an area that works for you. Consider if you\u2019d rather have your dog\u2019s area be in spaces such as your bedroom or living room. If your bedroom is especially small, consider putting your dog\u2019s things in a more communal area such as the living room. Your pooch will thank you later!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/easy-hacks-to-pet-proof-your-home-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How To Pet-Proof Your Home<\/a> <\/pre>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In recent months, many individuals have been getting \u201cCOVID puppies\u201d in order to deal with the stress and isolation that the pandemic is causing.
