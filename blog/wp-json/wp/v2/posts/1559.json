It starts with &#8220;Oh, gosh! I hope they don&#8217;t see that long career break on my resume.&#8221; Additionally, &#8220;Jeez, I hope my GPA is good enough for them.&#8221; is often another scary thought. Scores and work history do matter in a job interview; perhaps you scored less or took a long career sabbatical.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the bright side is that you are one of the few candidates who got selected!  Next step: dazzle your interviewer&nbsp;with talent, wit, and honesty.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pandemic job hunting got you down?

Think of accomplishments, goals, mission, values, and culture. Doing research will give you great insight into how you must present yourself professionally. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study the job description to know how your roles and responsibilities align your career experience and qualifications according to that. You can easily discuss relevant topics in the job interview and shine bright like a diamond!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:110%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/RaLIOPl8MLyWA\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/RaLIOPl8MLyWA\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tip #2: Study your resume before your job interview!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty obvious, huh? The truth is, interviewers often read up on your resume before a job interview and scrutinize every detail to ask you career questions based on it. Here is an example:<br><strong>Interviewer:<\/strong> &#8220;You finished your course in September 2010 and started a job the very same month. That was a quick career turnaround! Tell us more about that.<br><strong>Interviewee: <\/strong><em>Thinks hard about their career <\/em>trajectory &#8211; Where was I working in 2010, and what year is it now?<br><strong>AWKWARD!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you are as absent-minded as the person writing this blog, we understand your struggle. The key here is to be thorough with your resume. Prior to your job interview, memorize the date and year of each of your career roles. Knowing exact details will save you from any embarrassment and help you stay ahead of the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:63%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/WRQBXSCnEFJIuxktnw\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/WRQBXSCnEFJIuxktnw\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tip #3: Do a mock job interview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For a mock job interview, you will need &#8211; a table, a few files (fake ones will do!) and a willing Roomi. Ask your roomi to pretend to be an interviewer and shoot some serious questions your way. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, a mock interview should help you strike a confident stride and help you practice and perfect your answers. During the job interview practice, your roomi can also choose to give you ratings based on how genuine your answers sound. Win-win!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/s4hvzESGZxw1W\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/s4hvzESGZxw1W\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tip #4: Dress for career success!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First impressions at a job interview can last forever for your career.  It is thus important make sure you don&#8217;t walk into your future company for a job interview wearing bulky headphones and joggers. Talk about a career faux pas!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, choose a business casual look even if your company has a casual dress policy. You can never go wrong with formal attire in a job interview. <\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/ViIN80tf1dy1pKpdFa\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/ViIN80tf1dy1pKpdFa\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tip #5: The correct body language for your job interview<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have some wait time before the interviewer summons you &#8211; don&#8217;t use this time to slouch and play games on your phone. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, sit up straight with hands neatly folded in your lap. Try not to fidget or tear your hangnails! Finally, don&#8217;t forget to smile with everyone you interact with. Always maintain eye contact with your interviewer, a soft eye contact &#8211; try not to be creepy. Lol!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:88%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/RgVbUaJRCCRKU\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/RgVbUaJRCCRKU\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6.
