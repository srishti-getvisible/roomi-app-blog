While working your dream job may be your top priority, finding ways to enjoy your time off comes in as a tight second. While you may assume you need to jump on a plane and fly across the world to explore, don\u2019t forget about the endless adventures to be had in your backyard. And who better to experience them with than your co-living partner in crime? Baltimore roommates are among the lucky ones, who won\u2019t have to leave town just to get away. Here\u2019s just a short list of how you and your roommate can enjoy an awesome staycation in Charm City. So if you don&#8217;t have roommates, it&#8217;s time to use a roommate finder in Baltimore. \ud83d\ude09 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A staycation for Baltimore roommates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In brief, a staycation refers to a vacation that doesn\u2019t involve traveling. But rather spending time close to home and enjoying local attractions in your own city. It\u2019s the perfect way to embrace a new city or neighborhood. Or even discover the unknown in a place you\u2019ve been in for a while. The charming city of Baltimore has something for friends, lovers, and families to enjoy year-round, all in its very own Inner Harbor. So gather your Baltimore roommates and get ready to enjoy a lovely staycation. And if you&#8217;re looking for roommates, get that roommate finder in Baltimore out and search for the person to celebrate staycations!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For the animal lovers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Inner Harbor is known to most as a port of call for cruise ships. But the Harbor is also a landmark for the city of Baltimore and a major tourist attraction just waiting for locals to enjoy. One of the most popular attractions at the harbor is the National Aquarium. With over 20,000 aquatic animals, there\u2019s surely a creature or two you\u2019ve never seen before. Baltimore roommates will love the aquarium\u2019s newest exhibit, the Living Seashore, which has become the hot spot for guests, says Kate Rowe, Director of Media Relations at The National Aquarium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cMoreover, this exhibit showcases a mid-Atlantic seashore habitat and features two large touch pools where guests can actually walk up and touch the animals (with proper guidance from our team),\u201d explains Rowe.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the animals in this exhibit include Atlantic stingrays, sea stars, horseshoe crabs, and moon jellies. The staff works hard to create engaging experiences that are inspiring for all guests. So time to take your animal loving Baltimore roommates for the best possible staycation ever! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cFrom tactile learning in our new touch pool exhibit and fully immersive experiences in our rain forest and Australia exhibits, to our close to 40 daily talks with animal care staff\u2026there\u2019s something for everyone at the Aquarium! It\u2019s a place to build and make connections,\u201d she adds.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking for a deal? We&#8217;ve got you! <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>They also offer great deals. Head over any Friday night after 5 p.m. and get the full aquarium experience for half price. That\u2019s right, bring along your Baltimore roommates and that\u2019s a two-for-one special you can enjoy together. You can even make it a double date! The more the merrier, right? Additionally, if you\u2019re bringing along miniature roommates, kids eat free Monday through Thursday at The Hard Rock Cafe.

Baltimore Ravens Defensive Back Nick Perry says that eating is for sure one of his favorite things to do in Charm City, and there\u2019s rarely a dull moment for Baltimore roommates. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always something to do. Baltimore is known for its seafood. Their crab cakes are out of this world!\u201d he tells us.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprised? Don\u2019t be. Baltimore\u2019s foodie reputation is often overlooked. In fact, Thrillist named it one of the seven most <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thrillist.com\/eat\/nation\/where-to-eat-in-america-the-7-most-underrated-american-food-cities-in-2015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underrated American food cities<\/a> in 2015, saying Baltimore is a kind of \u201cpetri-dish\u201d left to its own instrument. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIt sits there just out of the spotlight until you take off the lid and realize all of the crazy stuff happening inside. The art, music, and food scenes are filled with thriving communities that not only don\u2019t frown on experimentation, but expect it,\u201d Dan Gentile, the article\u2019s author, writes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better? There\u2019s a plethora of farms within a 15-minute drive of downtown. And weekly farmer\u2019s markets to assist the farm-to-table advocates and&nbsp;vegan Baltimore roommates in stocking the fridge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"12661\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/why-baltimore-roommates-should-plan-a-staycation-in-charm-city\/attachment\/baltimore-food\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Baltimore-food.jpeg?fit=1050%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1050,700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Baltimore-food\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Baltimore-food.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Baltimore-food.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Baltimore-food.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dipped Apples in Baltimore\" class=\"wp-image-12661\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Baltimore-food.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Baltimore-food.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Baltimore-food.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Baltimore-food.jpeg?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For the Art and History Buffs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, for Baltimore roommates who are feeling artsy or are in the mood to learn about history or culture, the city has enough museums to keep you busy and learning for weeks on end. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Just for starters, there\u2019s the <a href=\"https:\/\/artbma.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Baltimore Museum of Art<\/a><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The largest museum in Maryland, the BMA has over 90,000 works of art available to you for free, every day.
