And the rental market in New York saw this in drastic numbers. The number of listings for places with a duration of just 1-3 months jumped up 40% between April and May.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could largely be due to leaseholders trying to temporarily cover rooms that were quickly vacated by housemates who had to relocate due to the virus. With landlords and leaseholders understanding that many people can\u2019t commit to a long-term lease right now, it seems many are happy to fill rooms on a short-term basis instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The average rent in the US&#8217; rental market decreased by 22% between March and April.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-attachment-id=\"1238\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/how-coronavirus-affected-rental-market\/attachment\/ave-rent-graph\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ave-rent-graph.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Average rent graph\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ave-rent-graph.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ave-rent-graph.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/ave-rent-graph.png?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A creative graphic depicting the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the rental market in the US.

They also found that a large proportion of landlords were choosing to keep units off the rental market, as opposed to offering reduced rent or breaks in rent. This could be for a variety of reasons; our guess is that they were protecting their finances with the long-term in mind, or that they wanted to avoid contact with other people through viewings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>StreetEasy reports that the median rent in Manhattan in Q1 still stood at $3324 &#8211; a record high in StreetEasy\u2019s Price Index.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers understand the effect Coronavirus has on the rental market in New York?
