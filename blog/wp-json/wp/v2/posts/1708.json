So now, it&#8217;s time we use all the spare time to find motivation and fine-tune our personal development. Let&#8217;s find alternate ways to make our careers work for us!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our&nbsp;recommendation&nbsp;would be to get stuck into some of these self-help books that will serve as&nbsp;career advice&nbsp;and motivation for all those seeking clarity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>1.
