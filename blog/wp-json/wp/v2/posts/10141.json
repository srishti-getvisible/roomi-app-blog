As a college graduate, you\u2019re doing great so far. But bear in mind that <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/life-side-college-vs-post-grad-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\">adulting has more challenges<\/a> in store for you, like saving money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/7-ways-to-save-money-and-make-money-in-college-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> 7 Ways to Save Money and Make Money in College<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll move out of your campus housing and find your own place; you won\u2019t have a cafeteria but maybe a kitchen, and you\u2019ll be traveling about a lot more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sooner you have a grasp on your financial situation, the better. It can be overwhelming, but don\u2019t stress! We\u2019re here to help you figure out the basics with these financial tips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Open a savings account<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may not have a lot right now, but opening a savings account is the first step. Keep your money in the bank and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.hellolatch.com\/us\/cyber\/quick-safety-tips-for-online-banking-for-beginners-latch\/149\/\" target=\"_blank\">do the transactions<\/a> through there. Take a day or two to understand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/best\/banking\/savings-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">which savings account works best<\/a> for you and your career plans. The saved money in this account will serve you during emergencies, sometimes return interests, and make you feel more confident in your ability to save.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Review your budget<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you\u2019re taking care of your own finances, understand where your money is coming from and where it\u2019s going. The next step is to draw a budget plan. Your budget plan should include a list of all your major expenditure, and how much of your money goes into each one monthly:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-november-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rent<\/a> and utilities<\/li><li>Food<\/li><li>Student loans<\/li><li>Transportation<\/li><li>Savings<\/li><li>Wardrobe, entertainment, miscellaneous<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Calculate the approximate amount of money you must set aside for these purposes. Now, if there are any leftovers, it goes into the savings or debt repayment. Install <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/banking\/best-money-saving-apps\" target=\"_blank\">apps that help you save money<\/a> and give you financial tips. At first, it\u2019s not going to be easy at first. But as you get better jobs and get the hang of managing money, your budget plan will start looking better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/5-ways-to-ask-parents-for-money-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\">How To Ask Your Parents For Money If You Really Need Some<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Make a student loan payoff plan<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the adulting college graduate in you ready for this? Student debt: The biggest challenge in the lives of Millennials and Gen Z. The sooner you clear your debts, the more you will save money on interests. The first steps to take:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Fix the budget<\/li><li>Set a goal<\/li><li>Consider your payment options (below)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider switching payment methods for federal loans \u2013 <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/studentaid.gov\/manage-loans\/repayment\/plans\" target=\"_blank\">here are the different repayment plans by the government<\/a>.

Review your credit report and scores<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Get a credit card as it helps you build a positive credit history; it also comes with benefits and rewards. A card helps <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/finance\/how-to-build-credit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">build your credit score<\/a>. The most important financial tip here is to use your credit card responsibly and make payments on time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your credit report holds details of your credit use and history. Your credit score is a score that depends on your credit report details. These are important in making long-term decisions like refinancing student loans, getting a mortgage, buying a car, etc. Check your credit report <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.annualcreditreport.com\/index.action\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Prioritize your spending<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your highest priority while saving money:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Pay off debts &gt; Emergency fund &gt; Everything else<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On a smaller scale, keep going back to your budget plan to remind yourself of the priorities. We\u2019re not saying don\u2019t have fun with friends at all, but consider what kind of fun you can afford to have as a fresh college graduate. There will be times when you come into more money than other months \u2013 resist the urge to splurge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/7-best-personal-finance-blogs-to-manage-finances-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\">7 Personal Finance Blogs To Help You Manage Finances Better<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Some everyday financial tips to save money<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn to cook for yourself, clear your due payments and bills on time, use public transport, find free stuff and discount sales around you, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/7-ways-to-make-money-online-during-quarantine-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">freelance<\/a>, hold your own movie nights, and make use of happy hours.
