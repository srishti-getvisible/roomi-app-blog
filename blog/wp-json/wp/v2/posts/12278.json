With an interesting history of booms and busts over the years, Seattle has seen booms through the timber industry, the Klondike Gold Rush, and the shipbuilding rush during World War 1. Seattle has a temperate climate with cool, wet winters and mild, relatively dry summers. Extreme heatwaves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures. This makes it a very liveable city if you plan on finding rooms for rent in Seattle to live here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1531328404716-fe3b7ea14066?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb\" alt=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1531328404716-fe3b7ea14066?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding rooms for rent in Seattle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Seattle is known for its multiculturalism and diversity.

Seattle is also known for its pedestrian&#8217;s unusual refusal to jaywalk, even when there are clearly no cars in sight. While the abundance of footpaths and jogging lanes makes walking easy, some areas can be steep and farther locations will require you to look to other means of transport.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Trains in Seattle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.soundtransit.org\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/schedule-link-light-rail.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Link Light Rail<\/a> operates between the University of Washington and Angle Lake Station with stops in Capitol Hill, Downtown, SoDo, South Seattle, the suburb of Tukwila, and Sea-Tac Airport along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seattle.gov\/transportation\/getting-around\/transit\/streetcar\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Seattle Streetcar<\/a> has two lines between Downtown and South Lake Union and between Pioneer Square, the International District, and Capitol Hill along Broadway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.seattlemonorail.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Seattle Center Monorail<\/a> takes you non-stop between Westlake Center and the Seattle Center in just 2 minutes and is mainly used by tourists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.

Taxis in Seattle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can easily hail a taxi from any major street in Seattle and most hotels will be willing to call one for you. However, taxis can be expensive, especially if you are only trying to get around the downtown area. Some taxi drivers may even refuse to take you if your destination is less than 15 blocks away. However, ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are also available and often are a more convenient option. The standard government regulated fairs as follow:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Flagfall for $2.60<\/li><li>$0.30 for each additional 1\/9 mile (a total of $2.70 per mile)<\/li><li>$0.30 for every 36 seconds of waiting time (a total of $0.50 per minute)<\/li><li>$0.50 for each additional passenger above 18 after two.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Cycling in Seattle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most major roads in Seattle do have cycling lanes and with a surge in popularity, most drivers are also more accustomed to cyclists as well. It can often be much faster to cycle than drive or take a taxi during rush hour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Using the ORCA Card in Seattle<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/orcacard.com\/ERG-Seattle\/p1_001.do\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The ORCA card<\/a> is a contactless fare card that enables you to transfer between Seattle and Puget Sound&#8217;s various transit agencies, similar to Hong Kong&#8217;s Octopus or London&#8217;s Oyster.
