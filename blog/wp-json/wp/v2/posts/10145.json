Your dream of studying in the Big Apple has come true! We\u2019re sure it wasn\u2019t easy, but you did it! Student life in NYC is a magical experience- we can only imagine what getting that acceptance letter felt like! But as exciting as all of this is, there\u2019s probably something else on your mind as well. Something that\u2019s a bit more troubling- the cost of living in NYC as an international student. It is after all one of the most <a href=\"https:\/\/www.timeout.com\/news\/revealed-the-most-expensive-cities-in-the-world-right-now-112520\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expensive cities <\/a>in the world to live in. Well, don\u2019t you worry because Roomi can be your very own personal New York guide!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:57%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3orif8Y2cZqIdpn5E4\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3orif8Y2cZqIdpn5E4\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>We know the idea of living in a foreign country for the first time can be very daunting. So, to make the transition a little easier for you, we\u2019ve broken down all the costs that you should expect to encounter when you come to live in the city. So, let\u2019s dive right in, shall we?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the cost of living in NYC for an international student?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that the cost of living in NYC is extremely high. I mean, there\u2019s enough jokes about it already. So, we\u2019ll spare you the trite remarks. But, don\u2019t worry, there is some good news here. If you\u2019re a student living in New York, things will probably be relatively cheaper for you. <em>Relatively<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Remember, international students in NYC have to pay a set minimum cost of attendance (CoA)<\/strong>. Different schools can have wildly different CoAs, depending on your course and whether it\u2019s a public or a private university. You need to prove that you can at least cover the CoA amount to secure your visa. But this is just the minimum cost of attendance, you will have to prepare for other costs as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l2RnxTpDfRIVtdx72\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l2RnxTpDfRIVtdx72\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s plenty of concessions available for students all over the city that you can take advantage of. And as your New York guide, we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. But before we do, let\u2019s take a second to look at the basic costs that you need to be prepared for before you begin your life in NYC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Want to find roommates and ways to save up on costs as an international student?

But these are just an average of all the costs. If you budget correctly, you will be paying much lower than the above mentioned costs. Lucky for you, there are quite a ways to save money while living in New York. So, read on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to afford living in NYC?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have a fair idea of all the different costs of living in NYC, we can show you how you can afford them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, if you have the option, choose on-campus housing! It is the easiest way to save money on lodging. Think about it- you won\u2019t have to worry about furniture, or monthly rent or even utilities! As a student, you only need to pay the housing fees at the beginning of the year, and then you can pretty much forget about it!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/O5T9MEKuGIhq3WdnwV\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/O5T9MEKuGIhq3WdnwV\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>And it\u2019s not just that! By living on-campus, you save on food as well! Colleges and Universities have meal plan options for its students that cost a fraction of what meals would cost otherwise! Not to mention, living on-campus is an experience unto itself and you really shouldn\u2019t miss out on it. Roomi recommends trying it out at least once in your college life, even if you can afford the alternative!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If living on campus is not an option, check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/a-first-time-renters-brilliant-guide-to-living-in-nyc-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">helpful guide<\/a> for first-time renters in NYC!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to live life to the fullest in NYC!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, now that the boring technical part is over, we can concentrate on the fun part of living in New York!

Admission is free for all visitors on Friday evenings from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. And on other days students get a discount as well! While we\u2019re on the topic of museums, you also need to check out The Metropolitan Museum of Art! For New York State residents and NY, NJ, and CT students, the amount you pay is up to you! (So, basically, free!).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also take the Staten Island ferry (for free), have a picnic in Central Park, explore Chelsea Market, wander around the Brooklyn Botanical garden and SO MUCH MORE!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3oz8xtcKWOCjFGUXaE\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3oz8xtcKWOCjFGUXaE\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/fun-things-to-do-in-manhattan-with-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Things To Do In Manhattan, NY With Your Roommates!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you arrive in the city, you will realize that you don\u2019t need all that much money to explore the city and make it your home!
