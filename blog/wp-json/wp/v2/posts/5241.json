So in this blog we&#8217;re going to talk about how to make money for Christmas to take your celebration up a notch!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But since the pandemic is here to stay, just like with everything else this year, this one is going to be a <em>little<\/em> different. There won\u2019t be any big Christmas celebrations or New Year\u2019s Eve parties this time around. However, the one thing that <em>will<\/em> remain the same is that your expenses will increase.

Make and sell holiday crafts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you make extra money for the holidays during the season?

Become a holiday driver to make extra money for the holidays<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Holiday season invariably means that there will be a hike in package deliveries. Sending out gifts and packages to your loved ones who live across the country has become a pretty standard part of the holidays. And the pandemic has made mailing gifts even more popular. Which is to say that drivers are in pretty high demand during the season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you have a car (enjoy driving), and don\u2019t mind odd hours, this could be the job for you to make extra money for the holidays! Simply do an internet search for delivery jobs in your area. Then find a listing that suits you, and you could become your neighborhood&#8217;s friendly gift bearer! Ahoy Santa!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Become a holiday helper to make money for Christmas<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Holiday helper kinda sounds like a job for Santa\u2019s elves. And as charming as that picture is, you don\u2019t actually need to be an elf to be a holiday helper. This season brings with it a variety of jobs to make extra money for the holidays. And you can choose from being a holiday shopper to wrapping Christmas presents to helping families with putting up their decorations. So keep an eye out on your social media handles for these jobs to come across many such listings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"The Cutest Christmas Gifts From Independent Stores\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Shop Small This Christmas: The Cutest Christmas Gifts From Independent Stores<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Retail jobs are a good way to make extra money for the holidays<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail jobs, also known as the dream job of any 15-year-old looking to make extra money for the holidays or otherwise, can be tricky. If you\u2019ve worked in the service industry before, the idea of working a retail job during the holiday season might make you want to scream. And that\u2019s before even taking into account the whole pandemic situation. After all, people in general aren&#8217;t known to be at their kindest while holiday shopping. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you can get past this, a retail job can be an excellent way to make extra money for the holidays. Especially because of the increase in demand during the holiday season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you don\u2019t even have to necessarily work the cash register. There are many different jobs waiting to be filled! So check out your local retail outlets, social media and job sites for something that&#8217;s right for you to make extra money for the holidays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Consider house\/baby\/pet sitting to make money for Christmas<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah yes, \u2018tis the season where numerous \u201csitting\u201d jobs are in high demand to help you make money for Christmas. The pandemic may mean that families aren&#8217;t travelling much this year, but that doesn&#8217;t mean house sitters are going out of business. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The holiday season is as stressful as always, so babysitting and petsitting jobs seem to be going nowhere. So, call up your friends, families and neighbors and see if any of them are looking for assistance and get on your way to make extra money for the holidays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"634\" height=\"951\" data-attachment-id=\"9310\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/how-to-make-money-for-the-holidays-pandemic-edition-roomi\/attachment\/pet-sitting-to-make-extra-money-for-the-holidays\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/pet-sitting-to-make-extra-money-for-the-holidays.jpeg?fit=634%2C951&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"634,951\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pet-sitting-to-make-extra-money-for-the-holidays\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/pet-sitting-to-make-extra-money-for-the-holidays.jpeg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/pet-sitting-to-make-extra-money-for-the-holidays.jpeg?fit=634%2C951&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/pet-sitting-to-make-extra-money-for-the-holidays.jpeg?resize=634%2C951&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Girl looking after two dogs to make extra money for the holidays\" class=\"wp-image-9310\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/pet-sitting-to-make-extra-money-for-the-holidays.jpeg?w=634&amp;ssl=1 634w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/pet-sitting-to-make-extra-money-for-the-holidays.jpeg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers make extra money for the holidays?
