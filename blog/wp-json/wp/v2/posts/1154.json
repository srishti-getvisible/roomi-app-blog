When you\u2019re living with someone \u2013 day-in, day-out \u2013 and you could cut the tension with a blunt knife, it can really get you down. Often, you can avoid fighting with your roommate by making sure you include these&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/2017\/08\/16\/4-things-include-roommate-agreement\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">4 house rules in your roommate agreement<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when it\u2019s too late, the house rules are being ignored, or the fight is about something else entirely, what can you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-before-diving-into-conflict-resolution-try-self-reflection\">1. Before diving into conflict resolution, try self reflection<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, try to take a step back and look at the situation objectively. Are you known for your stubbornness? Have you had a fight with friends in the past for a similar reason? You might be able to resolve the conflict by being honest with yourself and offering an apology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that\u2019s not enough, let\u2019s take a look at some potential reasons you&#8217;re fighting with your roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-you-re-fighting-with-your-roommate-because-of-unacknowledged-communication-boundaries\">2. You&#8217;re fighting with your roommate because of unacknowledged communication boundaries<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/9fontc\/my_19m_roommate_and_i_19m_just_had_a_massive\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Flaccinator2 told Reddit<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>\u201cMy roommate seems to be offended by nearly everything I say to him. How do I move forward so I can be comfortable in my apartment without having to be on guard around him?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re the offender or the offend-ee, it\u2019s important to remember that everyone has different levels of sensitivities. So you should try to live in harmony by not pushing each other\u2019s buttons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone does feel like a personal attack has been made upon them, it\u2019s healthy to discuss it. That way, both of you can learn the other\u2019s boundaries to make <em>\u201cHome sweet home\u201d<\/em>&nbsp;a reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-should-you-do-if-you-are-the-offender\">What should you do if you are the offender?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once someone oversteps the mark, it\u2019s on them to initiate the make-up conversation (even if they feel like they haven\u2019t done anything wrong.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening the talk with something like&nbsp;<em>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel like\u2026\u201d<\/em>&nbsp;will just make them more defensive, since you\u2019re not taking ownership of the thing you said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, try&nbsp;<em>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I offended you; I really didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d<\/em>&nbsp;and give them the opportunity to accept your apology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-you-re-fighting-with-your-roommate-over-the-house-rules\">3. You&#8217;re fighting with your roommate over the house rules<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are certain (said or unsaid) house rules that you have to respect when living with roommates, that make&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/2017\/07\/05\/share-house-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sharing a house in NYC<\/a>&nbsp;enjoyable. From paying rent on time, to keeping noise down at night and keeping the place clean, you might assume your roomi should automatically know how to behave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t always the case. And when someone isn\u2019t respecting expected house rules, it can lead to a blow-out amongst roommates. To avoid this, flag issues as and when they arise, using a calm and non-judgemental tone. Let your roommate know how everyone in the apartment is expected to act, and even apologize for not setting clear boundaries early on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-should-you-address-your-issues-in-a-polite-way\">How should you address your issues in a polite way?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>\u201cHey Sam, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t let you know this before, but I have to wake up early for work\/college. The walls in the apartment are really thin, so would you mind keeping the noise down after 10 p.m.? Your TV\u2019s usually on pretty loud; maybe you could listen to it with earphones or on a lower volume?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-all-things-said-and-done\">4. All things said and done<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of people would rather keep the peace in their living environment. And a simple conversation about the house rules will alert them to their behavior, so they\u2019ll make an effort to improve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you\u2019ve already tried this, and you&#8217;re still fighting with your roommate, make time to resolve it in a calm, public environment (such as a bar or cafe). You could also try bringing in a neutral third person who can offer an objective view and advice about how to proceed. (This doesn\u2019t mean getting your friends involved just so they can take your side.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-make-separation-your-last-resort\">Make separation your last resort<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And if a roomi dispute cannot be solved, it might be best that you live apart. Speak to them before you make any concrete plans, since your desire to move might kick them into action to finally settle the fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, whatever happens, take the situation and learn from it. And you might be able to spot&nbsp;<a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/2017\/06\/14\/roommate-red-flags\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">roommate red flags<\/a>&nbsp;much more easily in future!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers solve fights with roommates?<\/strong> <strong>With our ever-increasing lists of rooms and roommates across the world, we help you find your perfect match!&nbsp;<\/strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/get.roomiapp.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Download the app&nbsp;here&nbsp;and hop on the&nbsp;<em>easiest ride home<\/em>, ever<\/strong><\/a><strong>!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"jhaqy5ESJr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/help-im-stuck-coliving-with-roommates-i-dont-like-roomi\/\">Help!
