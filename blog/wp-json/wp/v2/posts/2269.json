When being productive just isn&#8217;t possible. That&#8217;s normal. But what sets you apart is how well you&#8217;re able to pick yourself back up. Now, sometimes you need a little jolt of inspiration to get you out of your rut. So, the question is, where can you find that? Well, if you&#8217;re having one of those days, don&#8217;t you worry, cuz Roomi has got your back! So, we&#8217;ve come up with a list of the best motivational movies for entrepreneurs and young professionals to inspire them to reach new heights in their professionally! These are 7 movies every entrepreneur should watch to get to the next level. So, without any further ado, let&#8217;s begin!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Whiplash<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best motivational movies for entrepreneurs and young professionals. So, Whiplash encapsulates Andrew&#8217;s journey (who dreams of becoming one of the greatest drummers) and his relationship with his coach &amp; mentor &#8211; Fletcher. But Fletcher is the most unimaginable kind of a person that Andrew or even us, the viewers, have ever seen. The movie shows that being good doesn&#8217;t make you the best, and the journey from good to best is filled with pain, dedication, and heaps of hard work. So what does it take to be on the top?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p> &#8220;<strong><em>There are no two words in the English language more harmful than &#8220;good job&#8221;.&#8221;<\/em><\/strong><\/p><cite><strong><em>Fletcher<\/em><\/strong><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. The Pursuit Of Happyness<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, everyone has seen this one, even the cavemen from the Paleolithic Era. Honestly, a true Will Smith classic and also our team&#8217;s personal favorite. The Pursuit Of Happyness is synonymous with motivation, especially in the face of grave disappointment and struggles. This movie sums up the quote that when life gives you lemons, you make an awesome lemonade and cherish it on a sunny afternoon. True to its core, the movie teaches us that it&#8217;s okay to fail, as long as you&#8217;re committed to your dream and ready to work hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><strong><em> &#8220;You got a dream. You gotta protect it. People can&#8217;t do somethin&#8217; themselves, they wanna tell you you can&#8217;t do it. If you want somethin&#8217;, go get it. Period.&#8221;<\/em><\/strong><\/p><cite><strong><em>Christopher Gardner<\/em><\/strong><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Chef<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most delicious and inspiring movies for entrepreneurs. &#8220;It&#8217;s over when I say it&#8217;s over&#8221; is the overall feel of this movie. Fun, light, loaded with big dreams and a bigger appetite. But trust us, at the end of this, you will definitely feel the urge to chase your dreams and grab a nice Cuban Sandwich. * Burrrp *<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><strong><em>&#8220;I may not do everything great in my life, but I&#8217;m good at this. I manage to touch people&#8217;s lives with what I do and I want to share this with you.&#8221;<\/em><\/strong><\/p><cite><strong><em>Carl Casper<\/em><\/strong><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. The Founder<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most inspiring movies for entrepreneurs. So, The Founder is about two brothers who started a company alongside a man who turned their venture into a global phenomenon. Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed it- the movie is about the successful food chain McDonald&#8217;s. So, of course, The Founder teaches us how a willingness to succeed, paired with hard work and dedication, can lead to results that you can&#8217;t fathom. It&#8217;s a fantastic motivational movie that every aspiring entrepreneur should watch!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an excellent quote in the movie by Calvin Coolidge, the 30th President of the United States:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><strong><em>&#8220;Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent won&#8217;t; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius won&#8217;t; unrewarded genius is practically a clich\u00e9. Education won&#8217;t; the world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are all-powerful.&#8221;<\/em><\/strong><\/p><cite>Calvin Coolidge<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. The Intern<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most inspiring movies for entrepreneurs while also being incredibly sweet! Not to mention, it starts two of Hollywood&#8217;s gems in one movie- Anne Hathaway &amp; Robert De Niro!? Well, sign us up! But this movie&#8217;s takeaway is not the protagonist&#8217;s stereotypical struggle in their career and life. Rather, it&#8217;s more profound and goes a little deeper than that. The movie explores opportunities and time, relationships, and how we all can touch and transform lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/horror-movies-to-celebrate-halloween-at-home-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Related: Welcome Halloween 2020 With The Best Horror Movies!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Forrest Gump<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Forrest Gump is a heartwarming movie is about a simple man with good intentions. But he just happens to accidentally become a raging inspiration for people worldwide. So, of course, he wins medals, meets the president, and becomes a professional ping-pong player. But all of it is unintentional. He only follows his heart and does the right thing. Above all, Forrest Gump is a story of how goodwill and perseverance help achieve big things in life. Truly, it&#8217;s one of those movies every entrepreneur should watch!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><strong><em> &#8220;My mama always said, &#8216;life was like a box of chocolates.

The Big Short<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those movies every entrepreneur should watch. Oscar-winning movie The Big Short lets us in on the lives of the Wall Street investors who foresaw the build-up to, and then exploited, the now-infamous <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/2008-financial-crisis-3305679\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2008 financial crisis<\/a>. But the insanely talented cast in this movie is what doubles the screening pleasure. Moreover, this movie teaches us about the power of knowledge and the consequences of the choices we ultimately make. The Big Short is a motivational film for all aspiring entrepreneurs, freelancers, and young professionals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find the best motivational movies for entrepreneurs and young professionals?
