But also supporting those companies that are showing substantive support to the cause. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Support could alternatively also come in the form of buying from local black-owned businesses.

Therefore, be sure to convey to your friends and family that if\/when the situation arises, you will be available for them. It&#8217;s always helpful to keep a list of relevant resources in your area handy too. If you have friends and family attending protests, offer them help in the form of snacks, water, and first-aid supplies. Not to mention, this can all be done all while being socially distant as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inform yourself about the anti-racist struggle.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the most important thing you can do if you&#8217;re not black.  Take charge of the media you consume and inform yourself about the anti-racist struggle. Social media is full of resources readily available, even if you don&#8217;t know where to look. This is also a great way to think about your own prejudices too and see how you can unlearn them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/juliawuench\/2020\/06\/02\/first-listen-then-learn-anti-racism-resources-for-white-people\/?sh=38eace0716ee\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here is a compilation by Forbes of anti-racist resources that can help us educate ourselves about the cause.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sign Black Lives Matter petitions.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of petitions you can add your name to.
