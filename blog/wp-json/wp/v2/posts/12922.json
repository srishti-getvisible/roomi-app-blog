Dorms and campus housing may have restrictions when it comes to decoration or modifications. However, off campus housing is a lot more flexible. Be sure that you set a budget and do not spend on unnecessary items or furniture. Remember you can always buy something later if you still feel that you really want it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Available space<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you really need that 50 inch T.V. or that huge fluffy rug? Don&#8217;t get carried away when you shop. And be realistic. Make sure what you buy will actually fit in your off campus housing, and is practical. There is still a lot you can do if you are working with a small space. However, be sure you don&#8217;t overdo it and end up with a cluttered apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pets<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a pet is a commitment that you need to take seriously. Thus, be sure that you have your furry friend in mind while decorating and furnishing your off campus housing. Make sure that you are creating an environment that is safe and comfortable for your pet. Also, keep in mind that you need a place for your pet to sleep and relieve themselves! Shedding can also be something that you need to plan for, to avoid a mess. Fragile decorations on open shelves can also be a disaster. Ask yourself if the things you are buying are going to be a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/pet-friendly-decor-for-your-los-angeles-apartment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pet-Friendly Decor for Your Los Angeles Apartment<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Aesthetic<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to see something pretty and spring for it in the spur of the moment. However, do consider if what you are buying will actually fit your aesthetic and that of your off campus housing. The last thing that you want, is to buy something and then realize that you really don&#8217;t like it that much. Hence, be sure to set the vibe you want to go for!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Practicality and mindfulness<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you may really think that fancy ceramic shot glass set will really up your house party game, hold on. When you&#8217;re on a budget, be careful of your temptation to spring for fancier and more pricey versions of things. Don&#8217;t fall for marketing and end up going beyond your means! However, this doesn&#8217;t mean you should always buy cheaper and low-quality items. Being mindful is the key here. Before buying something, ask yourself. Is this going to add value to me or my space?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"12925\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/decorate-off-campus-housing-on-a-budget\/attachment\/aesthetics-home-decor\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor-scaled.jpeg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"aesthetics-home-decor\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor-scaled.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"student stationaries kept on a table \" class=\"wp-image-12925\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor-scaled.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/aesthetics-home-decor-scaled.jpeg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/why-natural-light-is-the-best-apartment-decor-ever\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Why Natural Sunlight Is Apartment Decor &amp; Therapy In One<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Buying furniture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are moving into an unfurnished off campus housing, then the first thing you&#8217;ll need to buy is furniture.

You will need a bed and mattress to start off. A solid and comfortable study desk and chair is also a good investment. Beyond this, it really depends on the size and nature of your off campus housing. If you are living in a studio apartment, you may want to keep it limited and only get a small couch or coffee table. However, if you are moving into a bigger space and sharing it, you may want to get a larger couch and table for your common spaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where to get it?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For furniture, you may want to check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IKEA<\/a>.
