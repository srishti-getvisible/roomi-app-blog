Studies claim that in 2019 alone, a quarter of all renters spent half their yearly income on rent. But with the pandemic and current governance policies, available homes and moving families might both become a rarity. So while competitor rates in some localities might cause rents to fall, this might only be a short term phenomenon. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/how-coronavirus-has-impacted-rent-prices-in-u-s-cities\/1684\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How Coronavirus Has Impacted Rent Prices In U.S. Cities<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-housing-inequality\">Housing Inequality<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Income inequality in the U.S. has been exponentially exaggerated in the past decade.
