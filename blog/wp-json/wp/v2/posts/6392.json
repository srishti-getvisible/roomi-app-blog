All of us, to some degree or the other, struggled with our mental health during the COVID-19 Pandemic. But personal change in the smallest order practiced at the right place and the right time could potentially make us cope better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindfulness and wellness became some of the biggest buzzwords in 2020, and mental health during COVID-19 became the center-point of many urgent conversations. The transformative power of mindfulness has gotten tons of people out of the rut since time immemorial. But this year, it&#8217;s been a different kind of difficult &#8211; an unfamiliar difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever just found yourself assuming someone&#8217;s happy because their social media says so? Just because things seem to be going well for them?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming people don&#8217;t have fears, issues, and their share of troubles is unfair. To you as well as the person you&#8217;re basing your assumptions about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wellness is when people allow themselves to focus on only those things that they can benefit from. And detach themselves from things that would otherwise hold them back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mindfulness is not an effort to eliminate fear, or block out all the shadows of your life. It&#8217;s a state of mind that allows you to be okay during happy times and the not-so-happy times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five powerful habits that can help you re-learn what you know about mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meditate.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nccih.nih.gov\/health\/meditation-in-depth#hed3\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">health benefits of meditation<\/a> are known far and wide.

The goal isn&#8217;t to become a monk overnight. Starting small is key!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially when you&#8217;re relearning ways to look after your mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even just a few minutes a day can have a profound impact on centering you. Mobile apps like <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.calm.com\/\">Calm<\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/\">Headspace<\/a><\/strong> can also help make the process easier and sustainable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be present.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wellness is essentially making yourself feel grounded on a regular basis. A lot of us spend our energy thinking or worrying about tomorrow &#8211; the future.

Physically and emotionally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This helped me try and understand the cause behind what I was feeling.

When you notice yourself feeling angry or agitated, &#8220;check-in&#8221; with your body to understand why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And instead of succumbing to anger and expressing yourself in a toxic manner, inculcate the process of acknowledging and addressing your emotions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allow yourself to <strong>feel<\/strong> angry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will then able to process what you&#8217;re feeling, identify the reasons behind it, and take necessary action that alleviates the anger. This is what we call wellness for the soul.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep a journal.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Journaling is an excellent way of staying aware of what&#8217;s happening in your life and how you feel. It helps you get things off your chest, detach from negative energy, and see the bigger picture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part is that journaling takes any shape and form you want it to. The sheer lack of structure helps you understand what your flow of emotions and thoughts really is. It&#8217;s your easiest ticket to wellness through mindful behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"6396\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/mindful-habits-for-your-mental-health-during-covid-19\/attachment\/image-77\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-77.png?fit=1880%2C1253&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1253\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-77\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-77.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-77.png?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-77.png?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a woman writing her journal \" class=\"wp-image-6396\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-77.png?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-77.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-77.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-77.png?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-77.png?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-77.png?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people swear by writing three things they are grateful for before they go to bed. This is a practice known to make you feel better by highlighting the things you appreciate.
