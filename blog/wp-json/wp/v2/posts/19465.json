These problems may have discouraged you in the past, but in these modern times, there are easier ways to find rooms for rent. With websites like Rent<a href=\"http:\/\/Rent.com\" class=\"broken_link\">.<\/a>com and Roomi, apartment hunting becomes smoother. However, between Rent.com and the Rent.com alternative, Roomi, which is the best room finder? Let&#8217;s find out!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/8pwwx7jdy3lkI\" title=\"new york\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room\">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The perfect room finder is supposed to have all the features that make apartment hunting a breeze. Filters like price ranges and listings are among the many that can determine the best room finder for you. You may have come into contact with one or two Rent<a href=\"http:\/\/Rent.com\" class=\"broken_link\">.<\/a>com reviews, but we&#8217;re going to break down everything you need to know below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/apartment-hacks\/roomis-guide-for-the-first-time-renter\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roomi&#8217;s Guide for the First Time Renter<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"no-fee-apartments\">No fee apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably don&#8217;t want to use your hard-earned money to pay broker fees. Well, you&#8217;re in luck because all Roomi listings are no fee, meaning you won&#8217;t have to fork out money from your budget to pay brokers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rent.com, however, can&#8217;t boast of this advantage, making Roomi a great Rent.com alternative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pet-friendly-apartments\">Pet-Friendly Apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a furry companion, you certainly have to consider them while searching for apartments. While Rent.com only offers cats and dogs pet filters, Roomi goes further by providing a filter for other pets, so nothing with fur, scales or feathers has to be left behind!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subletting\">Subletting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rent.com reviews have shown that subletting with the room finder can be a hectic task. Users have to pay a big chunk of money and may have to wait months for their listing to get chosen. What makes Roomi one of the best room finders out there is the fact that it lets you browse through authentic listings by individuals who are verified. You&#8217;re also allowed to have at least 2 active listings on Roomi at any one time, which simplifies the subletting process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities\">Filtering rooms based on amenities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has their preferences, and nobody wants a room-finding portal that doesn&#8217;t consider your needs. Both Roomi and Rent.com provide their users with an extensive list of amenities filters, where they can choose what they want according to their taste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-based-on-listing-type-entire-rooms-shared-rooms\">Filtering based on listing type (entire rooms\/shared rooms)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With Roomi, you&#8217;re allowed to filter through listing types. For example, if you want a roommate, you&#8217;ll be on the hunt for shared rooms. Roomi has got you covered in that aspect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rent.com doesn&#8217;t offer this feature. Many Rent.com reviews have also complained that some listings on the website are not current.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules\">Filtering rooms based on house rules<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In our Roomi vs Rent.com comparison, Roomi takes the lead yet again. Roomi lets you filter rooms based on house rules, making your search easier and more convenient. If you have specific preferences like not wanting a roommate who smokes, then Roomi can help you arrange that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features\">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing easy comes cheap, but Roomi strives to break that notion. You can do so much on Roomi for free, but subscribing to the premium plan will make your search that much easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/faq\/is-roomi-free-to-use\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Is Roomi free to use?<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"allowing-free-listings\">Allowing Free Listings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before going into the benefits of Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription plan, let&#8217;s talk about what you stand to gain for free. It&#8217;s free to sign up for Roomi, and you can also have 2 active listings. Some websites like Rent<a href=\"http:\/\/Rent.com\" class=\"broken_link\">.<\/a>com charge their customers for creating an account for listing, and on Rent.com, you&#8217;ll have to shell out a big sum of money to list an apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roomi Gold membership allows you to increase your listings, or buy listing credits. It&#8217;s priced at $29.99 per month and $14.99 per week. This comes with goodies like free bookings, access to unlimited messages, an optional background check, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-app-messaging\">In-app Messaging<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Roomi stand out as one of the best room finders is the fact that you can easily connect with listers through the in-app messaging system. As mentioned earlier, you can send unlimited messages with the Roomi Gold plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rent.com, on the other hand, allows you to contact listers by calls or emails, but many Rent.com reviews have shown that customers don&#8217;t get a response as quickly as they&#8217;d like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible\">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/Y34cQTz8NtDbZ8jENS\" title=\"trust no one\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>A good room finder places your safety and security as a top priority. Roomi, the Rent.com alternative, allows you to report suspected fake listings to their in-house content moderation team. Listers also have to go through a verification process to ensure that they are legit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi also ensures maximum security by not allowing your listing address to be visible to others, and only showing an approximate location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rent.com has a contact support team, but they only work during business hours and are not always timely in solving customer issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you\">So, which is the best room finder for you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone asks you, &#8216;Roomi vs Rent.com: which is better?&#8217;, the clear answer is Roomi. Roomi offers so many features that websites like Rent.com don&#8217;t, making it one of the best room finders on the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From extensive room filters to efficient safety measures, there&#8217;s no doubt that Roomi is an excellent Rent.com alternative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\" style=\"min-height:405px;aspect-ratio:unset;\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"has-white-background-color has-background-dim-100 wp-block-cover__gradient-background has-background-dim\"><\/span><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignfull is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:24% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"5969\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/shared-apps\/attachment\/roomi-app\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=1600%2C1066&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1066\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Roomi-App\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Roomi-App-best roommate finder\" class=\"wp-image-5969 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Roomi is your one-stop option to list or find rooms, find roommates to settle into a new city easily.
