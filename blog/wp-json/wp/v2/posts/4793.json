It&#8217;s also made many of us re-evaluate our decisions &#8211; and reposition our priorities! Maybe taking up that fancy job actually wasn&#8217;t what you really wanted&#8230; maybe what you wanted was a life full of adventures and to move to a new city! So if you&#8217;re planning to live in a different continent, city, or country but don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re ready? Then watch out for these 6 signs that tell you that you&#8217;re ready to shift cities.

The chances are you either hate it&#8230; or love it &#8211; but you&#8217;re definitely wondering what else is out there. There&#8217;s definitely a certain thrill in moving cities, meeting new people, and experiencing different cultures first hand. The unknown can seem really intimidating at first, but once you get settled in a new place, you&#8217;ll probably wonder why you didn&#8217;t move any sooner!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:74%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3otPoRS9De8MjgcSJ2\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3otPoRS9De8MjgcSJ2\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. You&#8217;re looking to start a new life<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have sour and bitter memories attached to the city you&#8217;re living in currently? Maybe the memories from a bad break up or an awful job role keep playing on your mind? Then it could be time to pack your bags and bid Adieu to your current town! And remember, you&#8217;re not running away from your past, you&#8217;re giving yourself a chance to start afresh.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:83%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/SwmYRaqcowXczDPAxP\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/SwmYRaqcowXczDPAxP\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.
