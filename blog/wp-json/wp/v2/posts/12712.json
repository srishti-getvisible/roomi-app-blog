But also remember to be prepared to answer the questions you ask, for it to feel like a healthy conversation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lifestyle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking about your roommate&#8217;s lifestyle begs the question: How could it possibly affect you whether they like to stay home or go out on the weekends, right? (Unless you\u2019re an&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/co-living\/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">antisocial mouse<\/a>&nbsp;of course.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But well, these potential roommate questions are important to get to know them better and to get a feel of what it&#8217;s like if you decide to live with them. If they have a large circle of friends that they host every weekend, your personal space could be affected, if that\u2019s not something you like doing on the weekends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if they happen to mention the exact same things you like to do, then you\u2019d know you\u2019ve found the one, potentially!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What do your weekends look like? How about during the weekdays?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What do you do for work? Do you work from home?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do you have a regular exercise routine? Or practice any sports?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What&#8217;s your worst habit?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do you smoke or do drugs? How often?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do you have any allergies or dietary restrictions?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do you have any pets? Plans to get any pets?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How often do you travel?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do you prefer a quiet and calm living environment or are you comfortable with occasional gatherings or parties?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How often do you cook at home?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sleeping schedule &amp; cleaning habits<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding the habits and preferences of your potential roommate when it comes to their sleeping schedule and their approach to tidiness can be pivotal in ensuring a harmonious and comfortable co-living situation. It&#8217;s often beneficial to navigate these discussions with a sense of openness, starting from a place of personal sharing. For instance, you might consider initiating the conversation by candidly discussing your own <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/us\/co-living\/dealing-with-a-roommates-obsessive-need-to-clean-roomi\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">cleaning behavior<\/a>, which could naturally lead to a dialogue about what cleanliness means in your daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing so, not only do you set a tone of transparency and vulnerability, but you also provide a safe space for your prospective roommate to share their cleaning standards and expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussing something as personal as cleaning habits can be delicate; however, framing it within the context of your own experiences and values tends to make the conversation feel less like an interrogation and more like a collaborative effort to ensure both you and your roommate can enjoy a clean, organized home that meets both of your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just keep in mind that not everyone will be a neat freak, and not everyone is a slob either. What you should be looking for is the sweet spot in the middle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What conditions do you require to sleep?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What time do you generally wake up and go to bed?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How do you think we should handle household chores?

Try and be as diplomatic as you can when you go for these types of questions to ask potential roommates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Have you had a roommate before?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How was your experience living with others?

Do they tend to leave passive-aggressive notes? or do they prefer to talk things out face-to-face? With this information, you&#8217;ll be able to gauge if you&#8217;ll work things out should a conflict happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve asked the major questions you wanted to ask, let them have a go at describing what they\u2019re looking for too. Listen carefully and try to really understand what they\u2019re saying when they\u2019re talking about their choice of potential roommates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now like any other interview, once you\u2019ve had a good chat, let them break free from your questions.
