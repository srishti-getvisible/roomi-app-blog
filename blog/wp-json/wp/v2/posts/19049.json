If you&#8217;re not used to the terminology, it may be difficult to keep track of what&#8217;s what. One common choice people have to make during their apartment search is between a high-rise vs low-rise apartment.

That&#8217;s what a high-rise building looked like in ancient Rome. Luckily, they now come with elevators to make going up and down easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference between a high-rise and low-rise apartment is in their height. If it&#8217;s at least 7 stories tall, it&#8217;s a high-rise apartment. Otherwise, it is a low-rise apartment. High-rise apartments can also go as high as 20-30 stories, and give that feeling of being above the world, and beyond the anyone&#8217;s reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pros-and-cons-of-high-rise-vs-low-rise-apartment\">Pros and Cons of <strong>High-Rise vs Low-Rise Apartment<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"19051\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/high-rise-vs-low-rise-apartment-what-should-you-choose\/attachment\/high-rise-apartment\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"high-rise-apartment\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"high-rise-apartment\" class=\"wp-image-19051\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?resize=1250%2C834&amp;ssl=1 1250w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1 900w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/high-rise-apartment.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While each has its perks over the other, your eventual choice will depend on personal preference.

It\u2019s the kind of scenery that\u2018ll leave an impression on you every time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Additional security<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most high-rise buildings come with a doorman, security, and other staff, which can make living in the apartment easier and safer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Lease Options<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re more likely to find a lease in a high-rise apartment than you would in a low-rise. So if you&#8217;re looking to get settled quickly, an high-rise building is most likely where you&#8217;ll land.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Easier to settle down<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most high-rise apartments come with pre-installed utilities like cable, internet, and the like. This makes it easy to start enjoying your home once you move in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick maintenance fixes<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also easy to get repairs and maintenance done because most high-rise apartments have an on-site property management office to handle such requests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/printable-moving-in-checklist-for-a-new-apartment\/\">8 Boxes to Tick on Roomi\u2019s Moving in Checklist<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cons-of-high-rise-apartments\"><strong>Cons of High-Rise Apartments<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, high-rise apartments are more expensive because of their locations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Emergency<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In cases of emergency, living in a high-rise building will make getting to safety difficult compared to living in a low-rise apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pros-of-low-rise-apartments\"><strong>Pros of Low-Rise Apartments<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Easy street access<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll have quick access to the street level if you stay in a low-rise apartment. This is especially important if you live with an elderly or disabled person or in the event of an emergency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More amenities<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low-rise apartments usually have more <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/apartment-amenities-when-renting-in-nyc\/\">amenities<\/a>, like pools, gardens, clubhouses, and more parking spaces. And all these amenities available with the apartment are relatively cheaper than those of a high-rise apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Peaceful location<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll find low-rise apartments in peaceful, outer residential neighborhoods. Yes, it is often some distance from the city center meaning longer commute times However, it more than makes up for this setback with less traffic congestion, cleaner environments, and a greater sense of community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cons-of-low-rise-apartments\"><strong>Cons of Low-Rise Apartments<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Views<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The views from a low-rise apartment are often not as stunning as those from a high-rise condo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Congested spaces<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shared corridors and hallways in low-rise apartments could lead to more congestion at busier times in the day. This may not be ideal if you like your privacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"which-floor-should-you-live-on\"><strong>Which Floor Should You Live On?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:79%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3og0Iwmv38WmJBrYvS\" title=\"choice\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>In deciding on what floor you want to live on, it\u2019s important to remember that some of the pros of each apartment type may be lost depending on your floor. By this, we mean that the difference between a high-rise and low-rise apartment is influenced by the floor on which you stay. So there\u2019s no single answer to this question. Rather, it must be decided on an apartment-by-apartment basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, living on a low level of a high-rise condo may give you as much access to the street as a low-rise apartment. Conversely, staying at the highest level of a low-rise apartment may offer you a better view of the city than the first floor of a high-rise building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So which one is better between a high-rise vs low-rise apartment? This is a question you must ask and answer yourself based on your preferences and budget.
