With so many resources to be utilized, it\u2019s really hard to get it wrong. Here are a few tips, tricks, and apps to help you split utilities and navigate your way through fair sharing<\/span>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There&#8217;s always an app to save you.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to splitting utilities with roommates, precision is of utmost importance. A calculator and dry-erase board leave too much room for human error and discrepancy. Here are a couple apps that are designed to help equally and fairly split costs and bills including utilities. Splitwise is a free mobile app that allows you to keep tabs. Everyone in a \u201cgroup\u201d can see the running tab of who owes who and how much. It&#8217;s great at maintaining accountability. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/venmo.com\/about\/product\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Venmo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows easy transferring of money amongst roommates. Some banks even have mobile apps that will allow money transfer at your fingertips. An electronic receipt helps record who spent what and when.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-tell-roommates-moving-out\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Moving Out When You&#8217;re In A Roommate Agreement<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It&#8217;s important to discuss every factor when considering how roommates must split utilities.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/images.pexels.com\/photos\/4009777\/pexels-photo-4009777.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"two people in an apartment, at home, discussing how as roommates they should split utilities\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before everyone starts downloading apps it\u2019s vital to discuss the position of all roommates. Just as everyone decided the person in the largest room with a view pays a little more rent than the person sleeping in the walk-in closet, fairness is applied to the utilities. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If one roommate needs 3,000 television channels and another hasn\u2019t had a TV in a decade, adjustments need to be discussed. Timing is important. These conversations need to be had right away, not when the late notice is slid under the door. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, that one person who turns the AC down to 65 in the middle of the night- don\u2019t let him get away with it. That energy consumption comes at a price.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/find-roommate-app-best-bonus-features\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Find Roommate Apps With Best Bonus Features<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Determine and distribute<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determine how and when payments are to be made and who is responsible for that particular utility. This should be evenly distributed. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The leader or control freak of the group may insist she make all the payments, avoid this.
