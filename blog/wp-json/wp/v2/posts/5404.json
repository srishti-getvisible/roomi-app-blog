Though they sound weird at first, they soon become second nature. And many even make it into the Oxford English Dictionary. Strange new words from authors, and quirky acronyms from singers, come into existence. And politicians and scientists bring pre-existing words back into circulation &#8211; until many become part of our day-to-day conversations. And 2020 was no different. Many slang words come to the front in 2020, some that made sense, and others, well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we were wondering which words had the most people searching for their definitions in 2020. What had captured our attention in the US and had us talking the most? To find out, we consulted Google Trends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the most searched definitions of slang words in 2020 across the states. Does any come as a surprise to you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-wap\">1.

It reached its peak popularity in August 2020. No surprise there! This was the month that Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion released \u2018WAP\u2019. A song that spent 5 weeks at the top of the charts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no wonder then, that so many people confusingly searched \u201cWhat does WAP mean?\u201d to keep up with the hype. The highest levels of interest in the states lay with West Virginia, followed by Dakota and then Vermont. Out of all the words in 2020 that reigned over us, this one definitely had our heads spinning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We should all know the meaning by now, but if not, feel free to read the lyrics for yourself; there\u2019s something in there about a bucket and a mop, and macaroni in a pot!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-entanglement\">2.

This word in 2020, was reigning at 1 million searches every month. It seems the whole of the United States (and the world) was just as confused as Will Smith. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia proved to be the most interested in wtf Jada was talking about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jada opened up to her husband, Will, about how she got involved with August Alsina on her own show <em>Red Table Talk<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>August, a family friend, had apparently approached Jada for some help with issues including a drug addiction. She told Will: &#8220;I got into an entanglement with August. I was in a lot of pain, and I was very broken. In the process of that relationship, I definitely realized that you can&#8217;t find happiness outside of yourself.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-pandemic\">3.

And last year had us all uttering the word every day &#8211; pretty crazy since most of us wouldn\u2019t have even considered the word \u201cpandemic\u201d unless we were talking about historic outbreaks like the 1918 influenza pandemic. Now, the term has infected our modern-day vocab. It\u2019s even brought new fashion trends with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The states first began searching the word online in mid-January, with popularity taking a dramatic peak in March, before dropping slightly and staying steady throughout the year. It seems we never lost interest in the pandemic &#8211; and how could we, when it affected so much of our lives (and still does)? The states that searched for \u201cpandemic\u201d the most were Massacheusettes, Pennsylvania and Arizona.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s hoping this pandemic starts making itself history this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-simp\">4.

However, searches for the term shot up in March 2020 and still to this day, the search \u201cwhat does simp mean\u201d garners a heap of interest in the United States. Mostly, this obsession with simps resides in Alaska, Hawaii and Utah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still confused? Maybe wondering if you yourself would be regarded as a simp?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, a \u201csimp\u201d is the Gen Z version of the infamous Nice Guy. Urban Dictionary puts it quite simply: \u201cSomeone who does way too much for a person they like.\u201d And, usually, this attraction isn\u2019t reciprocated, and the so-called \u201csimp\u201d doesn\u2019t get the person they want &#8211; despite their efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-bipoc\">5.

BIPOC stands for \u201cblack, Indigenous, and people of color\u201d and the acronym was coined for a more inclusive and respectful way to refer to black Americans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long-overdue conversations around Black Lives Matter, BIPOC became a talking point &#8211; mostly in Vermont, Oregon and the District of Columbia.&nbsp;<br>However, reaction to the term wasn\u2019t always favorable. Sylvia Obell, host of Netflix podcast \u2018<em>Okay, Now Listen\u2019, <\/em>said \u201cIt is lazy to lump us all together as if we all face the same problems. When you blend us all together like this, it\u2019s erasure. It allows people to get away with not knowing people of color and our separate set of issues that we all face.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers get on with the top slang words of 2020?
