Even in cities where housing hasn\u2019t traditionally been so cutthroat, it\u2019s a new game today. Take Texas, for example Today, apartments in Dallas turn over at the speed of light. The vacancy rate has fallen 5 percent since 2006, while the share of the population renting in the metro area has risen the same amount. More Texans are <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/among-texas-millennials-homeownership-is-out-renting-is-in\/\" class=\"broken_link\">choosing to rent<\/a> than ever, meaning you don\u2019t have unlimited days to make a decision on your new home. If you don\u2019t sign on the dotted line today, the price may change or someone else will snatch the unit. If you\u2019re feeling pressured to lock in a lease in a hurry, we have some proven tips to finding apartments in Dallas!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rooms-for-rent-in-dallas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Find Rooms for Rent in Dallas<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1596601213565-d06722eaa19a?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" alt=\"green trees near body of water during daytime\"\/><figcaption>?

Luckily, this Texas city is friendly on the bargains, and it\u2019s almost always possible to find a deal like a free month\u2019s rent or waived application fee! But as the city rapidly grows, there\u2019s more pressure to make a snap choice to snatch up the deal and the apartment while it\u2019s still available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked to Robby Swiech from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smartcitylocating.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smart City Locating<\/a> in Dallas. He helps potential renters find&nbsp;apartments in Dallas and ultimately make the right decision on where to live. He\u2019s seen the good, the bad and the indecisive. It\u2019s an overwhelming process, yes, but it\u2019s all about knowing when to act, says Swiech. He shares his expertise on how you know when the place is right, especially when you\u2019re on a time crunch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1592409065737-a253f2900fa8?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" alt=\"blue and white concrete building the photographer found when finding an apartment in Dallas \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Make a List<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Decide what is most important to you before you start looking. Do you need to be close to work or the bar scene? Can you live in a studio or do you need a true one-bedroom?&nbsp;Is an in-unit washer\/dryer an absolute must?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cWith a snap decision, accept that [you] don\u2019t always have time to weed out and wait for that one unit in town that checks all 10 or 15 or 20 boxes you have for a place,\u201d Swiech explains. \u201cIf we can figure out [your] top two or three priorities \u2014 location, rent price, finish requirements, etc. \u2014 [you] can find the best couple options within just a few hours.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to separate your \u201cmust-have\u201d list from your \u201cwould-like\u201d, otherwise, you risk going around in circles when presented with your options. Similarly, figure out what your absolute deal-breakers are before browsing to avoid being disappointed and wasting your time. Of course, your price range is the natural place to start.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Ask the Experts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re working on a short time frame, don\u2019t hesitate to call in the folks who know the business. Every city has its own locating services, so find the one in the area you\u2019re looking to live, schedule a time when you and your housemates can all attend viewings, and let them do all the leg work. Even if you don\u2019t plan on using a broker, a real estate pro can help you narrow down your options and understand the rental landscape so you can set realistic expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cWe are the best at what we do. Tell us you need a place NOW,&nbsp;&nbsp;and we\u2019ll figure out who in our office is most fit to take care of someone right away,\u201d Swiech explains. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be on the horn helping to sort out your top priorities immediately. If you\u2019ve seen a place or two you like already, we\u2019ll pull out all of our comparable [options] and call them to see what kind of pricing\/deals we can get.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great source is Yelp!. Browse the pages of places you\u2019re looking into to see what past and present residents have to say about the property management or landlord. They will give unfiltered advice and point out things your tour might hide. Swiech also recommends hanging out at the neighborhood watering hole and ask people where they live and how they like the neighborhood. It\u2019s like Yelp! but IRL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Prep the Paperwork<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re making a last-minute move or not, you\u2019re better off having the mindset of someone who is in competitive rental markets. If you want the apartment, don\u2019t assume you have time to wait. Prep your paperwork before you even start browsing and be sure you\u2019re ready with the info your landlord will want. Walking in empty-handed will only slow down the process, and you may risk losing out on the perfect place. Paperwork requirements vary by rental market, and they may even vary by the landlord. Find out what the norm is for renting apartments in Dallas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cMost places do applications and processing online now. So, whether you apply at home or on-site, just having your credit card on-hand for application fees and the [security] deposit will usually get it done. Fewer places do still require payment with check or money order though. Within the first day of application, apartments will also need income verification (pay stubs, W2, 1099, offer letter, etc), and then finally electric utility and renters insurance set up to pick up keys,\u201d Swiech says.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, when it comes to apartments in Dallas, most landlords require the same info, so pack your ID, checkbook, credit card, and your income docs to be on the safe side. It\u2019s worth calling before your tour, as well, so you know for sure if there\u2019s anything else you should bring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Score It<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After touring a complex or two, they will all start to feel the same. You\u2019ll say to your housemate, \u201cYou know, that one\u2026 with the extra closet?\u201d Even if you have an elephant\u2019s memory, you should avoid relying on your working memory to make a crucial decision like this. Take a page out of Swiech\u2019s book and take some notes as you go instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cI like to have my clients assign an \u2018out of 10\u2019 number score as we leave each apartment,\u201d advises Swiech. \u201cThat way they pretty much explain to themselves which is their favorite over the course of the day without overthinking.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Then it feels like a show on HGTV if there\u2019s a scoring system involved. You can remember what you like and don\u2019t like about each place, as well as how it compares to your other stops. By the end of the touring&nbsp;process, there will hopefully be one clear front runner or two, at the most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Trust Yourself<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds too simple, but Swiech may have a point here. He\u2019s helped hundreds of people find the right fit, so he\u2019s seen folks mull over their options and give away to worry instead of looking at the amazing potential for a cool apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big decision, so it\u2019s going to feel natural to beat yourself up if you don\u2019t give the decision enough respect or incubation time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s just like anything else in life. You know more about what YOU want than anyone. Make a call, move forward, and enjoy the new adventure in that awesome new apartment!\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He\u2019s right: It\u2019s only a lease. No one\u2019s asking you to sign a mortgage for a homestead on a weekend. It\u2019s a lease to an apartment and, quite honestly, the beginning of a new adventure. Whether you\u2019re looking for apartments in Dallas or another city with quick turnarounds, trust your gut and get ready to move into that new place with confidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find apartments in Dallas?
