Because the virus has spread across 100 countries, The World Health Organization <a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019\/events-as-they-happen\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(WHO) has officially characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic<\/a>. A Pandemic can be defined as \u201cthe worldwide spread of a new disease\u201d. As things get worse, a lot of us are asking ourselves how we can stay safe during NYC Coronavirus Pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi is dedicated to the health and well-being of our community. Because, we\u2019ve seen a lot of false information circulating online about COVID-19, we thought we&#8217;d set the record straight. So, we\u2019ve carried out our own research from reputable sources. And we&#8217;ve brought to you 5 things you need to know during the NYC coronavirus pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/KeoRcYovftKiilrKir\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/KeoRcYovftKiilrKir\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. State of emergency<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/sergeiklebnikov\/2020\/03\/13\/new-york-city-state-of-emergency-de-blasio-says-schools-and-mass-transit-will-stay-open\/#fb193886af1d\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mayor de Blasio has declared a state of emergency in New York City<\/a>. In a press conference on March 12th, he predicted that the coronavirus,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p> \u201ccould easily be a 6-month crisis\u201d <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p> He also expected the number of cases to continue to rise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This emergency will allow the government to establish curfews, ration supplies and order people off the streets where appropriate. All of which can be helpful when trying to deal with the pandemic in New York. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite his concerns, he was adamant at the time that schools and public transport would not be affected. He said <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cwe are going to fight tooth and nail&#8230;do our damnedest to keep the schools open.&#8221; <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>de Blasio\u2019s reasoned that kids need meals. Moreover, the parents need a place that can care for their children while they go to work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Ban on gatherings of 500+ people because of the pandemic in New York<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 12th, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned until further notice. He has also said that venues with a capacity of less than 500 will have to halve that number.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only exceptions to the rule are hospitals, nursing homes and mass transit. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ban will obviously change day-to-day life for all New Yorkers. For example, bars and restaurants will have to reduce the number of patrons they serve. This ban has also led to cancellation of concerts all over the city. Tourists that visit us for our vibrant culture will be reduced for a while to cope with the pandemic in New York.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/15\/nyregion\/coronavirus-nyc-shutdown.html\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Last Sunday saw the closure of the city&#8217;s public school system<\/a>. COVID has also forced bars and restaurants across the state to shut down. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. The subway is still open despite the pandemic in New York<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mayor de Blasio has expressed has said that he would like to keep some things the unchanged. Despite the pandemic in New York becoming worse. The subway is a primary focus here; Mr. de Blasio sees public transit as the foundation of the local economy and a vital resource for working people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday he said, \u201cif it\u2019s not coming from my mouth, don\u2019t believe it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper relaxed\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THERE IS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA:<br><br>ONE TWEET IN PARTICULAR IS FALSE.

The NYPD has plans in place to protect New York\u2019s residents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The NYPD is not only taking to Twitter to dispel myths, it\u2019s also taking precautions. They&#8217;re also changing how it responds to emergencies and non-emergencies during NYC Coronavirus Pandemic. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/af8e6e9b265d5f0fa7a29f6ceaa287db\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">department has issued guideline <\/a>on how to deal with interactions with people showing signs of the virus. Additionally, more gloves, masks and hand sanitizer have been given out to adequately deal with the pandemic in New York.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Union president Pat Lynch said in a statement- <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cNo matter how this pandemic progresses, New York City police officers will remain on the front lines and will continue to carry out our duties protecting New Yorkers&#8230;But we shouldn\u2019t be forced to do so without adequate protection.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing this blog, no NYPD officers have been confirmed to have contracted COVID-19. However, that might change if the virus begin to affect manpower. For example, switches to 12-hour rotations will be put in place to deal with the pandemic in New York.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. You can take steps to help slow the spread of COVID-19<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of good that can come from all of us following the protocols put in place.
