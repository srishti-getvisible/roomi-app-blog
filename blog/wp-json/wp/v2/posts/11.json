Where isn\u2019t these days (besides <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/5-myths-probably-believe-living-texas\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Texas<\/a>)? Prices on apartments and houses for rent in Boston increased by nearly 6 percent in 2015. Much to the dismay of students and young professionals, Boston is just one of the many metros where neither the rent prices nor vacancy rates&nbsp;have let up. New York City and San Francisco are the poster children for this phenomenon, and Boston is following closely behind. Unsurprisingly most renters stay put. And those who do move stack up in the suburbs, which are also filling up quickly. So if you\u2019re hunting for houses for rent in Boston, you\u2019ll want to read up on this advice from the local experts on navigating the Boston rental landscape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Houses for rent in Boston are atrociously expensive<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let\u2019s talk about how expensive. According to recent data from the <a href=\"https:\/\/community-wealth.org\/content\/cfed-assets-and-opportunity-scorecard\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CFEd Assets &amp; Opportunity Scorecard<\/a>, about 50 percent of Massachusetts renters are cost-burdened, spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities. The \u201cCity of Neighborhoods\u201d is currently boasting an average rent of $2,945, according to Trulia. Aaron Katz, a Boston-based HomeVestors franchisee, spends his time rehabbing local houses and putting them back on the market. He laments about the recent stress the Boston market is feeling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cBoston rentals are in very high demand. Boston has been strong for years. But there has been a large increase in demand for rentals in the past 12 months.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Trulia data indicates the price of homes in Boston was on a steady decline last year. But the median price of houses for rent in Boston is still soaring, especially in peak seasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The suburbs are filling up as well<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Somerville, a Boston suburb, and other local cities are getting the run off now that vacancy rates are nigh on obsolete in Boston. According to the Boston Globe, vacancy rates have dropped from 8.7 to 4.4 percent in just a few short years. As more professionals, graduates, and other renters come through with $3,500 in hand for a 700 square foot apartment, the middle class is getting pushed out further from the city to find affordable housing. And as houses for rent in Boston perform a vanishing act, gentrification stretches its fingers further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThere is so much demand in the city that demand has spilled into the suburbs and created these issues everywhere,\u201d Katz confirms.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"12631\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/houses-for-rent-in-boston-in-higher-demand-than-ever\/attachment\/boston\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boston.jpeg?fit=1050%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1050,700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Boston\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boston.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boston.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boston.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"People walking in Boston Park, U.S.\" class=\"wp-image-12631\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boston.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boston.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boston.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boston.jpeg?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is rent in Boston so high?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons Boston is a desirable destination for newcomers&nbsp;and a permanent (if expensive) home to natives. Here are a few:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Boston is in the middle of a tech boom.\u00a0<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other metros who have experienced mass gentrification, Boston is attracting many new residents. Startups are flocking to the city to establish themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. There is a shortage of housing. <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like in NYC and SF, vacant houses for rent in Boston are hard to come by. And with all classic cases of low supply and high demand, inflation is the result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. It\u2019s a college town. <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Home to some of the world\u2019s most presitigious schools, Boston accommodates students from all over the world. Naturally, they need a place to stay while putting their brilliant minds to work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">And what if you\u2019re still moving to Boston? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t freak out. Houses for rent in Boston might be expensive and pretty occupied, but that doesn\u2019t hurt the housemate scene by any means. The first step to procuring a sweet Bostonian pad is to let the professionals guide you to tenants who need an extra hand with rent and might just take you in as the newest household member. Rent might not be so frightening if it\u2019s split between a few tenants (here\u2019s a nifty tool to make sure you\u2019re splitting rent as fairly as possible.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Any other ways to save money with regard to rent in Boston?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cNo pets fees or any other type of fees that a tenant may be willing to pay to make their application stand out are allowed,\u201d Katz says. \u201cBecause of this, it\u2019s driving the rental prices up. Tenants are willing to pay more since they can\u2019t pay other fees, and landlords are simply raising prices. It makes it harder and harder for most average renters to find housing.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all hope\u2019s not lost yet, and there are other non-monetary ways to make yourself a desirable candidate for the coveted housing in and around Boston. You just need to be willing to go the extra mile, says Katz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cRenters have to be aggressive to have their application considered. Many pull their own credit to make it easier for the landlord to process their application or they may offer to pay more than the listing rent price to make their application stand out from others. Landlords are getting dozens of applications the day of or the day after listing a property for rent.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers stay informed about high rent in American cities?
