Living with a stoner roommate can be exhausting, but they live by etiquette that will guide you.

They are creative thinkers.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While some stoner roommates sit around moping all day long, the majority run successful businesses. They say that weed relaxes an overactive mind and stimulates the brain to think outside the box. You can be rest assured that they won\u2019t delay rent payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Allows for deeper connection.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Living with a pothead allows for deeper connection, a special kind of bond. A stoner roommate tends to be more honest and vulnerable. They are very loyal, and this will open you to appreciate how endearing and incomprehensible they are. Your <a label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.420smokers.us\/living-with-a-stoner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">420 friendly roommate<\/a> will have many hours of deep conversations with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. They&#8217;re fun and chill.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your 420 friendly roommate knows how to chill and have fun. You already know their favorite hobby is smoking, and they love to get cozily ensconced at home surrounded by food and friends. Sometimes they act differently, not in a scary way but probably more relaxed and high.

As a non-smoker, you have friends who do not smoke and will like to be aware of your food choices. You need to communicate to guests, with the invitation and on arrival at your house.<\/li><li>You talk to them about the food and drinks you provide, whether they contain cannabis\/marijuana, how much was incorporated, and the potential effects. Also, consider making food and drinks for non-stoner roommates and guests, so guests can easily make their choices. These are the things you put into consideration when <a href=\"https:\/\/graziadaily.co.uk\/life\/opinion\/unique-complications-living-stoner\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">living with a pothead<\/a>.<\/li><li>There are moments where living with a pothead will bother you as a non-smoker; this is what you should do: Honesty is the best way to go, but the way you deliver this message will let you know if the discussion will go well. You can ask if they have time to talk about some roommate topics on things that make them uncomfortable. State it simply without being offensive that you aren\u2019t bothered about the smoking, but the frequency that they do it is getting to you. You can suggest that the windows are left open, or they do it outside sometimes. Whatever will make you feel more comfortable and know that there will be counter suggestions, but you have to find a balance that\u2019ll satisfy you both as it is both of your apartment and you both need to be comfortable.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/rules-to-set-in-apartments-for-rent-with-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rules To Set In Apartments For Rent With Roommates<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull has-background-dim\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;min-height:100vh;aspect-ratio:unset;\"><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center is-image-fill\" style=\"grid-template-columns:56% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\" style=\"background-image:url(https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-1024x683.jpeg);background-position:50% 50%\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"13254\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/living-with-a-stoner-roommate\/attachment\/stoner-roommate\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-scaled.jpeg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"stoner roommate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-scaled.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"stoner roommate\" class=\"wp-image-13254 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-scaled.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/stoner-roommate-scaled.jpeg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-color wp-block-heading\" style=\"color:#000000;font-size:32px\"><strong>We&#8217;ve got your back!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#000000;font-size:17px\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find coliving advice with their 420 roommate?
