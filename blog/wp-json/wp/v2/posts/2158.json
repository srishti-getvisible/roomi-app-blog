Maybe it&#8217;s our regular job or we&#8217;re trying to find part-time work to <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/7-ways-to-make-money-online-during-quarantine-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">make money online during quarantine<\/a>. Either way, we wanted to get some WFH office tips from the home experts at HomeLight. So let&#8217;s dive right in and learn how to turn your room into a part time office!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is HomeLight?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In brief, HomeLight is on a mission to change the outdated face of the real estate industry. They empower people to make smarter decisions during one of life\u2019s most important moments: buying or selling a home. So their team builds products to help their clients get the best possible outcome. And in this case, turning your room into a part time office!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what they shared with us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HomeLight\u2019s top tips on turning your bedroom into a part-time office<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the post-COVID-19 world, remote or part-time work is becoming the norm. This leaves many people wondering how they can turn a dedicated space in their home into a part time office. It might be tempting to just drag your laptop to your kitchen table and get to work. But creating a part time office is key to establishing a successful home work environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more people are working from home, real estate agents are finding that a home office is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homelight.com\/blog\/real-estate-top-agent-insights-for-q3-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a feature that buyers are searching <\/a>for in their next property. Here are some tips to create the part time office that will work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Create a separate space<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first rule of <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.homelight.com\/blog\/home-office-staging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">creating a functional home office<\/a> is having an area that is for work and work only. Even if it\u2019s a table that is pulled down from the wall as a desk. How much space you can allocate will depend on the size of your home. But even without an entire room to work with you can get creative! A corner desk in the living room, guest room, or even a closet with the door open will work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One tip to remember with a part time office is that it doesn\u2019t have to be set-up all the time. Having a desk that folds away, or a cabinet to store your work items will help you get things done quicker.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Let there be (natural) light<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"10084\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/roomi-x-homelight-how-to-turn-your-room-into-a-part-time-office\/attachment\/natural-light-part-time-office\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=1050%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1050,700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"natural-light-part-time-office\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A laptop, water bottle, mobile phone and potted plant on a desk in front of a window, with natural sunlight coming in to make a part time office at home. \" class=\"wp-image-10084\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To be productive, you need adequate lighting. If your part time office doesn&#8217;t have <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/why-natural-light-is-the-best-apartment-decor-ever\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">natural light<\/a>, use wall or desk lighting to create a warm, inviting space. Place your desk near a window to contribute to your focus and alertness for part-time work. As video calls are becoming the norm, consider how the light hits your screen to avoid glare if possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Organize your part time office<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Storage will help you tuck away your office for the day, especially if it is in your living room. So the items to consider are filing cabinets for invoices or other paperwork, drawers for pens, notebooks, or other tools of your trade. If you have the luxury of an entire room with a closet for your part time office, you can transform it into a storage center by adding shelving and cabinets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Make it ergonomic and sustainable<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"10085\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/roomi-x-homelight-how-to-turn-your-room-into-a-part-time-office\/attachment\/desk-part-time-office\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=1050%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1050,700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"desk-part-time-office\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A man wearing a grey sweatshirt sitting on his desk for part-time work on his computer.\" class=\"wp-image-10085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are working from home whether it&#8217;s full time or part-time work, it might be tempting to sit on the couch and work all day. But this is not conducive to an ergonomic work environment, or to stay focused for several hours. Ideally, you can add a monitor to protect your eyes. And if you have the space you can consider both standing and sitting desk options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, one of the perks of working from home is that you can make your workspace your own part time office, adding touches that will help you feel comfortable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers turn their room into a part time office?
