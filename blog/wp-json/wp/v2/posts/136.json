A furry, four-legged friend. And you couldn\u2019t be more excited! Maybe you\u2019ve always been an <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/should-i-adopt-a-pet-in-the-midst-of-coronavirus-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">animal lover<\/a>. And you figure having roommates with pets you can play with and not have to pay for is a pretty sweet deal. But a few weeks after settling in, you start to notice problems. Stains on your beautiful hardwood floors, the pet&nbsp;odor that just won\u2019t go away, and hair all over the place. The cherry on top? You have a new alarm clock. In the form of barking roommate&#8217;s dog or cat meowing and scratching on the door. Here\u2019s how you can navigate co living with pets and roommates. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Talk to your roommates with pets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all relationships&nbsp;in life, communication is key to a successful partnership. That rule applies to the people you share a home with as well. Especially when it comes to roommates with pets. So remember that the sooner the problem of pets and roommates is addressed, the sooner it can be fixed.&nbsp;If you\u2019re having serious issues with your furry roommate, be clear and concise about what the&nbsp;<em>exact<\/em> problems are.&nbsp;Use examples and avoid making generalized blanket statements.&nbsp;Here are a few places you can start:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Point out a stain on the floor and explain where it\u2019s from.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t attack your roommates with pets; just remind them it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest to keep the apartment in the best condition possible so you all get the full security deposit back. (Not to mention, your roommate might have also put down a&nbsp;pet deposit).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Let your roommates with pets know that the noise is waking you up.<\/strong> <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your roommates with pets may not be bothered by the barking because they may already be awake or even gone for the day. But if it\u2019s disrupting your sleep, you need to say something. The pet&nbsp;could be waking up neighbors if your apartment building has thin walls. And the last you thing want is to hear from your landlord that it\u2019s an issue. Nobody likes&nbsp;<em>those<\/em> neighbors, so your roommate will understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Avoid becoming passive aggressive.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you do, don\u2019t leave passive aggressive notes for roommates with pets about your concerns. Pet owners are sometimes aloof to things that might annoy someone who doesn\u2019t have an animal companion. Chances are your roommate will be happy to make adjustments so everyone can be comfortable if you\u2019re up front about what\u2019s bothering you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Help train the pet<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If things don\u2019t get better after you\u2019ve talked to your roommates with pets, you can try some basic training tactics yourself. Of course, how comfortable you are with this option will depend on your relationship with your roommate. If you have a roommate that doesn\u2019t want to be friends, you may feel uncomfortable taking this approach. But if you communicate your intentions to your roommate, it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll be appreciative of the extra help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"12748\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/deal-roommates-untrained-pet\/attachment\/pets-with-roommates\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pets-with-roommates.jpeg?fit=1050%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1050,700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pets-with-roommates\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pets-with-roommates.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pets-with-roommates.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pets-with-roommates.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"One hand holding 4 dogs on leashes\" class=\"wp-image-12748\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pets-with-roommates.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pets-with-roommates.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pets-with-roommates.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/pets-with-roommates.jpeg?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No previous pet training experience? Veterinarian&nbsp;Dr. Amber Andersen of Redondo Veterinary Medical Center offers a few tips on how you can get your roommate\u2019s dog to behave better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThe best general training tip is using positive reinforcement,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the best type of training therapy to go by. Despite what you might see on TV with some popular trainers, avoiding any type of negative or dominance based theory is ideal.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But make sure you and your roommates with pets are on the same page!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start practicing any training methods with your roommate&#8217;s dog, make sure to&nbsp;get on the same page with your roommate.&nbsp;Even though you may have good intentions, remember to tread lightly around roommates with pets. Pets are like family, and your roommate may rightfully be very protective of their furry companion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t start any training&nbsp;without talking with the pet owner and making a clear plan first,\u201d advises Anderson. \u201cThe most ideal situation is the pet is&nbsp;working with a positive reinforcement-based trainer who you can learn from together. Changes in training techniques and lack of consistency can really confuse an animal.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is simply too time consuming for either of you, suggest creating a budget for a pet sitter and\/or training classes to your roommates with pets. Pet stores like PetSmart offer a wide variety of <a href=\"http:\/\/pets.petsmart.com\/services\/dog-training\/?_ga=1.16093366.1276780955.1449525669\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">affordable training classes<\/a> and are located all over the United States and Canada. You can also check your local pet stores for other options to train your roommate&#8217;s dog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reach out to neighbors with pets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that co-living extends beyond the walls of your apartment. If you know a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/co-living-101-making-nice-bad-neighbors\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">neighbor<\/a> in the building has a pet, you can suggest your roommates with pets to reach&nbsp;out and see if they\u2019re open to partnering up on walking or pet-sitting duties. This type of&nbsp;mutually beneficial relationship worked flawlessly for New York City actress Kelly O\u2019Connor whose neighbor was happy to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI was living with a roommate who didn\u2019t have time to help me with my dog which was totally understandable. One day I ran into my upstairs neighbor&nbsp;while she was letting her dog out and our dogs seemed to get along. We realized we had the same issue when it came to time and our pets, so we exchanged keys and worked out a system\u201d says Kelly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe walked our own dogs early in the morning before 7 a.m., and I let them both out around noon before I left for the day. She had a 9-to-5 schedule while my days usually ran until about 9 p.m, so she would let them both out when she got home everyday around 6:30. It was great to find someone who had an opposite schedule from me but was on the same page about their pet being a priority. We kept this routine going for over a year before she moved. It was such a relief of anxiety and our dogs were happier than ever!\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers deal with roommates with pets?
