Things you waste money on and then never use again. Completely unnecessary things you think you need to buy in the moment, but forget about even before they arrive. These tips can guarantee you make a lot fewer of these purchases, to keep those dollars in check. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, it\u2019s about being honest with yourself about what you really need versus what just looks good in the store\/your best friend\u2019s place\/that Instagram grid. One thing we can all admit: we all have gone a little crazy with the online shopping this year!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. the most unnecessary gym equipment you think you need to buy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the quarantine and work from home being the new normal, a lot of us at the beginning got really enthusiastic about our fitness goals. And for the rare ones that actually did utilize their gym memberships prior to the pandemic, they now feel the need to recreate their entire gym experience at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting basic things like a good quality yoga mat, comfortable clothes to work out in and a decent pair of shoes is okay, but feeling the need to have the machinery for all the fancy things you saw on your favorite fitness blogger\u2019s Instagram account is way too much. It is unnecessary equipment that you don&#8217;t need to buy!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:177%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/Y4i4fVAJkpOcxHpQCN\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/Y4i4fVAJkpOcxHpQCN\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>For the average person, there are various effective workouts that you can do at home using just a mat, a chair, a wall, and your own body weight. There are also plenty of awesome <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oAPCPjnU1wA\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube channels that you can watch<\/a> for free, that go over all kinds of home workout routines that cater to whatever goals or needs you might have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, don&#8217;t invest in any fancy gym equipment. Because, believe us, in a couple of years, you will look at the same fancy equipment and wonder how you ended buying such useless things you don&#8217;t need!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Highly specific ingredients for food<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This one&#8217;s for all the home chefs. How much time have you spent searching for <mark>unnecessary<\/mark> ingredients you think you need to <mark>buy<\/mark> in order to make your dish perfect? If you\u2019re someone who has gotten into looking up recipes online, you know what we&#8217;re talking about. You&#8217;ve probably come across recipes that call for very specific items that you&#8217;ll only use for that one dish. And if you\u2019re new to cooking, it&#8217;s natural to feel the need to buy that exact item for the exciting new recipe. But most of these specific ingredients will end up being one of the useless things you don&#8217;t need in your pantry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you commit yourself to have a basic familiarity with different ingredients, flavors, and textures, you will find that you can in fact substitute this very specific item or even sometimes go without it. Don&#8217;t let a one-time use ingredient be one of the things you waste money on!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:73%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/Rm3AnLkH6Oy7bwFOXS\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/Rm3AnLkH6Oy7bwFOXS\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. New\/perfectly matching furniture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to feel like your pride is wrapped up in having new things in your house. Or have everything match perfectly so that you feel like a fancy adult. It\u2019s so easy to lust after that beautiful set of matching glass set or kitchenware. But, remember, there are also so many pretty things to be found in other places! Your local thrift stores, Goodwill, or even in neighborhood-specific Facebook groups will have some beautiful gems hidden in them! Don&#8217;t pay exorbitant amount of money on <mark>unnecessary<\/mark> furniture just because you think need to <mark>buy<\/mark> a matching set.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are some furniture items that you want to be a little cautious buying secondhand. For example, anything with fabric can be dicey at a thrift store. It&#8217;s also really important that you not associate brand new with &#8216;yours&#8217;. Because something can be just as meaningful even if it\u2019s third or fourth hand from a yard sale! Expensive furniture doesn&#8217;t have to be one of the things you waste money on!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/jtcJWWyg7vbC70xYJV\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/jtcJWWyg7vbC70xYJV\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>But all things said and done, remember to not beat yourself up over every little financial decision. The point is to think hard about what is really worth to you. And then avoid buying pointless things because our brain loves shiny, new things! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/5-steps-to-get-rid-of-bad-habits-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">5 Steps To Kick Your Bad Habits In The Butt!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/5-simple-money-saving-tips-during-quarantine-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How To Use Quarantine As A Money-Saving Opportunity<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers avoid purchasing useless things you don&#8217;t need?
