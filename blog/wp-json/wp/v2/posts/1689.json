Did you ever even consider that there might be a difference? As our lifestyle has progressed, so has the way we live, work and even drive a car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it\u2019s not a new concept, the term \u201cco-living\u201d is a relatively new one. It works in a similar way to the \u201cco-working culture\u201d which has transformed offices around the world. In a world where employees were previously cooped up in their own cubicles, most offices are now more open-plan. Separate businesses too can sit side-by-side in a more collaborative environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, co-living is a sharing lifestyle that includes sharing a space or values. For example, they know exactly which Netflix shows are the best ones to watch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To differentiate between co-living and living with roommates, Roomi reached out to some businesses in the industry.
