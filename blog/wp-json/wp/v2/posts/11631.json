The culture, the history, the food, the sports- everything about the city is exhilarating! But of course, moving out of your comfort zone and into Chicago is a big decision. One that you shouldn\u2019t take lightly. Like any other major city in the world, the city has its advantages and disadvantages. You need to do your research before deciding on anything. Which is where we come in to help. Roomi has got all the info you need to know before moving to Chicago. So, read on and decide for yourself if <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/things-to-know-when-moving-to-chicago-roomi\/\">moving<\/a> to Chicago is the right choice for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:49%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/35UBlKKEO0rHJi8XRP\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/35UBlKKEO0rHJi8XRP\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If you\u2019re moving to Chicago, be prepared for the cold<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it\u2019s called the Windy City for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.history.com\/news\/why-is-chicago-called-the-windy-city\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reason<\/a>. The winters in the city can be brutal. So, if you\u2019re thinking of moving to a new city for its cozy weather, Chicago might not be for you. Even by Midwestern standards, Chicago is cold. Because it\u2019s not just the sub-zero temperature that makes it bad, it\u2019s the wind on top of the temperature that will get to you. It might feel like days go by before you even see the sun. We don\u2019t want to ruin the city for you, we just want to make sure you\u2019re prepared for the reality. But if you\u2019re someone who likes cozying up under a blanket and staying indoors, Chicago winters will be great for you! Not to mention, the summers in the city are delightful! It makes the brutal winter months completely worth-it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You don\u2019t need a car if you\u2019re moving to Chicago<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yes, Chicago is a walking city!

Not to mention, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.transitchicago.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">CTA<\/a> is extremely convenient and affordable. Honestly, the only time you really need a car is when you\u2019re trying to drive out of the city on a trip. And even then, be prepared for a stressful drive, the traffic is not fun. So, if you want to move to a new city with a great public transit system, Chicago is the place to be!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:49%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/2A0jOlbjxwWVs47KZi\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/2A0jOlbjxwWVs47KZi\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Should you rent or buy if you\u2019re moving to Chicago<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you know anything about Chicago <a href=\"https:\/\/news.medill.northwestern.edu\/chicago\/taxes-make-chicago-real-estate-hard-to-sell\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">real estate<\/a>, then you know how crazy it is out there.

Plus, you might want to get the feel of the city, before you decide to buy property there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even if you were looking to buy your first house, Chicago is a great city to invest in. In fact, if you\u2019re looking for a fixer-upper, Chicago has the second most starter homes in the country.
