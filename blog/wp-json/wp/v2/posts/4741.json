It seems that some extra sparkle and a little festive cheer is just what we all need this year. Shopping small has also become a <em>greater than the sum of it&#8217;s parts<\/em> kind of concern this year. But what do you do when you wish to be shopping small but are comepletely out of your wits when it comes to Christmas gift ideas?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can extend that festive cheer to friends and family too. Even if you\u2019re celebrating Christmas on a budget, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t give genuinely good Christmas gifts that show your family, friends and partner that you\u2019re thinking about them &#8211; and that together, you can make 2021 better than this year!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this year, we\u2019re urging you to put in that little bit of extra thought when coming up with Christmas gift ideas. We love the convenience of Amazon as much as the next person &#8211; but think of the smaller retailers that have been hit hardest by the pandemic. They need you right now to thrive. To help, we\u2019ve gathered some independent stores in the US so you can shop small this holiday season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/IntoAction-small-business-biz-businesses-need-support-now-U0eDLcv3J6lc48KhJk\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media1.giphy.com\/media\/U0eDLcv3J6lc48KhJk\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Happy Black Friday GIF by INTO ACTION - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: when you buy from a small business, a real person does a little happy dance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The endless list of Christmas gift ideas at KES NYC!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The story behind KES is an inspirational one.
