Changing careers is a more in-depth shift and usually means moving to another industry, which requires an entirely different perspective. A career change usually means additional learning, retraining, and beginning a new career path from scratch.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/hobby-clubs-and-classes-in-new-york-where-you-can-meet-new-people-part-3\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">It isn&#8217;t easy and requires a leap of faith&nbsp;and a bit of bravery.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s never too late to make a career change. The timing needs to be right, with a strong foundation and a plan to move ahead. The hardest part is convincing yourself that you&#8217;re ready to do it \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/5-signs-time-move\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">and that you CAN do it<\/a>! To make a meaningful change, we want to highlight the preparation required. The suggestions here will help in preparing you for your career change. Are you ready?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-decide-where-you-want-to-go-next\">1. Decide where you want to go next<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Take time to decide on what you would like to do next. It pays to know who you are, what makes you happy, and your strengths and weaknesses. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/7-career-tips-for-college-seniors-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Have you considered freelancing or starting a business?<\/a> Ask yourself some key questions to understand the direction you want to take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-upgrade-your-skillset\">2. Upgrade your skillset<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Check if you have the right skill set to move forward to mold your passion into your career. Suppose you have decided to become a freelance web developer. Can you code? Do you need to enhance your skills before forging a career? Do you require a web development course and need to build yourself a portfolio before making it your full-time profession? If you&#8217;re considering a move into data analysis or data science, enhancing your skillset with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.datacamp.com\/courses\/free-introduction-to-r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">introductory R course<\/a> can be incredibly beneficial. The ability to handle complex analyses and large datasets is crucial in these fields. This course offers foundational knowledge that can serve as a stepping-stone for further learning and career advancement in various data-related tracks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-find-a-mentor\">3. Find a mentor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a mentor in your field can prove invaluable at this time, more so if you want to start your own business. Listen and follow your mentors closely, and don&#8217;t assume that you know everything already. As they are ahead in your field, build a relationship with them where you can ask them a zillion questions to clarify things in your mind and learn from their experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-grow-your-network\">4. Grow your network<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be eager to get out of your current job as quickly as possible. Still, handing in your resignation too soon could prove disastrous. Begin by building a support network while you&#8217;re at your current job. If you plan to freelance, your existing network is your best link to your future work. Use your contacts and build a relationship with people who might be of help. One meaningful way to move ahead with a successful career change is to realize that you don&#8217;t have to do it alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-you-are-your-own-brand\">5. You are your own brand!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You are your own unique selling point. Many people ignore this, but you can use your Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter to contact other professionals in your field. What you&#8217;re essentially selling here is trust to your clients\/ customers in a market that seems brand new to you. Feel free to reach out and ask people in your area for help or advice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-6-set-your-goals-write-a-plan-of-action\">6.

Outline your goals for the year detailing out your aims for the upcoming six months, and the following six weeks. Your first goal is to set yourself goals.
