RAs are upperclassmen that live on your assigned floor and are there to help you with the transition to college life. That being said, you must utilize your RA as much as possible; they are there to help, after all!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to introduce yourself to your RA on move-in day so you know who they are and they know who you are. Your RAs are there for you if you have any questions or concerns about classes, adjusting to campus life, schoolwork, etc. They are also there, most importantly, to help you with your adjustment to coliving with your roommate (or roommates!)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any concerns about your roommate or are having a hard time adjusting to coliving with another person, have a chat with your RA to see if they can offer you any advice. All RAs were college freshmen once, too, so they know exactly what you\u2019re going through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choose random roommate selection instead of rooming with someone you know<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re going to a college where you have friends or know people there from high school, choose a random roommate selection instead of rooming with someone that you know. This may seem counter-intuitive, but it will help you in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, rooming with someone you don\u2019t know will help you to meet new people! It may not be the most comfortable choice at first, but it will help you to expand your circle and make new connections. After all, how will you get to know other people if you don&#8217;t connect with others outside your friend circle?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, rooming with someone you don\u2019t know will also help to push you out of your comfort zone. It may be awkward living with a stranger at first, but it will help you to gain confidence and it will prepare you for the real world. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/5-things-totally-miss-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Who knows, you and your roomi may even become BFFs!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"6231\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/what-you-should-know-about-living-with-roommates-in-college\/attachment\/random-roommate\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?fit=1707%2C2560&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1707,2560\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"random-roommate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"two roommates sitting together \" class=\"wp-image-6231\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=1366%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1366w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C1800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C2970&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/random-roommate-scaled.jpg?w=1707&amp;ssl=1 1707w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You may not be best friends with your roomi right away, and that&#8217;s okay!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As an incoming college student, it\u2019s important not to put too much pressure on your potential roommate relationship. Of course, it would be fantastic to be best friends with your roomi on day one; however, that may not always be the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your roommate doesn\u2019t have to be your BFF, and it may take some time to build a solid relationship with your roomi. Everyone has their own unique personality, and some individuals may take longer to become comfortable with living with a roommate. As long as the two of you are respectful of one another and communicate with each other, you should have a solid roommate relationship!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that if you ever have any issues with your roommate or if you\u2019re thinking of switching to a new roommate, talk to your RA. Sometimes it\u2019s better to face problems head-on and to work your roomi issues out yourself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need some more Roomi in your life? Have your pick from Roomi\u2019s endless recommendations crafted to your needs. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re looking for a room to call home, a couch to call your bed or a mate to share these with! <a href=\"http:\/\/get.roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download the app here \u2014 and get surfin\u2019<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Beginning college is both an exciting and nerve-wracking experience.
