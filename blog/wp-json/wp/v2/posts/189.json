So maintaining a peaceful coexistence in your shared living space couldn\u2019t be more important. That&#8217;s where a roommate agreement comes in. Whether you\u2019re best friends or strangers, getting along with your roommate on the most basic level is a necessity. And that involves some ground rules and mutual agreements. You have an agreement with your landlord \u2014 why not with your housemates too?&nbsp;Here\u2019s why you should have an agreement with your roommates, according to the experts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/what-happens-roommate-breaks-lease\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>What Happens If One Roommate Breaks The Lease?<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Protect yourself with an agreement with your roommates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of reasons why signing a roommate agreement is the first thing you should do when you move in with a new roommate. Just like signing a lease with your landlord, licensed real estate salesperson Alex Mecum&nbsp;of DSA Realty&nbsp;says that a roommate agreement is a good way to safeguard yourself from any problems down the road, especially when dealing with finances. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example: Is there only a person responsible for paying the entire rent? Then you should definitely consider signing a roommate agreement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>It\u2019s ultimately most important what your landlord will acknowledge. The landlord\u2019s only legal responsibility is to the leaseholder, so if only one roommate is the sole leaseholder, I\u2019d recommend drawing up an agreement,\u201d says Mecum. \u201cYou want to protect both parties, so the \u2018leaseholder\u2019 or \u2018tenant\u2019 roommate knows the \u2018occupant\u2019 roommate won\u2019t bail on rent, and the occupant knows the leaseholder won\u2019t kick him out of the apartment.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/5-apartment-features-check-signing-lease\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>5 Apartment Features You Have to Check Before Signing a Lease<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create an agreement with your roommates on your own!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1574279606130-09958dc756f7?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" alt=\"roommates with an agreement living together\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from&nbsp;financial matters, a roommate agreement clarifies day-to-day stuff that can ultimately make or break a roommate relationship if both parties aren\u2019t on the same page. For example, how do you both feel about overnight guests? Who\u2019s in charge of handling utilities? What about household chores? (Trust us: A roommate agreement could be the difference in an empty kitchen sink or <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/deal-roommate-doesnt-dishes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">this catastrophe<\/a>.) Here are some tips to getting started:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Draw Up the Terms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sit down with your roommate over coffee or a glass of wine and draw up your own unique contract. Open up about past issues with roommates that you\u2019d like to avoid this time around, and list any and all your deal-breakers up front. If you want to be super thorough, Nolo offers a great list of points to cover while drawing up your roommate agreement and a sample agreement you can follow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Print a Standard Agreement&nbsp;Off the Internet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren\u2019t sure where to start or would rather just take a more formal approach, websites like The Law Depot can walk you through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lawdepot.com\/contracts\/residential-lease\/?loc=USNY&amp;pid=googleppc-reslse_usny-rentalT1_d10-ggkey_roommate%20rental%20agreement%20form&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwqNiwBRDnq93MioaqtKQBEiQAb7EznxG5gX2xoYzUz3hP4O4noqYfBn_ViWakYffPT_zWumoaAqvS8P8HAQ#.Vh1CBBNVhBd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">preparing a professional agreement<\/a>. Answer a few questions, fill out the necessary info, and you\u2019re good to go. If it\u2019s in your budget, you could consider consulting with attorney directly, though it is a costly option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get it Notarized<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the contract is drawn, have all parties sign and get it notarized to make it official. It\u2019s important to note that notarizing a document does not indicate its legality. Ultimately it\u2019s an agreement made in good faith.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cA roommate agreement is only binding as far as both parties agree to it,\u201d Mecum says. \u201cIt\u2019s about writing out terms that make sense for you and communicating clearly with your roommate.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A roommate agreement is the best way to avoid a messy split and enjoy the perks of having a roommate. In addition to saving money, the right roommate can introduce you to a new culture you may have otherwise not had the opportunity to experience. Even better, it could be the beginning of a lifelong friendship. It\u2019s all about starting out on the right foot and holding up your end of the deal. In the game of rentals, it\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry \u2014 even when it comes to deciding how to split toilet paper costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find the reason With our ever-increasing lists of rooms and roommates across the world, we help you find your perfect match!\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3vlBc8z\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download the app here<\/a>\u00a0and hop on the easiest ride home, ever!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\/sep<\/p>\n\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These days it\u2019s common for even the hardest working young professionals to have roommates well into their careers as a way to save money.
