It&#8217;s taken us some time but we are all finding ourselves slowly adjusting to this new work structure. Some of us may have also readjusted our career timelines. And for many of us, professional development can be seen as the need of the hour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of professional development as a fitness plan, but for your career. The path you choose or its intensity are two completely subjective factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some important questions you can ask yourselves before you start addressing what professional development should look like in 2021:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>How much time can you devote to your professional development?<\/li><li>In what amount of time would you wish to see results?<\/li><li>Are you seeking improvement within your current job or are you looking to broaden your career horizons?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Before moving ahead, we would like to mention that professional development is an ongoing process. It&#8217;s something that people choose to work on actively and over time \u2014 as they set new goals every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following methods should only be taken as general advice. It&#8217;s also important to mention, this, by no means, is an exhaustive list. And no one needs to keep doing these things every single day for <strong>professional development<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, professional development is a part of an individual&#8217;s journey towards self-improvement. And everybody&#8217;s journey is different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said that, let&#8217;s look at some of the best ways to improve yourself professionally, in 2021!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep making new connections!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" data-attachment-id=\"6740\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/top-tips-for-professional-growth-in-2021-roomi\/attachment\/finding-professional-growth-in-2021\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021.png?fit=1866%2C1402&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1866,1402\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021.png?fit=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021.png?resize=1024%2C769&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Professional development\" class=\"wp-image-6740\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021.png?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021.png?resize=768%2C577&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021.png?resize=1536%2C1154&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021.png?resize=1200%2C902&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Finding-Professional-Growth-In-2021.png?w=1866&amp;ssl=1 1866w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This had to be our first piece of advice for 2021. Some people swear by statements like, &#8220;Nothing helps more than knowing the right people at the right time.&#8221; And we&#8217;re one of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking is a tried and tested way to progress along your career path. It could be networking in the form of finding a mentor, who helps you when you need it the most. Or in the form of finding new opportunities, gaining insight into the kind of training you desire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also means that we need to recognize that every person you come across adds value to your life &#8211; professionally and personally! We come across people who inspire our work ethic every day. And we come across people that reignite motivation every day. The key is to be confident and bold. And keeping your radar wide open for people from all walks of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">??

But time management does not only mean doing more with the time you already have on your hands. It&#8217;s about knowing there is a limit on how much you can accomplish in a day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how motivated and productive you might be. You only have 24 hours in a day, and along with work, you need to eat, sleep and relax too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So good time management means making the most of the first minute of your day, as well as the last.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving your schedule, however, wouldn&#8217;t just add to your professional growth. It would mean resetting things in your life as a whole. Routines and schedules are important for human beings to function. And time is a deadly and limited resource.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">\u2757\ufe0fRelated: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/7-career-tips-for-college-seniors-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">7 Career Tips for College Seniors<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Acing the soft-skills department.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"6743\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/top-tips-for-professional-growth-in-2021-roomi\/attachment\/acing-the-soft-skills-department\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Acing-the-soft-skills-department.png?fit=1650%2C1100&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1650,1100\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Acing-the-soft-skills-department\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Acing-the-soft-skills-department.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Acing-the-soft-skills-department.png?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Acing-the-soft-skills-department.png?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Professional development\" class=\"wp-image-6743\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Acing-the-soft-skills-department.png?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Acing-the-soft-skills-department.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Acing-the-soft-skills-department.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Acing-the-soft-skills-department.png?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Acing-the-soft-skills-department.png?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Acing-the-soft-skills-department.png?w=1650&amp;ssl=1 1650w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we started writing this, we were convinced we&#8217;d only need to talk about soft-skills like communication.
