Whether that\u2019s a good thing or bad for you and your roommates, only time will. But for intents and purposes, it\u2019s almost like a marriage. And as any good marriage counselor will tell, knowing how to manage finances together crucial. Money is one of those things that everyone is uncomfortable talking about. Think about it- Wouldn\u2019t you feel uncomfortable asking your colleagues how much money they make? You would, right? It\u2019s okay, everyone feels that, it\u2019s just how we\u2019re trained to react when someone brings up the topic of money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when you share an apartment with someone, you need to throw all these etiquettes out. Being able to have a mature conversation about how to manage your finances is an important hallmark of a good coliving arrangement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you still feel a bit lost about how to navigate this situation, then don\u2019t worry. Roomi\u2019s got you! We\u2019ve come up with a guideline on how to manage finances when you share an apartment with someone. So, let\u2019s get started!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">See also: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/tips-to-set-better-money-goals-in-2021-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tips to set better Money Goals in 2021<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do I manage finances with a stranger?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There actually is a pretty simple answer to this- write it down. We know, paperwork is boring. All those legal jargon and mumbo-jumbo can confuse even the smartest of people. We\u2019re not asking you to draw up a legally binding agreement with your roommates to manage finances. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve signed enough legal documents to get into the apartment already. What we are suggesting you do is write down how you\u2019re going to be handling money when you start to share an apartment. It\u2019s always good to have this stuff in writing, even if it\u2019s not notarized! This also means that you and your roommate will be on the same page about money. And this is always a good thing!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/26BREWIzCsTAAkTSM\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/26BREWIzCsTAAkTSM\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much should you share?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you share an apartment, there are some costs that you have to share no matter what. The rent, electricity, water bills stuff like that. But there are other costs as well that you need to think of. Do you want to split the cost of groceries? What about cleaning supplies? These are expenses that you can either split or keep separate- it really depends on you and which option costs less money. But in order to manage finances well, this is an extremely important conversation to have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">If you\u2019re having trouble deciding how to split the expenses, <a href=\"https:\/\/womenwhomoney.medium.com\/what-is-the-best-way-to-share-expenses-when-living-together-39192cd2e9ec\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">check out this helpful blog<\/a>.<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Track your bills!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you share an apartment with someone, one of you is Rachel and the other is Monica. That\u2019s just the rule. Well for this one, one of you needs to go full Monica. A lot of the time it&#8217;s hard to manage finances because no one keeps track of all the bills that have come in. And then before you know it, your electricity is cut off and your shower\u2019s not working. Don\u2019t let it get to this stage. One of you should take charge of compiling all your expenses and bills and keeping them in one place. Trust us, even having all your bills in one place is the job half done. Once you know which bills need to be paid, you can just quickly sit down one evening and take care of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/IdyHPMy8eqZ68\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/IdyHPMy8eqZ68\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Technology to the rescue!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s that? You didn\u2019t think you could love your phone any more than you already do? Well, think again. Apps that make it easy to manage finances are one of the greatest things ever invented. <em>And<\/em> you can do this for free? Well, sign us up. Sending money to your roommate, keeping track of who-owes-who-what is so much easier now. If you share an apartment with someone, it is mandatory to have these apps.

Outside of your agreed-upon expenses, don\u2019t bother them about what they want to spend their hard-earned money on. An important part of learning how to manage finances is knowing when to stop. So, just let them breathe. If they are holding up to their end of the bargain, let them spend their money on whatever they want. Even if it\u2019s something ridiculous like a giant ceramic dog. (Yes, that\u2019s another Friends reference, no regrets!).<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/E1ZjSVj1ot1SM\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/E1ZjSVj1ot1SM\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">You may also like: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/6-shared-apps-for-roommates-to-maintain-peace-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">6 Shared Apps for Roommates to Help Keep Your Apartment A Conflict-Free Zone<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you share an apartment with someone, you share your life with them.
