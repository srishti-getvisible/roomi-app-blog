So you paid the plumber for that leaky sink, but they covered the gas bill last quarter. They complain because they paid for the communal spices, but you somehow always seem to be buying the toilet paper. Sharing expenses with roommates can be a nightmare for your bank account &#8211; and doing it wrong can cause arguments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team at Roomi wants to ensure that you steer clear of <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/annoying-habits-to-avoid-when-co-living-with-roomis-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the habits that put your in the &#8220;annoying roommate&#8221; zone<\/a>, which includes playing fair with coliving expenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To opt for a laid-back, \u201cgive-and-take\u201d approach may feel like a good idea at first. However, it\u2019s easy to feel like you\u2019re paying more than your share of the expenses. <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/roommate-etiquette-guidelines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roommate etiquette guidelines<\/a> dictate that one should be contributing to the costs of a coliving space.

You can easily add the things you pay for and how much they cost, and all housemates will get access to this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/crying-jon-stewart-hAcDHEhZHA2bu\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you want to settle the balance, Splitwise will calculate the difference in how much money people owe and are owed. It makes tracking expenses simple and &#8211; dare we say it &#8211; enjoyable!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>@zachBales on Reddit is a huge advocate of the app, saying:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><em>\u201cSplitwise is my life. It just keeps a running total and often things will just even out naturally as people pay for different things. If it doesn&#8217;t balance out then you can do an e-transfer each month. I haven&#8217;t personally found a more streamlined option than that.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-kittysplit-an-expense-tool-for-all-your-coliving-needs\">2.

Just be sure you don\u2019t use a whiteboard to track expenses, since anyone can make adjustments if they feel like it!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/bored-gravity-falls-writing-KyGiMJokZEQvu\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes sense to gather your roommates early on to establish which living expenses you plan on sharing. This can save you money, since it could mean only paying for one Netflix membership instead of three, for example.

Each roommate would contribute a predetermined amount each month, which will be used to cover things like bills, unexpected expenses or repairs, and everyday household items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/IntoAction-f7MO098FCipmq0eUpV\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This, however, can lead to debates. Some months, housemates may need to contribute more to shared expenses than other months. In this case, everyone has to trust each other to not dip into the account for personal reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers learn how to handle shared expenses when coliving?
