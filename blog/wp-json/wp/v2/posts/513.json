Maybe you\u2019re an aspiring actor trying to break into Broadway, or the burgeoning TV and movie scene? Maybe you are just looking to get out of your one traffic light town.<\/span> Or you just <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like the hustle and bustle of the big city. &nbsp;But no one told you that the rent for an average studio is over two grand a month<\/span>.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And a one-bedroom is another thousand dollars on top of that. <\/span>Here&#8217;s what we have to say. Shared housing in Manhattan.

We crave to be around others, and loneliness is real when you\u2019re all by yourself in your apartment on any given weeknight.
