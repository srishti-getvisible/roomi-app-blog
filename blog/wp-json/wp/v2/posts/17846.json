Or a roommate who only spoke to you through a puppet? These experiences do give PTSD vibes. For some of you, finding a perfect roommate seems like a farfetched dream. This could be because of some bad experiences in the past or stories you\u2019ve heard from your friends. But, we are here to solve that problem for you. In this blog, we will be looking at two roommate finders, Roomie and Cirtru. Since not all apps are created equally, in this blog we will dissect these two roommate finders to help you pick the one that best suits your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:116%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/uyWTOgNGGWfks\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/rihanna-gif-uyWTOgNGGWfks\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid\">Pricing: Are these roommate finder apps free or paid?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you believe that everything comes at price? Well, get ready to be surprised. Here, we\u2019ll take a look at Roomi and Cirtru and compare the costs of their roommate finding services for both applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cirtru:<\/strong> A free roommate finder, made convenient to use for everyone. If you&#8217;re looking for a rental property near you, the customized search results will always offer you the best options, taking into account your preferences. While the app is free to use, some of the features are hidden behind a paywall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Roomi:<\/strong> As a free user, you can message\/swipe up to five times per day. You can also post or activate two listings. Unlike Cirtru roommate finder services, <strong>Roomi<\/strong> has no monthly subscription fees and no hidden messaging expenses. Moreover, there&#8217;s no additional fees for seeing postings first. Roomi does, however, offer its users a Gold Subscription package. With this, you get unlimited swipes (if you&#8217;re using the mobile app) and messages. Plus, get Verified to give your rankings a boost. You&#8217;ll get more views as a potential roommate yourself. Roomi offers weekly and monthly packages starting at $14.99, so you can pick a pricing plan as per your needs and budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all of these added features, investing in Roomi Gold might be worth it, because it will increase your chances of finding a great roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/are-senior-roommates-right-for-you-tips-from-two-and-a-half-men\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Are Senior Roommates Suitable For You?

You need to be very careful about who you commit to living with. If you&#8217;re thinking it&#8217;s too big of a risk, though &#8211; that it&#8217;s not safe &#8211; we&#8217;re here to put your mind at rest. It can be, if you do it right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These apps take the safety of their users very seriously. Especially the one that verify their users&#8217; identities and carry out thorough background checks. Let&#8217;s have a look at how Cirtru and Roomi compare in terms of some of the security features that are accessible to roommate hunters on their sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Verifiable roommate contact info:<\/strong> Roomi verifies user profiles using <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.freshdesk.com\/en\/support\/solutions\/articles\/44002035258-what-is-globalid-\" class=\"broken_link\">GlobalID<\/a>. You will have to input some personal information to get an approval. But don&#8217;t worry, your details will be held safely and securely. And, you can request for them to be removed at any time under the terms of GDPR. Your GlobalID serves as a digital ID that confirms all of your accounts and assists you in establishing a verified profile that others can rely on. Cirtru users, on the other hand, may create both verified and unverified profiles.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>ID verification:<\/strong> Cirtru&#8217;s platform does not verify the identities of all its users. Under Roomi Gold, all IDs are authenticated using GlobalID, which makes it that bit safer. Another benefit of using Roomi is that you have total control over who can access your contact details and get in touch.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Privacy and security of profiles:<\/strong> Roomi takes extra precautions to establish profiles are real and that your personal information does not get shared without your approval. On Roomi, users have to post a profile photo in order to verify their accounts. This photo is carefully inspected to make sure that the user&#8217;s face is visible. This makes it more difficult for individuals to create fake accounts using images of objects or buildings. Cirtru also takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. However, users on that platform do not have to submit a profile photo for verification.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>24\/7 support &amp; content moderation:<\/strong> On its website and mobile app, Roomi provides content moderation 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Plus, they employ a dedicated support team who are always on hand to answer your specific questions or assist you with any problems you may encounter. This simplifies and streamlines your search for housemates.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Criminal background check: Roomi<\/strong> knows it&#8217;s a good idea to find out exactly who you are going to be living with, so they can perform criminal background checks on potential roomies by request. Plus, if you submit your own profile for a background check via this platform, you will notice you get more matches from other, safety-conscious roomies! On the other hand, Cirtru does not provide this service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/apartment-security-system\/\">Apartment Security Systems: Steps You Can Take As A Renter<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-which-app-makes-it-easier-to-find-your-perfect-roommate\">Which App Makes It Easier to Find Your Perfect Roommate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding the right roommate online is even more difficult than finding the right date, since you&#8217;ll be sharing a space, a life, and not just a meal with them! As a result, it&#8217;s crucial to select a roommate that not only respects your personal space but also makes you feel at ease. Finding roommates in a new location is always tricky, but it can be even more difficult if you have specific needs that need to be met.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi&#8217;s algorithms use preset filters to determine who would make a good roommate for you. The preferences you select determines this. Do you think a senior would make the greatest roommate? That&#8217;s not an issue! Simply choose the appropriate filter, and Roomi will locate a match for you based on your criteria. Is it feasible to locate an LGBTQ or nonbinary roommate? Simply change your filters, and the Roomi algorithm will handle everything else. Roomi does not discriminate, therefore you may search using any criterion. You also have the option of using other filters, such as neighbourhood preferences and home rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Cirtru and Roomi ask for information about where you want to live, what you&#8217;re looking for in a potential roommate, and some amusing facts about yourself. You may also fill in a description box with your interests and the type of rental you&#8217;re searching for. You can use the Roomi app to add a variety of different filters that will greatly aid your roommate finding search.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The greatest advantage Roomi has over other roommate finders is that it&#8217;s an integrated software that lets you search for both rooms and roommates in one location. This is done using an algorithm that&#8217;s been tried and tested by over 50,000 roommates across the world. Cirtru, on the other hand, has users from over 20,000 businesses and college networks. The Roomi app is extremely user-friendly, and everything you need is right at your fingertips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/roommates?utm_source=cirtru-alternative-choose-best-roommate-finder&amp;utm_medium=us-blog-comparison&amp;utm_campaign=find-roommates&amp;utm_id=roomi-find-roommates&amp;utm_content=roommates-comparison-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Find Roommates<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/types-of-college-roommates-hogwarts-edition\/\">10 Types Of College Roommates: Hogwarts Edition<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-so-which-is-the-best-roommate-finder-for-you\">So, Which Is The Best Roommate Finder for You?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/YrZp047Sna8rFMK7Xl\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/goggleboxaustralia-gogglebox-goggleboxau-goggleboxau2020-YrZp047Sna8rFMK7Xl\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Jumping through any number of hoops to find yourself a perfect roommate is worth the trouble. You want to make sure they&#8217;re trustworthy, share your hobbies, have similar values, and are someone you can relate to. Well, Roomi can help you find a roommate who is all that and more! After reviewing all the features of both apps, Roomi seems to be the best Cirtru alternative because it offers more features and security to users. Furthermore, Roomi offers a user-friendly interface and gives you the opportunity to chat and get to know your roommate first.
