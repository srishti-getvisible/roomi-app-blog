Research is vital in finding cheap and affordable housing in New York. If you&#8217;re moving from another city, spend some time to look at rental postings online to get an estimate of rent, space and neighborhoods. Some great platforms to find apartments and do research are&nbsp;<a label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.zillow.com\/homes\/for_rent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Zillow rentals<\/a>,&nbsp;<a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.listingsproject.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Listing Projects<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/streeteasy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Streeteasy<\/a>. You&#8217;ll have to do much of your apartment hunting online, because coronavirus has pretty much shut everything down. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also browse a variety of rental postings on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/547466899383959\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">private and public groups on Facebook<\/a>. Additionally, explore&nbsp;Craigslist&nbsp;to find sublets or rental postings, and if you&#8217;re lucky, you might even come across Rent Stabilized Apartments too! Rent Stabilized places are hard to come by, but they are great and can save you from crazy price hikes and unfair landlord behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><em>&#8220;Rent stabilization is a form of rent regulation in New York that&#8217;s overseen by the New York state Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). It is different, but related to, rent control. For an apartment to be rent-controlled, the same tenant, or a &#8220;lawful successor&#8221; of that tenant (i.e., a family member or spouse), needs to have been living in the apartment continuously since 1971. No new rent-controlled apartments are created. &#8221; <\/em><\/p><cite><em>&#8211; Curbed, New York<\/em><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/xUPGcIj3cQ97KtLRug\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/xUPGcIj3cQ97KtLRug\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s an ideal time to find affordable housing in New York?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fall and winter are the best seasons to move if you want to get affordable housing in New York! So, if you have the luxury to choose (<em>consider it!<\/em>), it could save you tons of money. Student internships and graduate programs start in summer, which attracts students to find accommodation in the city. This makes the New York City rental prices even more competitive. Typically, fewer people will be moving to NYC during the winters, making landlords more willing to cut you a great deal. We live in unprecedented times due to the coronavirus pandemic, which is unfortunate in all aspects except for one silver lining &#8211;&nbsp;<em>the buyer&#8217;s market<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic forced many residents to leave the city because of the ambiguity and large scale impact. This has led to many landlords willing to rent their apartments at a lower cost (this means we are in the buyer&#8217;s market and can essentially negotiate the price.) The coronavirus pandemic has also opened sublet options because of many students moving back home. So, a good relationship with your subletter could land you an excellent deal. Use this opportunity to stay in the city while finding your dream apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Conclusion: Offseason and unpopular times mean cheaper rent.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/apartment-hunting-in-la-part-1-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Related: Renting in Los Angeles: Part 1 \u2013 The Search Guide<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paperwork &amp; finances before moving to New York<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re moving to NYC, money flies.

That might seem a little expensive, but that&#8217;s just how much affordable housing in New York is going to cost. Depending on your needs and outgoings, this amount may vary. Still, New Yorkers (or renters in any high-demand markets) must save 3-4 months of rent before moving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rental Structure <\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Price<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>What is it?<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Application fee<\/td><td>$20<\/td><td>A fee that all potential tenants pay to submit their applications for the landlord to review.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Security deposit<\/td><td>$2000<\/td><td>A good faith deposit along with the application fee.
