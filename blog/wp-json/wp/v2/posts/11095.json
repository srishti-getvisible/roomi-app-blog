This statement is especially true when it comes to the city&#8217;s (not so) beloved public transit system, the Subway! The subway in NYC is famous for a lot of things, one of our top favorites being that one time\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1nnRC6jDOCI\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hozier performed a few songs for commuters at the Rockefeller Center subway stop in NYC<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0(Yep, just like that!). The New York City Subway Station has the most number of stations in the WORLD. In pre-corona days this would amount to overcrowding, delays, and service changes, the kind of barely-controlled chaos in a train in NYC. And overwhelm even the most seasoned city dwellers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some hacks that can help prepare you for the subway train in NYC to navigate the system better!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How much is a subway ride in NYC?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/secure.notion-static.com\/806743be-14af-4e3d-9324-be29b289b108\/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"22 Street Station at Downtown and Brooklyn\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Riding the subway costs $2.75 for most riders.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>People with disabilities or who are 65 or older are eligible for a reduced fare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>An unlimited rides&#8217; MetroCard can save you money.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These give you unlimited swipes for a certain length of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>MetroCards cost $1.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All cards except for the Single Ride card are refillable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Up to three children under 44 inches tall ride for free!<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is applicable when they\u2019re with a fare-paying adult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>You pay the fare at turnstiles before you board the train.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t have to do anything after.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Now with services up and running again, the NYC subway demands a $50 fine from riders who refuse to wear a mask.

Here are some apps you need if you&#8217;re planning on frequenting the NYC subway:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/exit-strategy-nyc-subway-map\/id320946370?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Exit Strategy<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If like most New Yorkers you\u2019re really in a rush, this app tells you where to best board and off the train! We love anything that helps us save time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/nyc-subway-24-hour-kickmap\/id285668269?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">KickMap<\/a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/google-maps-real-time-navigation\/id585027354?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Maps<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for help with directions, plus transit alerts if there are service changes, KickMaps and Google Maps do the job perfectly well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Look for that black &amp; white board, and the conductor at the subway train in NYC!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/secure.notion-static.com\/67e80289-9108-4736-adef-18a3784d1d4d\/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a subway platform with passengers waiting\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find yourself in a fix that you doubt an app can solve, just place yourself under one of those black-and-white boards that hang over the middle of the platform. Why you may ask? Because conductors use these boards to make sure the train is aligned properly in the station, and their cars always stop in front of them, so you\u2019ll be ready to ask a quick question before the train has to move on. Pretty neat trick, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is it safe to ride the subway at night? And other safety concerns.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/secure.notion-static.com\/6dfdd6a7-397d-439e-9074-ed0c9a9a090b\/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a subway train in NYC headed towards the World Trade Center\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, the subway is a much safer place than it used to be a couple of decades ago. But there&#8217;s little reassurance in that statement. Here are some things you can do to ensure your safety on the subway and beyond it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyc.gov\/html\/nypd\/html\/crime_prevention\/riding_the_subway.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">The NYPD advises riders to:<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Make use of a station&#8217;s off-hours waiting area. This may vary from station to station but is typically next to the station agent&#8217;s booth. And if you&#8217;re traveling late at night, it&#8217;s best to ride in the conductor&#8217;s car.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There will be times when you should avoid the subway entirely.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In which case, rideshare services like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.uber.com\/in\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Uber<\/a>&nbsp;are a relatively affordable alternative.

Staying alert is the least you can do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another aspect of self-protection involves keeping an eye on your fellow passengers\u2019 behavior and body language. Stay aware of your surroundings. For some people, this might mean losing their headphones. And if someone strikes you as erratic or threatening, try to move to a different car, or simply get off the train.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many subway stations now have&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/web.mta.info\/innov-hp.htm\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">&#8220;Help Points,&#8221;<\/a>&nbsp;which allow passengers to call in case of emergencies and ask for help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:\u00a0<a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains-part-2-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Traveling with NYC\u2019s Transit System: Part 2<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avoiding the empty train car is in YOUR best interest.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/secure.notion-static.com\/f374116e-c2af-4012-bbcd-50500b594c8c\/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a train in NYC at the subway station platform arriving for passengers\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just think about it.
