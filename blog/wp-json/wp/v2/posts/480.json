S<\/span>o h<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ave you considered finding a<a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/finding-short-term-rentals-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> short term rental in NYC<\/a> to learn more about the city its unique (read as difficult) move in process? You might even save some hard earned cash by doing so. Here\u2019s a list of 10 rental hacks and why they work when it comes to a short term rental in NYC before taking the plunge.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1.<b> You can make sure NYC is for you<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Big Apple is legendary. Intense, crowded, rich in opportunity, diverse, and fast paced. And, hey, it\u2019s not for everyone. <\/span>However, i<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">f NYC isn\u2019t for you, that\u2019s not a bad thing or a good thing. It\u2019s just a you thing. Better to hang around for a few months, rack up some awesome stories to share with family and friends back home, then say, \u201cNah, it\u2019s just not for me.\u201d You gave it a shot, that\u2019s what matters. Maybe you like country life, or you want to try an international city, like Tokyo.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. You get to <b>become a steely-eyed veteran of the New York lease signing process<\/b><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s one of the most important rental hacks for you. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signing a lease in New York is definitely more involved than your average lease agreement elsewhere in the USA. Because lots of landlords in New York only go through brokers<\/span>,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a short term lease can give you a chance to get to know a good one. There are extra fee\u2019s you might not be used to, and you\u2019ll want to bring proof of income plus pass a credit check. You\u2019ll need a guarantor as well. Moreover, <\/span>g<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ood apartments move fast in NYC, and a short term rental will leave you seasoned, prepped, and ready to side tackle one the moment it becomes available.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>3. Pre-Furnished short term rentals can save you cash<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some short term rentals are pre-furbished. Do they cost more per month? Of course they do. But compared to moving your own stuff, you could easily come out ahead for a short term stay. Think about it.<\/span><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.brickunderground.com\/blog\/2013\/12\/moving_in_the_new_year_heres_what_it_will_cost_you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving furniture in New York City<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can cost $600-$1000 on average. If you\u2019re only staying for a month or two, and they charge you $200 extra a month for a furnished room, you\u2019re still beating the system.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" data-attachment-id=\"11221\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/7-reasons-try-short-term-rental-nyc\/attachment\/furnished-room-short-term-rental\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/furnished-room-short-term-rental.jpeg?fit=1506%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1506,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"furnished-room-short-term-rental\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/furnished-room-short-term-rental.jpeg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/furnished-room-short-term-rental.jpeg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/furnished-room-short-term-rental.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"sofa lamp stand, and side table in a room of a pre furnished short term rental \" class=\"wp-image-11221\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/furnished-room-short-term-rental.jpeg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/furnished-room-short-term-rental.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/furnished-room-short-term-rental.jpeg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/furnished-room-short-term-rental.jpeg?w=1506&amp;ssl=1 1506w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><b>4. With a short term rental, you can get to know your community<\/b> better<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t snag a short term rental just anywhere. It pays big dividends to live in the same neighborhood you\u2019re thinking about moving to long term. Every neighborhood in NYC is unique. W<\/span>hile s<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ome have more parks, others have more shopping. I<\/span>n fact, s<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ome are a pretty spectacular blend of both. Certain communities are tighter knit than others. You\u2019ll pick up on which one\u2019s are more welcoming right away. Although New Yorkers are famous for many things<\/span>, b<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eing shy isn\u2019t one of them.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>5. You can experience your apartment complex around the clock<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best rental hacks is to get a short term rental where you are renting in the very apartment complex you want to stay at long term. A big problem with apartment searching in general is that things seem great when you tour the place on Wednesday afternoon. You move in Thursday, and all is well. Birds are chirping, people are singing. Then Friday night rolls around and you realize, you\u2019re living with the whackos Sons of Anarchy threw out for charges of unnecessary roughness. A short term rental lets you see what your prospective complex is like throughout the weekly cycle, so you don\u2019t get any nasty surprises.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>6. You can find jobs when in a short term renta<\/b>l<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York is famous for being rich in opportunity. In April of 2017, there were<\/span><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.labor.ny.gov\/stats\/nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,825,600 jobs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in private sector alone. But don\u2019t expect finding work to come easy. Or fast. However, a short term rental is one of the wisest rental hacks that lets you experience firsthand how marketable you are in such a fiercely competitive environment.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><b>7. You get to take your time<\/b> when in a short term rental<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might be tempted to maximize your savings by getting a hotel for a few days. B<\/span>ut p<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lease don\u2019t. Especially if it\u2019s your first time. New York is too big and complex to get an in depth understanding in such a short amount of time. Can a tourist have a great time in three days? Abso-positively. But being a tourist in any city and being a resident are two very different things. Moreover, if you get a hotel, you\u2019ll end up running around like Captain Crazypants and ultimately be left with an incomplete picture of what the city has to offer. In conclusion, a short term rental lets you really come to grips with New York Cities particular brand of epic.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you tried a short term rental in New York City?
