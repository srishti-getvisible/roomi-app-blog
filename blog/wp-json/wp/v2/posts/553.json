You want someone that shares your interests, pays the bills on time, is friendly and responsible. And definitely clean. That&#8217;s pretty much what makes a roommate you love living with, right?

Just think twice. The Roomi team put together a previous article that answers the infamous question, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/become-roommates-friend\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cShould I Become Roommates With My Friend?\u201d<\/a> There are pros and cons. Rooming with a friend has certain risks involved. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are more kinds of roommates in New York than Haagan Daaz has flavors of ice cream. And yes, there are some nuts sprinkled in. But ultimately, New York City has<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/planning\/data-maps\/nyc-population\/current-future-populations.page\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">roughly eight and a half million people<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in it, give or take a few hundred thousand. Somewhere out there is a good match for you that doesn\u2019t require you to take risks with a friendship. Probability is in your favor. C\u2019mon. That\u2019s just science.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Get to know prospective roommates in depth.<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t spend fifteen minutes on a decision that could last for a year. A roommate is a big commitment. Maybe not as big as buying a car, but way more serious than buying a moped. If you want a helpful list of things to build your questions around, head over to this article, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/7-things-check-find-roommate-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">7 Things To Check Before You Find A Roommate In NYC.\u201d<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Do more than one interview.<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk to a person several times. Preferably at different points throughout the week. Try them on a Monday after work, the middle of the week, and on a Saturday or Sunday. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of people can put a smile on their faces and hold it for fifteen minutes if they squeeze real tight. Not so many can maintain that throughout the week. New York City is overflowing with cool little caf\u00e9\u2019s. Meet them somewhere public and have a coffee. Multiple interviews will give you a much better idea of who this person is and whether or not you&#8217;re compatible with them.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Don\u2019t wait until you need to find a roommate before you start searching.<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If rent is right around the corner, you\u2019ll be panicked and prone to making a rash decision. This could backfire if you\u2019re new BFF can\u2019t actually pay rent and is hoping to find a job over the next month or several years, whichever comes first.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Use references and chat apps.<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chat apps can be a great way to get to know someone a little at a time.
