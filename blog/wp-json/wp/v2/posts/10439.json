But nevertheless, it\u2019s an important skill to have if you want to set yourself up for a good life. So, to help you get better at managing your finances, we\u2019re going to deal with a pretty serious-sounding topic: investment. We know, we know, investing sounds like something only fancy Wall Street executives do in their high-end (pant) suits. But if you\u2019re an adult with a source of income, there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t invest. Moreover, if you\u2019re at a stage where you want to find better ways of managing your personal finances, looking into investments is the way to go! So, here we go, let\u2019s learn a little about investing!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:74%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/ioopmOHLqIDfGxLLKG\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/ioopmOHLqIDfGxLLKG\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lessons-in-handling-your-finances-what-are-the-basic-types-of-investments\">Lessons in handling your finances: What are the basic types of investments?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re new to the world of investing, everything probably feels overwhelming right now. And that\u2019s <em>okay<\/em>. It will take a while before you can familiarize yourself with the different types of investment options available to you and if they\u2019re a good fit or not. So, rather than throwing a bunch of jargon at you, we thought we\u2019d make things a bit easier for you. Which is to say that today we\u2019ll be looking at three basic types of investments that are best suited for beginners handling their finances. Maybe you\u2019ve heard some of these before, maybe you haven\u2019t. But by the end of this, you\u2019ll definitely get a better understanding of the different options available to you and how each of these will help you in managing your personal finances! So, let\u2019s start with the most basic one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Financial Planning Basics: The 6 Golden Rules To Save Money<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-easiest-way-to-start-handling-your-finances-retirement-account\">The easiest way to start handling your finances: retirement account<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably weren\u2019t expecting 401(k) to show up on this list, but here we are. Investing through your employer is a great, low-risk way of handling your finances. For most employees, a retirement account is the first investment they make. Especially, if your employer matches a percentage of your contribution towards your fund. What\u2019s more is that there isn\u2019t generally, a minimum amount you need to contribute towards the fund. Pay whatever amount you&#8217;re comfortable with. Though it is recommended that you contribute at least enough to be able to claim the full employer match. So, if you\u2019ve just started managing your personal finances, definitely look into retirement funds. If you already have one, great! If you don\u2019t, reach out to HR to find out what your options are!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Roomi tip:<\/strong> If your employer doesn\u2019t offer a retirement plan (or if you\u2019re self-employed), don\u2019t worry! You can open an IRA account on your own. Go <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/r\/rothira.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here <\/a>to learn more! For those interested in diversifying their retirement savings, considering different asset classes can be beneficial.

A fixed-income investment is generally known as a bond. These bonds allow the investor to get a fixed-rate payment over a specific period of time. Bonds are offered by both companies and governments and is one of the largest markets out there. You can actually look at bonds as a loan that you are giving out to the government or a company. And you get a specific amount of interest back, called the coupon rate, in exchange for this loan. This interest is generally paid once or twice a year till the whole amount is paid off i.e. the bond reaches its maturity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning on holding onto the bond till it reaches maturity, you don\u2019t have to worry about your return on investment. You\u2019ll be fine. But if you want to further buy or sell your bond before its maturity, then the market fluctuations will affect you. Just remember this simple rule and you\u2019ll be fine- when interest rates increase, the price of the bond decreases, and as interest rates decrease, the price of the bond increases. If you\u2019re looking for a low-risk way of managing your personal finances, we definitely recommend fixed-income investments! So, if you&#8217;re just starting to think about handling your finances better, this could be your best bet!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-equity-investments-or-stocks\">Equity investments or Stocks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is probably what you were looking for when you clicked on this blog. Everyone\u2019s mind always goes to stocks when they hear the word \u201cinvestment\u201d. Which is just as well because equity investment is great for beginners. If you\u2019re not quite sure what they are, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ve just started managing your personal finances! In a nutshell, equity investments is the buying and selling of stocks of publicly traded companies. Which means, public trade companies sell shares to investors as a way to raise capital to expand their business. In return, the investors get equity interest in the company. Some companies also offer dividends to their investors for every stock they own, which adds extra value to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gainify.io\/top-investors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">top investors portfolio<\/a>, making them happy. If you\u2019d like to research and compare the companies that pay dividends, go to <a label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dividend.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Dividend.com<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:76%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3o6Mb3LoGITiGVGOly\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3o6Mb3LoGITiGVGOly\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you want to invest in stocks, you need to have an adequate understanding of the stock market. After all, if the company you\u2019re invested in is doing well, only then can you make a profit from the stocks you own. If you\u2019re thinking of equity investments, we recommend doing some market research beforehand. <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yahoo Finance<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Morningstar<\/a> can be really helpful to better understand how the market is behaving and what companies you should invest in!
