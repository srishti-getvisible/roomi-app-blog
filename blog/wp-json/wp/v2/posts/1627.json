Or your roommate starts listening to heavy metal on the speakers. With your neighbor whirring his power tools all day building his time machine, it&#8217;s only natural to feel like you&#8217;re just about spiraling out of control during the day in the era of remote work and jobs from home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you feel like working from home has left you somewhere in the middle between house chores and actual office work? Millions of Americans are a part of an unprecedented experiment in working from home because of Coronavirus. Although working from home has made many people happier, more efficient, and brought flexibility to their lives, the challenge to keep work and home separate still remains. With no one watching, there is no peer pressure and no communal obligations to get the job done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 5 tips that can help you achieve a work-home balance when you have remote work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Start early when working from home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a schedule and starting your day early is like setting the path right for a productive day when working jobs from home. Did you know that you would gain 15 days in a year if you woke up an hour early each morning?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>&#8220;It is well to be up before daybreak, for such habits contribute to health, wealth, and wisdom.&#8221;<\/p><cite>Aristotle<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting aside time in the morning with remote work, helps you focus and clears brain fog. And it also gives you time to eat a healthy breakfast, which will make you more efficient. You can channel your fresh energy into action and avoid the long commute to your office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"12377\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi\/attachment\/breakfast-when-working-from-home\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/breakfast-when-working-from-home.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"breakfast-when-working-from-home\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/breakfast-when-working-from-home.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/breakfast-when-working-from-home.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/breakfast-when-working-from-home.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a book, a bowl of porridge, and a cup of coffee on the bed\" class=\"wp-image-12377\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/breakfast-when-working-from-home.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/breakfast-when-working-from-home.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/breakfast-when-working-from-home.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choose a workspace<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because you have the leisure of remote work does not mean that you cannot have an office at home.

One effective way is to &#8216;block time.&#8217; Set aside a particular time before or after your job to finish big chores like washing the dishes, cooking, and sweeping. During your breaks, you can load\/unload the washing machine, do a 5 minute declutter, or wipe down the kitchen\/table counter. Giving yourself little tasks during breaks is a way to feel rewarded and is better than hitting your bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"12381\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi\/attachment\/working-chores\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/working-chores.jpeg?fit=819%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"819,1024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"working-chores\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/working-chores.jpeg?fit=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/working-chores.jpeg?fit=819%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/working-chores.jpeg?resize=819%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a girl arranging flowers in her kitchen\" class=\"wp-image-12381\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/working-chores.jpeg?w=819&amp;ssl=1 819w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/working-chores.jpeg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/working-chores.jpeg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers manage work and home, simultaneously?
