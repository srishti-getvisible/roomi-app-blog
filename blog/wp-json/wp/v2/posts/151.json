You have a presentation at work in the next couple hours, but you can\u2019t catch a wink. In brief, you have bad neighbors. Okay, great. But is there anything you can do about the bad neighbor&#8217;s behavior? Read on to know! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve all been there. Whether it\u2019s a group of loud college students partying every night, someone watching TV [very loudly] through until dawn, or the couple downstairs complaining about <em>you<\/em>&nbsp;every time&nbsp;you \u201cwalk too loudly,\u201d bad neighbors are everywhere. But before you get into an all-out housing war Seth Rogen- and Zac Efron-style, you might want to take a step back and evaluate the situation. Instead of being <em>that<\/em> passive aggressive person&nbsp;and burning bridges by leaving&nbsp;a note on your neighbor\u2019s door, try taking the high road. Here\u2019s how you deal with all types of bad neighbor&#8217;s behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The bad neighbors in the form of party animals<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter where you are, there\u2019s always that one neighbor who loves to throw a good rager on the weekend. Along with one too many happy hours during the week. You might even be friends with them or receive frequent invites to their gatherings. But when it\u2019s a Wednesday night and you\u2019re trying to catch up on some beauty sleep,&nbsp;the noise from your neighbor\u2019s last-minute mixer is the last thing you want to hear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though you could always call 311 and file a noise complaint about your bad neighbor&#8217;s behavior. Calmly speaking to your neighbor face-to-face is less extreme. And it&#8217;s best for avoiding tension between you and the person you see almost every day.&nbsp;Approach this&nbsp;person as&nbsp;you would your roommate, and tread lightly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIf you are friendly or comfortable with speaking to your neighbor, mention that their loud noise often keeps you up, and ask if they would mind lowering the volume of their music in a polite, neutral, non-confrontational manner,\u201d suggests Diane Gottsman, a national etiquette expert and owner of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.protocolschooloftexas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Protocol School of Texas<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if the situation escalates, and your neighbor continues to ignore your plea for quiet, Gottsman recommends discussing the issue with someone in charge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know [your neighbor], and are not comfortable addressing them personally \u2015 it may be for safety concerns or general lack of comfort level \u2015 allow the office management to handle the situation,\u201d Gottsman said. \u201cIt is their responsibility to offer a comfortable living environment for their renters.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The pet owners<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogs are man\u2019s best friends; they\u2019re loyal, sweet and pretty dang adorable. But when night rolls in&nbsp;and you\u2019re once again trying to drown out the howling and barking, it\u2019s easy to forget how lovable your neighbor\u2019s dog really is. And even though it&#8217;s not your bad neighbor&#8217;s behavior per se, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/reddit-tips-for-when-you-cant-sleep-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sleep deprived<\/a> you is not having it. But if you talk to your neighbor, chances are you may find your problem solved pretty easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christopher Sharp, a construction worker and dog owner, remembers being taken back when a neighbor reported his dog\u2019s barking without confronting him first. He admits he would\u2019ve rather had a conversation first rather than learn about the complaints later through the management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cI would have been perfectly happy if she would have just knocked on my door and dealt directly with me,\u201d Sharp says.<\/p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in going to the root of the problem and not beating around the bush. Most people I\u2019ve met choose to avoid any sort of confrontation. If I had a dime for every time I\u2019ve had to apologize for my dog\u2019s less than stellar behavior I\u2019d be eating lunch with Bill Gates.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Those who overstay their welcome become bad neighbors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people are just social butterflies. They can move from conversation to conversation with ease and have no trouble introducing themselves to strangers. In fact, they\u2019re the neighbors who bring baked goods to your door when you move in. Or they&#8217;re the ones who ask how your day was while passing you on the stairwell. Honestly, they\u2019re good people. So naturally, when they start walking into your apartment unannounced or have the habit of hanging out for hours on end, asking them to leave is difficult. These are the neighbors that are so great, you can\u2019t handle it anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the task might make you uncomfortable, ignoring everything will only last so long. The worst thing you can do is bottle up your frustration. And then blow up at your bad neighbor&#8217;s behavior later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cTalk to them and explain that you\u2019re a private person and enjoy being with people, but also being alone,\u201d licensed counselor and board-certified coach Terry Wynne says.<\/p><p>\u201cThen ask them to call you when they want to get together to see if you\u2019re even available. If the neighbor stays too long, assertively say, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, but I have some issues I have to address, and stand up and start walking toward the door. They\u2019ll get the hint.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"675\" height=\"900\" data-attachment-id=\"12062\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/co-living-101-making-nice-bad-neighbors\/attachment\/bad-neighbors-3\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/bad-neighbors.jpeg?fit=675%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"675,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bad-neighbors\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/bad-neighbors.jpeg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/bad-neighbors.jpeg?fit=675%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/bad-neighbors.jpeg?resize=675%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A sign on the wall that says 'Love your neighbor' because even your bad neighbor's behavior can be dealt with love. \" class=\"wp-image-12062\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/bad-neighbors.jpeg?w=675&amp;ssl=1 675w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/bad-neighbors.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The early risers and all-nighters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that a sound of someone hammering a nail into the wall at 7 a.m.? Why, yes it is. And just the other day, someone was practicing their guitar solo at midnight. It might seem obvious that making noise early in the morning or late at night isn\u2019t appropriate. But not everyone recognizes this unspoken rule. If this is the case, Wynne advises&nbsp;being proactive about setting up ground rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cAsk your noisy neighbors to be quieter at reasonable times such as when you\u2019re sleeping or late at night.&nbsp;If they continue to be noisy, check your apartment rules regarding noise regulations and curfews. If you don\u2019t have any, report the situation to your apartment\u2019s management. Then ask for a date by when they\u2019ll contact you with the corrective action they plan to take.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The family with a baby<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing\u2019s first: Babies cry and their parents are never to blame. With that said, we also can\u2019t blame you for being irritated when the wails are keeping you up every night. Unfortunately, this is a tough situation to be in since there\u2019s no way around a crying infant. And since complaining to the family will undoubtedly offend them. Being as understanding and helpful as you can will gain you some good karma.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cAs if new parents don\u2019t have enough to worry about. Living in tight quarters with a new baby that cries all night is an additional stressor,\u201d Gottsman says.<\/p><p>\u201cAssuming the parents are doing everything they can do to make their baby comfortable, and not letting her scream all day and night without caring for her (that would be a different topic \u2013 and 911 would be in order), invest in a pair of earplugs.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Gottsman further suggests offering to help parents in any way, especially if you have children of your own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cWhen you see the parents outside, you can mention that you hear the baby crying and offer some of your own baby soothing tips \u2013 perhaps a sound machine \u2013 letting them know you\u2019re aware of the crying, and give them a hint that you\u2019re up all night with the baby too.<\/p><p>\u201cIf all else fails, invest in your own sound machine and have a glass of wine before bed.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tattletales are the worst of the bad neighbors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Passive aggressive notes are a huge no-no! But having a neighbor complain to the landlord or supervisor about you isn\u2019t great either.  Especially when you\u2019re not sure what the problem is. While many people have reasons for reporting their neighbors, others just like to stir up drama for the hell of it. (Mr. Heckles, anyone?) Like the one mentioned below. Read on to know how to deal with this type of bad neighbor&#8217;s behavior. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>As irksome as it can be, do your best not to retaliate or confront them when you\u2019re angry. Instead, sit down with your neighbor and get their perspective on the situation, while letting them know that you\u2019re always open to conversation should a similar incident arise in the future. Your communication skills will take you far here. And if nothing else, talk to your management company and let them know you\u2019ve tried to resolve the issues to no avail. After all, your landlord\u2019s reference letter is the only one whose matters when you move.<\/p>\n<h2>The Mess Makers<\/h2>\n<p>If you live in a <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/6-things-to-consider-before-living-in-a-walkup\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">six-floor walkup<\/a>, you probably make it a point to go up and down the stairs as little as possible. We understand. Sadly, your neighbors might\u2019ve taken that to the extreme. And as you notice <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/what-happens-when-your-roommate-wont-take-out-the-trash\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">bags of trash pile up<\/a> outside their doorway, you\u2019ve finally had enough. Though you understand the burden of not living in a building with a garbage shoot, it doesn\u2019t stop you from keeping the place tidy.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cTell the person that you fear their trash might attract bugs <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/ask-roomi-help-how-do-i-get-rid-of-mice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">as well as rodents<\/a>&nbsp;with the trash they leave outside,\u201d Wynne said. \u201cAsk \u2014 don\u2019t demand \u2014 if they\u2019ll take the trash to the appropriate disposal method instead of putting themselves and you at risk for infestations.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>No one wants cockroaches infesting their apartment, and that very concept might\u2019ve slipped your neighbor\u2019s mind. So if you\u2019re tired of the constant trash smells or you\u2019re worried about what their mess might draw into the building, politely let them know how you\u2019re feeling. Still no luck? This is definitely an appropriate time to call your landlord.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers deal with bad neighbors?
