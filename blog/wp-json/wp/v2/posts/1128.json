They just moved into the place we&#8217;re currently living at about 5 months ago, and I, nearly 2 months ago. I&#8217;m not sure how she&#8217;s taken care of her dog prior to me moving in, but since I&#8217;ve started residing there, I&#8217;ve never seen her walk her dog. I voiced my opinion on this and suggested that she spend more time with him (even take him to work, as her workplace is dog-friendly). She obliged a couple times (maybe 3 times max since I&#8217;ve lived with her) and has spent maybe half a day to a full day once or twice (again, since I&#8217;ve moved in).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>As far as I&#8217;ve seen, Sarah doesn&#8217;t play with the dog at all but she keeps him in her room with her boyfriend as soon as she comes home until the next morning when she&#8217;s off to work\/wherever else.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3og0INJHs40dal3F0A\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3og0INJHs40dal3F0A\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets, and as annoying as it is for you, it&#8217;s worse for the pets. If, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Advice\/comments\/597xk5\/roommate_neglects_her_dog_what_should_i_do\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Reddit poster butwhythough1<\/a>, you\u2019re feeling sorry for your roommate\u2019s house-bound doggo, what can you do? You know owning a pet is a decision that\u2019s not to be taken lightly. That dog needs exercise, but you no longer want to resort to walking it yourself. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-so-what-do-you-do-when-your-roommate-doesn-t-take-care-of-their-pets\">So, what do you do when your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets? <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This sort of case isn\u2019t illegal. Just saying your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets won&#8217;t get you very far. So unless the neglect develops into something more extreme, the NYPD or an animal control agency won\u2019t be able to help. Instead, you\u2019ll have to voice your concerns to your roommate. So, make him\/her aware that dogs need to be walked. Provide numbers for local dog walkers if they don\u2019t have the time. Sometimes your annoying roommates only need a guiding hand to see the errors of their ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that\u2019s not an option, a careful conversation should help you determine what is. If they\u2019re struggling to find either the time or money to take care of your pet, it might be time to let go. Speak to them about finding another loving home that can give the animal the life it deserves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-your-roommate-s-pet-isn-t-potty-trained\">Your roommate\u2019s pet isn\u2019t potty-trained<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A cat that can\u2019t use the kitty litter. A dog that doesn\u2019t do its business outside. Doesn&#8217;t that sound like a nightmare to live with? An untrained pet starts to really affect your own quality of life. It\u2019s difficult to turn a blind eye when unpleasant animal scents waft their way into your nose every time you&#8217;re home. But just because your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets, doesn&#8217;t mean you need to live in a stinky apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/9m917p\/my_roommates_dogs_are_driving_me_crazy_i_dont\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Reddit poster readoldbooks<\/a> had a similar experience:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>\u201cMy roommate has a 1.5 year old Aussie Shepherd who constantly pees inside the house, EVERYDAY. She is taken outside every morning, around lunch, every evening, but still pees inside as soon as no one is watching her (even if I am home but in another room, she will pee on the house). She does nothing to alert that she needs to go outside. How can we train her?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/WdIaMQ6bLlvtm\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/WdIaMQ6bLlvtm\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Your response to this really depends on your own history with animals. If you\u2019re experienced with cats or dogs, you can guide them! You could actively help them train their pet or offer advice. If not, you\u2019ll find training guides and videos online to share with your annoying roommates. Avoid giving in and cleaning up the mess yourself. This will just let your roomi think they\u2019re off-the-hook and they could stop taking responsibility altogether. Bring the pee or poop to their attention immediately. And make sure the pet owner is keeping on top of any potential hygiene issues.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-if-the-neglect-is-more-serious\">What if the neglect is more serious?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets could be a sign of something much worse. So, if you\u2019re witnessing serious animal abuse, you need to do something about it. If talking things through doesn\u2019t yield the outcome you want, remember that as a cohabitant, you can report neglect. Keep a written diary of everything you experience &#8211; with dates, times and specific details wherever possible. Take photos that show the abuse. For example, take pictures of the pet and where its kept. Then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aspca.org\/take-action\/report-animal-cruelty\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report animal cruelty<\/a> to the appropriate organization. <\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:123%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/b6roFb3iFdoPu\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/b6roFb3iFdoPu\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers deal with annoying roommates who don&#8217;t take care of their pets?
