The report from February highlights the nationwide increase in renting. Moreover, there&#8217;s been subsequent decline of homeownership across multiple age groups in the last decade. Notably, older millennials are waiting&nbsp;longer than ever to take the leap into homeownership. They&#8217;re choosing rents over mortgages, unlike their parents\u2019 generation. So where to rent in Texas? More importantly how to find a room in Texas. Let&#8217;s find out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/dtCv7K2lwu48DUk1d7\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.giphy.com\/media\/dtCv7K2lwu48DUk1d7\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C236&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Texas Dallas GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"236\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not just Texas, but many American cities have seen impressive increases in renting in recent years. Las Vegas, for instance, is almost 50 percent renters. San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, and Austin are among the top&nbsp;cities whose residents are saying bye-bye to homeownership. However, it&#8217;s easy to find room in Texas, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/roommates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">even roommates<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s Happening?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The shift to rent became a nationwide trend following the financial crisis. Cities with the most foreclosures turned many homeowners into renters. And with services like <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roomi<\/a>,&nbsp;which offer a much safer and easier way to find room in Texas and around. Renting has never been easier. Las Vegas saw the biggest shift, with a 10 percent increase in renters between 2006 and 2014. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How I Bought My First Texas Rental Property\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tMma0Hxpc8U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in the case of many Texas cities, which fared reasonably well post-crisis, the bustling economy has contributed to the <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/5-myths-probably-believe-living-texas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">population explosion<\/a>.

This has lead to inflation in the rent in Texas. San Antonio tops the list of Texas cities with a 5.3 percent increase in renters since 2006.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty average compared to the other American metros, whose renter population ranges from 0.2 percent to 9.9 percent. But let&#8217;s compare to historically renter-heavy cities like <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rooms-for-rent-in-new-york-city\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New York City<\/a> &nbsp;and <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.zumper.com\/rooms-for-rent\/san-francisco-ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">San Francisco<\/a>. They saw a 3.7 percent and 3.3 percent increase, respectively, it puts the trend into perspective. Pair that with the fact that Texas property taxes are among <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chron.com\/homes\/article\/Texas-property-taxes-among-the-nation-s-highest-6181429.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">the highest<\/a> in the US, the increase in renting in Texas isn\u2019t surprising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What about rent in Texas?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"728\" data-attachment-id=\"12404\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/among-texas-millennials-homeownership-renting\/attachment\/living-in-austin-2-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-2.jpeg?fit=1829%2C1300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1829,1300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"living-in-austin-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-2.jpeg?fit=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-2.jpeg?fit=1024%2C728&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C728&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"apartments to find a room in texas\" class=\"wp-image-12404\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C728&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C546&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-2.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1092&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-2.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1114&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-2.jpeg?w=1829&amp;ssl=1 1829w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So how much does an average 4.4 percent increase in renters affect the state on the ground level? According to the report, the increase in renters and rent in Texas has spiked median rent prices. This is by a steep 29.2 percent in San Antonio. Even worse,&nbsp;Austin\u2019s 3.3 percent rise in renters has partially contributed to its whopping 31.8 percent increase in median rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone has felt the impact yet, however. San Antonio realtor John Giacobbe says in light of the city\u2019s population growth, sales have been steady. He notes that while rentals appear to be in high demand, so are homes for sale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cI think there are a lot of folks who are unable to qualify to purchase a home due to issues with their credit and down payment requirements,\u201d says Giacobbe.<\/p><p>\u201cThis is driving the demand for rental properties because it is the only option for many families to secure housing. I think the main issue behind not qualifying is that they\u2019re not saving and over-spending their money. The credit issues have continued the need for rentals, so there is still just as much of a demand in this market for rental properties as there are homes for residents to buy.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rooms-for-rent-in-austin-tx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Find Rooms For Rent In Austin, TX<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Should you Rent vs Buy a Home when Moving to Texas?\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rHucqqfVFaI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Giacobbe is not wrong about that. Trulia\u2019s report points out that lower-income residents have been affected the most by the loss of \u201cthe American dream\u201d, and they are still largely renters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But fellow Texan realtor and president of the Renters Warehouse in Dallas, Michael Park, argues that, at least, renting in Texas is a positive side effect of the state\u2019s healthy economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are Texans saying about rent in Texas?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cDespite all of the new construction going on around town, apartment builders simply can\u2019t keep up with the demand in our area caused by our strong job growth and our increasing population,\u201d Park says. \u201cAs such, we\u2019re seeing a rental boom in the DFW area \u2014 and many of the renters are Millennials.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Park explains that renting is an ideal option for residents who are recent graduates or young professionals beginning their careers, offering a low-risk, short-term commitment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Why I Did NOT Invest in Texas (Rental Property Market Analysis)\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ifWl58iSyoY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cMillennials saw what the Baby Boomer generation went through during the recession and housing crisis, and they\u2019re leery of getting tied-up with a mortgage. They want the convenience of knowing they can move easily and quickly, if needed. The renting stigma has also changed. In the past, if you rented, it was likely you couldn\u2019t afford to buy. But many of today\u2019s renters, or \u2018lifestyle\u2019 renters, can afford to own a home, but they choose not to, giving them the option to pay off debt or travel. In essence, you can\u2019t put a price on convenience nor the appeal of having an apartment or home that\u2019s maintenance-free. adds Park.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Rent in Texas?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Phil Mackie, 29, a digital analyst sporting a three-year renting record in the state can vouch for Park\u2019s theory. Though he admits his income would support a mortgage and he understands that buying a house is more of an investment. Mackie says \u201cit\u2019s not enough to sway me!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be tied down to a piece of property. If I wanted to up and move to Alaska or anywhere for that matter, I simply would as I am now,\u201d he says.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a mindset common to those in his age group, he argues. Homeownership also signals a loss of freedom. Particularly, to a generation whose independence to do whatever they want, whenever they want, is of the utmost importance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" data-attachment-id=\"12405\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/among-texas-millennials-homeownership-renting\/attachment\/living-in-austin-3\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-3.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1255&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1255\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"living-in-austin-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-3.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-3.jpeg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"buildings in texas for rent\" class=\"wp-image-12405\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-3.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1047&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/living-in-austin-3.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIf a career opportunity sprung up out of nowhere, or we are struck by an adventurous sense of exploring, we want to be able to pursue it.
