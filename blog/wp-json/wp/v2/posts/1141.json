Living with a roommate stealing your food is a phenomenon many of us are familiar with.

One of them just happens to get in the way of the small joy that is my food.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>He ate my frozen pizza. We had a little talk. He ate my pudding. We had another talk. He ate some more stuff. I mark literally anything I buy as my own. Even the milk and cheese have my name on it. And it happened again.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So I stopped putting food in the fridge. It started small with only buying things for the day but that got rather irritating. So I got the old little fridge my parents stored in their basement and hid it in my room. Currently none of my food is in the &#8220;community fridge&#8221;. But I was still a little frustrated about my missing puddings.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So for the last 3 weeks or so I get up at 2:30 am and raid the community fridge. I almost empty the milk. I eat 2 of 3 puddings. I stuff myself with cheese and ham until there is just one slice left.

And chances are you\u2019ll get there <em>pretty <\/em>fast! When this happens, here are some proactive steps you can take to keep your food away from hands that help themselves. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming you\u2019ve already spoken to the snack thief in question, you could try some of the following methods:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Find alternative storage for your food. Lock it up if nothing works!<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grab a lockable mini-fridge and keep all snacks that have a high steal quotient, in a drawer in your bedroom. These items are prime targets, especially if a roommate comes home drunk and starving! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a more drastic measure, check out fridge lockers that are available online. As extreme as this might seem, it sends the correct \u201cstay away\u201d message to all your roommates stealing your food. And can add a little humor to the situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Label your food. <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grab a Sharpie and get creative to protect your food from the roommate that&#8217;s stealing your food. Go beyond labels that just contain your name. Depending on the severity of the situation, scribble gentle messages like \u201cTomorrow\u2019s lunch &#8211; please don\u2019t eat!\u201d or the slightly more assertive: \u201cDO NOT TOUCH MY PAD THAI!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or our personal favorite: &#8220;Eating this Pad Thai makes you my mortal enemy.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mark your territory. <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No &#8211; don\u2019t pee on your food. Once your roommate is in eyesight, grab a carton of milk or a bottle of juice and drink straight from the bottle. For added effect, cough or sneeze violently before you take a sip.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be a good enough sign for any roommate that&#8217;s guilty of stealing your food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What can you say to that roommate stealing your food?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"8266\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/roommate-ate-food-turn-it-around\/attachment\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge-scaled.jpg?fit=1920%2C2560&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,2560\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge-scaled.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge-scaled.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge.jpg?resize=610%2C813&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"man wrapped in a white blanket standing in front of a fridge that's completely empty wondering if their roommate stole their food\" class=\"wp-image-8266\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge-scaled.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge-scaled.jpg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C2640&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-wrapped-in-white-blanket-standing-in-front-of-an-empty-fridge-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feeling like you\u2019ve already said and done all you can? Or just don\u2019t have the energy to lock up your groceries every other day? We get it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A roommate that takes the odd spoonful of coffee might not be an issue. But if your roommate&#8217;s stealing food <em>all <\/em>of time, you\u2019ve probably long had enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s time to have a talk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here are some conversation starters for that roommate stealing, so you can reclaim your rightful snacks:&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>\u201cHey Sophie, I know money has been tight lately, but I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d ask before eating my leftovers.

(You could even install hidden cameras in communal areas and let them know you have proof.) <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, one of you is going to need to find a new roommate, because you shouldn\u2019t have to suffer at the expense of an inconsiderate roommate. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure this sounds extreme, and while we don&#8217;t recommend resorting to this until things get really bad, if you&#8217;re having to miss meals because your roommate is stealing your food, by all means, report them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving might be a last resort, but feeling comfortable and secure in your own home is so important.
