So, sit back and watch us blow your mind with these amazing kitchen tips and hacks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Easy ginger trick: One of the greatest kitchen hacks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ginger is something that most of us have in our pantry. They add so much flavor to food and have so much nutritional value. Not to mention, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thespruceeats.com\/homemade-ginger-tea-3377239\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ginger tea<\/a> is one of God\u2019s greatest creations and we stand by that. But for how delicious they are, they can be quite a pain in the ass. I mean, peeling ginger is one of the most annoying things on the planet. I mean, a ginger root has so many nooks and crannies that peeling it takes <em>forever<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, here\u2019s one of our great kitchen tricks: Scrap the skin of the ginger with a spoon, don\u2019t bother doing it with a knife. And wherever it gets too tough\u2026 leave the skin on. There\u2019s no harm in consuming ginger skin, so why bother trying to get every bit of it off! Isn\u2019t that so liberating?!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Best way to Peel Ginger | One Minute Kitchen Hacks | RecipesRSimple\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tK7wwC6phcs?start=2&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/easy-healthy-budget-meals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Easy Healthy Meals On A Budget<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kitchen hacks for the soul: Peeling garlic<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re like us, you want to put garlic on everything.
