It&#8217;s okay if you no longer remember the motivation you had at the beginning of the pandemic. What we could all do with is some festive cheer! And yes, even today, you could host a party during the pandemic. Want to know how? Here&#8217;s your guide to social gatherings for those times when none of us can get out of our homes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it was any other time of the year, we would be asking you to stay away from hosting social gatherings. But it is <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/how-to-celebrate-enjoy-christmas-on-a-budget-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the festive season<\/a>, and we all need some time out before we start a new year. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We absolutely don&#8217;t condone breaking lockdown rules if your city is under strict rules. You should be only hosting social gatherings under permissible considerations.  <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you <em>must<\/em> throw a party during a pandemic, here are some dos and don\u2019ts you (and your guests) should strictly follow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bear in mind that these are awkward times, and everyone understands if you aren\u2019t exactly the most elegant host. The party is no longer about being pretty \u2013 it\u2019s about showing you care about keeping your guests safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Talk to guests before sending out invites to your party<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This step is now just as important as <em>planning<\/em> a party during the pandemic. While you can assure your invited guests that you\u2019re going to be as cautious as possible, be understanding if they decline your invitation. If they\u2019re excited to attend, give them a briefing of your pandemic-time party rules and (politely) tell them there will be no exceptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/virtual-christmas-party-ideas-for-2020-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Related: Virtual Christmas Party Ideas For 2020<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/Ig8DazSvwyvpnipldc\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/foilarmsandhog-foil-arms-and-hog-fah-companies-throw-a-party-Ig8DazSvwyvpnipldc\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Size matters, especially when hosting a social gathering indoors.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch the number of people you invite.

Other essentials include placing hand sanitizers, paper towels, and closed-lid bins in every room. Have soap, paper towels, and bins at every sink, too, to make your party during a pandemic a safe one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" data-attachment-id=\"5327\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/throwing-a-party-during-a-pandemic-dos-and-donts-roomi\/attachment\/po5\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/po5.gif?fit=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"po5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/po5.gif?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/po5.gif?fit=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/po5.gif?resize=500%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5327\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">And as for the food,<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you going to prepare the food yourself or order in? Avoid potluck, as that would increase the very risk you\u2019re trying to avoid. Also, avoid putting all food and drinks in one spot where everyone would have to congregate. The best idea is for you to serve the food yourself, maybe with a couple of dedicated helpers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sanitize your hands, wear gloves, and finish the serving in one go if possible. Use disposable paper plates, paper cups, and wooden cutlery if it makes you uncomfortable to do the dishes later. For the rest of the party, serve everyone their own plates of finger-food and dips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" data-attachment-id=\"5328\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/throwing-a-party-during-a-pandemic-dos-and-donts-roomi\/attachment\/po6\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/po6.gif?fit=480%2C270&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"480,270\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"po6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/po6.gif?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/po6.gif?fit=480%2C270&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/po6.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5328\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BYOB or nothing!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re planning to have drinks at your get-together, the party rule is everyone gets their own drinks.
