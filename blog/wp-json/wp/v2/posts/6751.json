Get your documents in order for an apartment in New York<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You will need to keep your proof of income or a letter of employment handy. Along with that, your tax returns, bank statement, and credit report. References from past landlords will make your chances better when finding an apartment in New York!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might also need a guarantor if you make lesser than the landlord&#8217;s required income. Or you could offer to pay more security if that settles it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. A roommate in need, is a good roommate indeed<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you like it or not, the only way to find a cheap apartment in New York is to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">get a roommate<\/a>. Roommates also help with the loneliness that may become your shadow in the big city that never sleeps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head on <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to apps and websites that help find the perfect roommate<\/a> to share rent, bills, and friendship!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Resolve all doubts before you say &#8216;this is the one&#8217;!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, no question is a stupid question. Any and every question you have should be resolved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have questions about pets or pests, feel free to pester tenants and building dwellers about each and every detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretend you&#8217;re making an <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/8-fascinating-documentaries-about-new-york-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NYC documentary<\/a> if you have to. But make sure you ask all questions that come to mind, instead of regretting them later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Don&#8217;t think you can leave it and come back to it later<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/cheapest-apartments-around-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">When you&#8217;ve found an apartment in New York that matches your budget<\/a>, your preferences, and when you can sort of imagine yourself living there, you should just go for it. Give in your documents and cheque\/security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the thing is, NYC is the place to be! And a thousand other people might be looking for a cheap apartment in New York at the same time as you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you leave something behind, you leave it for good. It won&#8217;t wait for you to make up your mind to move in. It will be taken by another New Yorker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NxrCjx1Cj3\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/7-reasons-try-short-term-rental-nyc\/\">How Getting A Short Term Rental In NYC Can Make Moving Easier<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How Getting A Short Term Rental In NYC Can Make Moving Easier&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog\" src=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/7-reasons-try-short-term-rental-nyc\/embed\/#?secret=NxrCjx1Cj3\" data-secret=\"NxrCjx1Cj3\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"oeXH642P6C\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/getting-to-know-nycs-ferry-system-roomi\/\">A Guide To Using New York&#8217;s Ferry: Tickets, Routes &#038; More!<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;A Guide To Using New York&#8217;s Ferry: Tickets, Routes &#038; More!&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog\" src=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/getting-to-know-nycs-ferry-system-roomi\/embed\/#?secret=oeXH642P6C\" data-secret=\"oeXH642P6C\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FaI4xGSTSk\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/making-perfectish-roommates-a-reality-roomi\/\">The Quest To Finding Your Perfect Soul-Roommate<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The Quest To Finding Your Perfect Soul-Roommate&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog\" src=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/making-perfectish-roommates-a-reality-roomi\/embed\/#?secret=FaI4xGSTSk\" data-secret=\"FaI4xGSTSk\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So you&#8217;ve finally decided to move to NYC!
