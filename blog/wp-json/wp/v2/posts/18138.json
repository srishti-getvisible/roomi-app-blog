When you add searching for a room to the mix, the task becomes even harder. Roommate finders exist to simplify the process, and Craigslist is one of the most popular roommate finders you\u2019ll find out there. But is Craigslist the best choice you can make? Well, you may be surprised to hear it&#8217;s not. Roomi is actually a much better craigslist alternative for roommates search tool for several reasons. In this article, we\u2019ll show you why Roomi is better than Craigslist and why it should be your first choice every time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid\">Pricing: Are these roommate finder apps free or paid?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3o6Mb88YI6lYSmuL0k\" title=\"cashier\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Despite how useful they are, it doesn&#8217;t cost an arm and a leg to use roommate finder apps. As a matter of fact, many roommate finder services are free. However, you must be careful as some of the free apps tend to attract scammers and spammers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Searching for a roommate on craigslist is free. People who need roommates put up a listing that you can access provided you have an account on the platform. You&#8217;ll be able to virtually browse through hundreds of listings until you find what you&#8217;re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this regard, Roomi is better than craigslist. This roommate finder app allows you to sign up and search for roommates for free too. However, these roommates have been curated based on your preferences so you don\u2019t have to browse tons of listings before finding a suitable roommate. Instead, you can narrow down your search using a range of filters to save time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, for a payment of $14.99 for the weekly plan or $29.99 for the monthly plan, you can enjoy even more benefits to simplify the process. Benefits like a profile boost, more listings, unlimited messaging, and background checks are all part of what you enjoy by paying a little extra.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust\">Security: Can these apps help me find roommates I can trust<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/26FPFoCdiPbuHrmlW\" title=\"safety\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Most people want an assurance of safety when they\u2019re moving to a new place. It&#8217;s the least that anyone should expect. However, after making sure that you&#8217;ve chosen a house in a safe neighborhood, it&#8217;s perhaps even more important to ensure you have a great roomie &#8211; one that you can trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could get guarantees that put your heart at ease right from when you\u2019re searching for a roommate? Well, the best roommate finders give you that choice in a variety of ways. Consider the following features that Roomi, a top craigslist alternative for roommates, offers to see how it does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verification of Roommate Contact Info<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time, Craigslist was not particular about contact verification in any form. Following adverse reviews and many incidents of scams on the platform, this roommate finder service now verifies your phone number. This is done to prevent users from spam and reduce scam attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Roomi considers user safety as a priority. As a result, the contact info of every user is obtained and verified. That way, if the matching algorithm pairs you with someone, you can be sure the person is who they say they are at the very least. On request, Roomi can also conduct a background check on potential roommates for a little extra fee. This makes Roomi a great craigslist alternative for roommates, especially if you&#8217;re new to the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"id-verifications-for-potential-roommates\">I<strong>D Verifications for Potential Roommates<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening an account does not require ID verification for potential roommates on Craigslist. Despite being one of the largest roommate finders out there, it also has the highest number of scammers and fraudsters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because craigslist alternative for roommates, Roomi, is committed to guaranteeing a unique experience for its users, it factors in what makes for a more secure experience. IDs of potential roommates are verified and the information is kept securely in their database.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"privacy-security-of-profiles\"><strong>Privacy &amp; security of profiles<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Privacy is not the strongest point of Craigslist. Rooms and roommates that are listed on the website and in your locale are put on display. This information is available to any user on the web and so fraudsters use it to gather emails and phone numbers. If you like your privacy and are particular about protecting your information online, finding roommates on Craigslist probably isn&#8217;t for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this regard, Roomi is again better than craigslist as there is more privacy and security of profiles on Roomi. In fact, in this respect, it is easily the best roommate finder there is. Using the Globalid service, user information is verified, kept private, and secured. Plus you have total control of your information and can choose what to remove or add as you wish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"24-7-support-content-moderation\"><strong>24\/7 Support &amp; Content Moderation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Craigslist alternative for roommates, Roomi, has an in-house content moderation team that provides 24\/7 support for its users. The content team monitors activity in the background to ensure the service runs smoothly and users are prevented from any scams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"criminal-background-check\"><strong>Criminal Background Check<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that even necessary? If it will add to your sense of security, then it is worth it. This option is not available when you search for roommates on craigslist. Still wondering why Roomi is the best roommate finder? Roomi has the option to carry out a criminal background check for a small fee if you\u2019re on the free plan. Information about registered users is available on request and is verified against global and local criminal databases to determine any criminal history. While it is not 100% foolproof, it\u2019ll at least assure you that your roommate is not a fugitive on the run from the law!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"user-profiles-which-app-make-it-easier-to-find-your-perfect-roommate\">User Profiles: Which App Make It Easier to Find Your Perfect Roommate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3o6Zt1NiH0UJPOaYdW\" title=\"profile\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>There are many roommate finders out there, but the easiest way to find your perfect roommate is through Roomi. The cluttered interface on Craigslist alone can be enough to put you off. Perhaps, this can be explained away by the volume of listings and people. However, it still doesn&#8217;t change the fact that finding a roommate on Craigslist is not the easiest task. Even when you find a potential fit, you\u2019ll still have to conduct interviews to see if their preferences match yours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, craigslist alternative for roommates, Roomi, has an interactive UI\/UX design that is easy to navigate both on the web platform and the app. The app is also available on both android and iOS to bring access to your fingertips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to create similarly intuitive and engaging digital experiences, partnering with a <a href=\"https:\/\/flatirons.com\/services\/ui-ux-design-company-colorado\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Colorado UX design agency<\/a> can make a significant difference. These agencies specialize in crafting user-friendly interfaces that not only look appealing but also enhance functionality across multiple devices and platforms.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Craigslist tries to bridge the gap by encouraging you to fill in as many details as possible so you can let people know what kind of roommate you&#8217;re looking for. However, given the lack of privacy, putting your information out there on the internet may not be the wisest thing to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi presents a better alternative to searching for roommates on craigslist. Its multi-filters allow you to set various preferences for your roommate, so you can be more specific in your description. You can choose roommates across a particular age range by setting the age filter. There&#8217;s also has an LGBTQ-friendly filter, a house rules filter, and lots more. You&#8217;ll just have to try it yourself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/roommates?utm_source=roomi-blog&amp;utm_medium=owned-content&amp;utm_campaign=apartment-hacks&amp;utm_content=craigslist-alternative-choose-best-roommate-finder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Find Roommates<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"so-which-is-the-best-roommate-finder-for-you\">So, which is the best Roommate Finder for you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving to a new city is challenging. Searching for a roommate that suits your preferences perfectly adds another layer of complexity to it, but the best roommate finders simplify the process. Roomi prioritizes the client\u2019s safety, security, and privacy even in the search for a roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when compared with the generic Craigslist, Roomi is surely the best <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/roommates?utm_source=roomi-blog&amp;utm_medium=owned-content&amp;utm_campaign=apartment-hacks&amp;utm_content=craigslist-alternative-choose-best-roommate-finder\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">roommate finder<\/a> for you.
