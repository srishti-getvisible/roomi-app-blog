Your roommate is definitely pissed and is probably drifting from you emotionally. Perhaps you were once best of friends &#8211; two peas in a pod. But something has changed, and now your roommate is refusing to even talk to you. If you&#8217;re wondering what changed, here&#8217;s a list of things that could be causing those problems with your roommates.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/UTX8UTKmpjQgo\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/UTX8UTKmpjQgo\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6 Common Problems With Roommates &amp; Their Solution<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Your behavior is inappropriate<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the reason your roommate isn&#8217;t talking to you is because of the inappropriate comments you pass casually, without even realizing you&#8217;re doing it. Perhaps you made some racist remarks, or made comments about their sexuality, or made fun of them\/the things they do. Even if you meant no harm, chances are that your roommate is hurt or upset with your behavior. Ask them what&#8217;s bothering them and why are they being cold towards you. If you ask sincerely, your roommate will open up. Respect their feelings and make amends.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:83%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/Z9J8KOpedOxnmVsxXI\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/Z9J8KOpedOxnmVsxXI\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/a-guide-to-shared-living-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Related: A Guide to Shared Living: Getting Along with Your Housemates and Accepting Their Habits<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. One of the most common roommate problems &#8211; You owe them MONEY!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did your roommate lend you money that you haven&#8217;t returned yet? Are they paying for your share of groceries\/food or bills? Think hard! If there have been such instances, then your roommate&#8217;s behavior towards you is justified. Most roommate troubles are centered on the unequal distribution of chores and money. Clear debts with your roommate, and always keep a tab, especially when your roommate is covering for you. Nobody likes a person who forgets to pay up.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/WqQj26VjiryzT7G2ll\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/WqQj26VjiryzT7G2ll\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-divide-chores-with-your-roommate-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Related: The Ultimate Way To Divide Chores While Keeping All Harmony Intact<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Your roommate is introverted<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your roommate could be a shy and quiet person who likes to read more and talk less. It&#8217;s in their nature, buddy &#8211; you can&#8217;t hold it against them. Give them time and space to open up to you, and by no means try to force a conversation on them. It will only make things worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:141%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/ihZE96PwPf2UMYbnZ5\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/ihZE96PwPf2UMYbnZ5\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Another one of the most common roommate problems: You owe them an apology!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You had a crazy fight with your roommate last week, and ever since, they&#8217;ve been giving you the silent treatment. If your half-hearted apology hasn&#8217;t sorted this situation, maybe it&#8217;s time to sit like adults and talk about what&#8217;s bothering each of you. If they&#8217;re acting like a big old baby, take the initiative to start this discussion. Nobody likes a cold environment at home * shudders *.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:60%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/GjR6RPcURgiL6\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/GjR6RPcURgiL6\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Your roommate is going through something personal<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re an overthinker, you probably might be beating yourself up thinking &#8211;&nbsp;<em>Why is my roommate not talking to me? What did I do now?<\/em>&nbsp;It could be that you&#8217;ve done nothing wrong, and the issue lies somewhere else entirely! Perhaps they&#8217;re having a bad day, difficulties at work, are going through family or relationship strains. While you guys are thick and always discuss your problems, this time, they&#8217;re not ready to talk about it <em>(at least not right now)<\/em>. Give them their space and tell them that you&#8217;re there for them whenever they&#8217;re ready.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/xEsdRSsp9cR0s\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/xEsdRSsp9cR0s\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/taking-coronavirus-precautions-with-roommates-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Related: How to Live with Roommates In The Age of Coronavirus<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Maybe the real roommate problem is that they don&#8217;t like you<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This might sting <em>(a lot!)<\/em>, but hey, their behavior doesn&#8217;t define you. Your roommate may have suddenly decided that you two have nothing in common and perhaps shouldn&#8217;t talk.

However, to keep your house warm, lively, and away from negativity &#8211; promote the culture of open dialog.
