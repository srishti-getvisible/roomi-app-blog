I mean, how could it not be? You\u2019re meeting new people, in a new city (maybe even <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/find-room-new-york-city\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New York City<\/a>?!) <em>and<\/em> you\u2019re away from the comfort of your home! It\u2019s kind of like an adulthood version of throwing yourself into the deep-end of the pool, and waiting to see if you sink or swim. Of course, it\u2019s not all scary. You\u2019ll make lifelong friends, have profound experiences and a whole lot of memories! And one of these profound experiences is the one that involves you living with a stranger. Y\u2019know, your roommate? Your college roommate, conflict and all, will always hold a special meaning for you. And as fun as it is to have someone to share this whole new experience with, roommate problems are bound to arise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, today, we thought we\u2019d talk about how to deal with conflicts that arise when you\u2019re living with a college roommate for the very first time. Don\u2019t worry, most problems are fixable if you both have the right tools. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to help with!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/PLHdpauwfN2MvHcHxL\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/PLHdpauwfN2MvHcHxL\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-resolve-conflicts-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Resolve Conflicts When You Share an Apartment<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Resolve any conflict with your college roommate with an agreement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know agreement sounds like such a formal word. I mean, that\u2019s something you sign when you\u2019re an <em>adult <\/em>adult and want to buy a New York City penthouse or something. But you\u2019d be surprised by how much this helps. Of course, this document is not legally binding, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not effective! Writing down your wants, needs and expectations from your roommate (and vice versa) can really set the right tone for your relationship. Trust us, you\u2019ll feel like you know your new roommate a lot better after reading this agreement. And when conflict inevitably arises with your college roommate, you can just refer back to this agreement. <em>This <\/em>is how you deal with roommate problems in a healthy way!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/1xVdB2LjBz10whDJiQ\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/1xVdB2LjBz10whDJiQ\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Communication is key when dealing with college roommate conflict<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know, confronting a new college roommate might seem like a bad idea. After all, you want to be friends with your roommate, not accuse them of causing problems. But that\u2019s just it, honest communication isn\u2019t confrontation (Of course, if you decide to scream all your problems in their face, it won\u2019t help). But if you (kindly and gently) let your roommate know when they do something you don\u2019t like, they\u2019ll try to accommodate you. They probably didn\u2019t mean to piss you off on purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to sound too much like a marriage counselor, but communication really is the key to most of your problems. A conflict with your college roommate will only escalate if you don\u2019t communicate with them. What is a mild annoyance today, <em>will<\/em> become <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verywellmind.com\/the-stress-of-poor-communication-with-others-4154175\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unbearable<\/a> when you\u2019re both stressed out about final exams later in the semester. So, nip it in the bud and your dorm room will be a safe haven for both of you!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/YplQ3xdAQKHyHV9fxK\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/YplQ3xdAQKHyHV9fxK\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t point fingers at them<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re just going to keep the marriage counselor vibe going for just a second longer and give you this one advice: don\u2019t put all the blame on them. When you start pointing fingers at them and blame them for all your problems, they will get <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tonyrobbins.com\/love-relationships\/words-matter-you-vs-i\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">defensive<\/a>. This is actually advice that doesn\u2019t just help you deal with your roommate problems, but problems with every other person. The moment people get defensive, they start (verbally) attacking back and that just doesn\u2019t lead to anything good. And if your opponent is an 18 year old New York City college student, <em>oh boy<\/em>. So, maybe you should try telling them how their actions made you feel instead of telling them they\u2019re irritating and a bad roommate. Sensitivity is key when dealing with a conflict with your college roommate!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/6-shared-apps-for-roommates-to-maintain-peace-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">6 Shared Apps for Roommates to Help Keep Your Apartment A Conflict-Free Zone<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If nothing else works, it\u2019s time to call in the RA<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sofi.com\/blog\/pros-cons-of-being-an-ra\/#:~:text=A resident assistant or resident,the residents of a dorm.&amp;text=Sharing information about the residence,campus activities%2C and available resources.\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Resident Advisor<\/a> (or RA) might seem annoying when they\u2019re enforcing \u201cquiet hours\u201d and telling you all the different ways in which you\u2019re breaking University rules. But when it comes to mediating a conflict with your college roommate, they\u2019re godsent. If your roommate problems persist and nothing seems to solve it, it may be time to call in your RA. Shoot them an email, or text (or snapchat, if y\u2019all are cool) and let them know of the situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there you can decide what action to take. Maybe the RA can meet with both of you one-on-one or perhaps a group session might be helpful. Whatever it is, an outside mediation can really put things into perspective.&nbsp; In the rare cases where nothing seems to work and you just can\u2019t live with your roommate anymore, they might even help you switch rooms. Though this is a lot harder to do once the semester is already half-way done.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:68%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l0MYD43wCIJQyTlXW\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l0MYD43wCIJQyTlXW\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>College life will throw you in a lot of situations that are less than ideal. That includes unpleasant roommates, but don\u2019t let that ruin the whole experience for you. Honestly it actually might be good practice for if you ever move to New York City. Just remember, your roommate is only part of the college experience. And if you just can\u2019t get along with them, there\u2019s always a next semester!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers resolve conflicts with their college roommate?
