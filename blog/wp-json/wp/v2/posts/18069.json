Sounds like a familiar story? We know how tough it can be. So, we\u2019ve brought together a series to help you learn which app is the best fit for you. If you\u2019ve been wondering \u201cIs Roomgo a legit website to find rooms?\u201d This is a must-read for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/moving-in-together-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Moving In Together?

It\u2019s a challenging task to find out which is the best room finder out there. Here, we\u2019ve listed a number of features that are important to ensure that you have an excellent room finding experience. Let\u2019s find out how well Roomgo and its alternative, Roomi, both fare!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:52%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/xUPGczqZJtI3AbZZkI\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/tiny-house-hunters-mom-xUPGczqZJtI3AbZZkI\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"no-fee-apartments\">\u2705No fee apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi and Roomgo allow you to list your room for free. On Roomgo, you can indicate the number of rooms available for rent while creating the listing. According to some Roomgo reviews, however, you may need to upgrade to a premium plan to get more matches on your listing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pet-friendly-apartments\">\u2705Pet-friendly apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi and Roomgo allow you to indicate whether the room that you\u2019re listing is pet-friendly. When trying to find rooms for rent on Roomgo, you can filter the available rooms based on this feature. On Roomi, you can also quickly filter your options to find rooms which are happy to accommodate your furry friend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subletting\">\u2705Subletting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi and Roomgo allow you to list only the available rooms instead of the entire apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi allows listers to have at least 2 active listings to make it easier to advertise the available rooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While trying to find rooms for rent on Roomgo, you can indicate whether you\u2019re advertising as the landlord or as a roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/cohousing-communities\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Is Living In Cohousing Communities For You? Let\u2019s Find Out<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities\">\u2705Filtering rooms based on amenities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi understands that each user has different needs. Hence, this room finder app encourages users to filter room according to the amenities that they require, to get them closer to finding the room of their dreams. Based on this feature, Roomi is definitely a preferred Roomgo alternative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though listers have to specify the amenities available, when trying to find rooms for rent on Roomgo, users aren\u2019t able to filter according to the amenities they prefer. That could mean more time spent endlessly scrolling through listings that aren&#8217;t right for you. And that&#8217;s time you could be spending picking out your new plant, is it not?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type\">\u2705Filtering rooms based on Listing Type<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi allows users to quickly filter through the listing type. If you\u2019re comfortable with shared rooms, you can only view related listings. It\u2019s easy to browse through rooms which are tailored to your preference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomgo allows users to filter according to house type, though you only get to filter based on your preference for a home or an apartment. However, unlike Roomi, you cannot filter based on preferences for renting an entire place or opt out of shared rooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/what-are-micro-apartments\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What Is A Micro Apartment, and Why You Should Learn More<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules\">\u2705Filtering rooms based on House Rules<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another unique feature that Roomi offers but is not yet available on Roomgo, is the ability to filter rooms according to house rules. This feature is crucial when you\u2019ve specific needs such as a non-smoking roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features\">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNothing is free\u201d, but does that hold true when you\u2019re trying to find the best room finder app? When you\u2019re trying to find the best website to find rooms for rent, you may not always have to shell out cash to find the perfect match.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi\u2019s free plan offers a variety of features that suit most listers down to the ground. However, you can do more when you subscribe to Roomi Gold for $29.99 per month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomgo\u2019s monthly plan is $24.00 which unlocks a lot more features than the basic plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"allowing-free-listings\">\u2705 Allowing Free Listings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All Roomi users can have at least 2 active listings at any time. You can increase it to 5 by susbscribing to the Roomi Gold membership, or buying listing credits. When you buy listing credits separately, you can have up to 50 active listings on your profile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomgo allows multiple free listings on their platform as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-app-messaging\">\u2705 In-app messaging<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi makes it easy to connect with listers &#8211; even those on the basic plan can securely send messages to listers via the in-app messaging system. With a Roomi Gold membership, however, you can unlock unlimited in-app messaging which helps you get to know your lister (and potential roommate) better. So don\u2019t hesitate to reach out and nab the place of your dreams before it\u2019s too late!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Roomgo, you can only contact a limited number of people when you\u2019re on the basic plan. Though you can indicate your interest for free, you can only message listers if at least one of you has a premium account. Upgrading your account allows you to contact a lot more people and even check who\u2019s viewed your profile or listing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible\">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the most important feature when trying to find the best room finder app? It\u2019s the security features that help safeguard your privacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi verifies their listers\u2019 contact details to ensure that you only get to see the legitimate listings as you scroll. Think something\u2019s wrong with a particular listing? It\u2019s easy to report them to alert Roomi\u2019s content moderation team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Roomi an incredible Roomgo alternative are the safety features on offer. Though both Roomi and Roomgo have a content moderation team that verifies listings, Roomi takes it one step further by offering various verification levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Roomgo allows users to report listings, they do not verify contact details for listers or those who are trying to find rooms. Additionally, when listers upgrade to a premium plan, other users can see their number and listing address, even when they\u2019re on the basic plan. Hence, you\u2019ve got to be a little cautious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/faq\/is-roomi-free-to-use\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Is Roomi free to use?<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you\">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/AAL0WeeJyknhC\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/AAL0WeeJyknhC\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re moving to a new city for a job or uni, you\u2019re already bogged down with work. Who has the time to read through every listing to see whether they have the features you need? A good room finder should help you find a room that fits your needs, as soon as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Roomgo has some great features as well, it definitely falls short in some departments. Contacting listers, filtering rooms, and even knowing whether the listing on Roomgo is legit is a bit of a challenge. Without an air-tight verification system, it\u2019s hard to know whether you\u2019ll end up with a credible offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, Roomi delivers all this and more, making it an excellent Roomgo alternative! You can not only filter rooms based on the amenities, but according to house rules as well. It is easy to see whether it\u2019s a sublet apartment, or you get the entire place to yourself as well. With Roomi\u2019s safety features, you\u2019re assured that all listings are legitimate and that you\u2019re not wasting your time on a scam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"has-white-background-color has-background-dim-100 wp-block-cover__gradient-background has-background-dim\"><\/span><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignfull is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"5969\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/shared-apps\/attachment\/roomi-app\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=1600%2C1066&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1066\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Roomi-App\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Roomi-App-best roommate finder\" class=\"wp-image-5969 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size\"><strong>Roomi is your one-stop option to list or find rooms, find roommates to settle into a new city easily.
