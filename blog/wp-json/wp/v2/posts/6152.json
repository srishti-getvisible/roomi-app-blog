So we want to help you find the best furniture on a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/5-tips-on-how-to-save-money-while-living-in-nyc-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">budget when living in NYC.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said that, we also believe that furniture is a tricky investment. Only saving money shouldn&#8217;t be your priority. While affordable furniture is feasible, you need to put in the right amount of research that matches your budget but also doesn&#8217;t wear down in a couple of months.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while you try and buy furniture on the cheaper side, you should be willing to give a price for something that will sit well in your apartment and last long, even when you have to move out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go for something affordable, yet sturdy and be willing to save for a later buy instead of buying cheap and bad quality furniture in a hurry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s get to it. Here are some of the best places you can find your dream furniture on a budget when living in NYC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">NEW FURNITURE<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. IKEA<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Chances are you are tired of shopping from IKEA and wish to move beyond it. But the thing is when it comes to cheap and sturdy furniture, IKEA is one of the best bets for people living in NYC looking to spend less. The assembling of the furniture is hard work, yes, but if saving money is what you&#8217;re looking at, IKEA would surely top the list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it like this, you could make it a fun activity to do with your roomis!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/b1\/83\/b1\/b183b1abf219e6bc18c5acf8f127abe8.jpg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dresser from IKEA\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\">pinterest.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.
