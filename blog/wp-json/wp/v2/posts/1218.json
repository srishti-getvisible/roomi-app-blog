What does subletting mean though? Isn&#8217;t it the same as renting? What happens to your security deposit you have damages when you sublet? What are the subletting laws in New York like?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it simply, when you are subletting a room from the leaseholder, you won\u2019t sign on the lease.

So, how does this work, really?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, instead of signing an agreement with the owner or property manager, you\u2019ll make your own agreement with the leaseholder.

Especially where people can\u2019t afford to take on entire homes or apartments due to the price. Instead, they use apps like <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roomi<\/a> to find roommates to join them on a short-term non-fixed basis. This comes in handy if you&#8217;re thinking of splitting the rent and take off a little strain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nycbar.org\/get-legal-help\/article\/landlord-tenant\/subleases-and-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New York State Law<\/a> allows most tenants to legally sublet their room or apartment. They do, however, have to get written permission from their landlord in order to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And rightly so, there are certain rules around this. For instance, you can\u2019t sublet if you\u2019re living in a rent-controlled apartment. So it&#8217;s best to do your research before you advertise a spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do I need to pay a security deposit to sublet?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"7920\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/who-is-responsible-damages-when-sublet\/attachment\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"man wearing green shirt counting dollars of 50 and 20 in both hands for his security deposit\" class=\"wp-image-7920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1320&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/man-counting-his-security-deposit-money-when-subletting-in-new-york-scaled.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before moving in, most leaseholders will require you to pay a security deposit. This could also potentially include a month or two of rent.  This ensures accountability and that you don\u2019t move out with zero notice or ruin anything in the apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll probably need to sign a sublease agreement that will be shared between you, the head leaseholder and the landlord. This includes your names, proposed length of sublease, rent, security deposit and maybe your reason for subletting. The length of a sublease must be more than 30 days and less than two years within a four-year period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is liable for damages when you sublet?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"7922\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/who-is-responsible-damages-when-sublet\/attachment\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"damaged apartment window in white on a white concrete wall with one of the glasses out of 9 divisions, broken\" class=\"wp-image-7922\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1320&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/damaged-window-in-a-sublet-apartment-scaled.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, the people or persons on the main lease are liable for any damages made to the property and are financially responsible for making sure the rent is paid on time every month. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/sublease-apartment-new-york-city\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">That\u2019s why renters want to be sure they\u2019re taking on a sub-letter they can trust.<\/a> (That, and wanting someone they get along with.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a sub-letter and you accidentally damage something (these things happen), you may lose some of your security deposit. Usually, the terms and conditions around this will be outlined in your sublease agreement. The best advice here is to respect the home you\u2019re living in and the contents within it, or you could see your sublease being cut short and things can get awkward if you refuse to pay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short &#8211; the original tenant is responsible for damages. However, many sub-letters offer to cover the cost of the damage they caused, and some subleases may contain information regarding this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can I automatically take over the lease?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If everything is going smoothly with your new apartment and don&#8217;t have any damages from when you sublet (kudos!), <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you may want to take over the lease <\/a>when the current tenant is ready to leave. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In New York, however, there\u2019s no provision that allows you to do this automatically.
