And that <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">giv<\/span>es<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you a nice view of the surrounding area. The stoops are typically well swept, clean, and organized. Additionally, the slower pace of the Ridgewood neighborhood is reflected in the easy-going conversations between people relaxing on the stoops and talking with their neighbors. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes<\/span><a label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/03\/06\/realestate\/ridgewood-queensan-affordable-alternative.html?module=Endslate&amp;region=SlideShowTopBar&amp;version=EndSlate&amp;action=Click&amp;contentCollection=Real%20Estate&amp;slideshowTitle=Living%20in%20Ridgewood%2C%20Queens&amp;currentSlide=Endslate&amp;entrySlide=1&amp;pgtype=imageslideshow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">35 minutes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get to Rockefeller Plaza and to Union Square or Wall Street from the Ridgewood neighborhood.
