You landed a great job, found a fun roommate, and are navigating the city like a scene out of the Mary Tyler Moore Show. Suddenly, you notice something across the street at a nearby cafe. Is it them? Are they here to&nbsp;surprise you? As you raise your hand to wave and walk closer to the cafe, you realize you\u2019re mistaken. You don\u2019t know those people. And even worse, the knot builds in your throat, you realize you miss home \u2014 you really miss home. And now you need to find a new home away from home. Don&#8217;t worry though. We&#8217;ve got your back. Here&#8217;s all about finding a new home in the midst of homesickness. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, it\u2019s OK to feel this way, regardless of how old you are and how long you\u2019ve lived here. We all have moments when we long for comfort, stability, and familiarity. They\u2019re natural reactions to change when you&#8217;re finding a new home elsewhere. And while change can sometimes be uncomfortable, it\u2019s totally manageable. Luckily those homesick feelings, says Dr. Frank Sileo, a New Jersey-based psychologist and Executive Director of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.drfranksileo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Center for Psychological Enhancement, LLC<\/a>, won\u2019t last forever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cMoving to a place like New York City can be overwhelming, and it\u2019s common for people to fill their own heads with negative thoughts about whether they will ever fit in or adapt,\u201d says&nbsp;Sileo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPositive thinking is important, and we must remind ourselves that this is a short-term situation and inserting ourselves into a new community takes time.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Know that you\u2019re not alone on your quest of finding a new home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the wave of homesickness hits, take comfort in knowing you\u2019re not the only fish out of water \u2014 far from it. New York City <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyc.gov\/html\/dcp\/html\/census\/popcur.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gained more residents<\/a> between April 2010 and July 2014 (about 316,000 people!) than any other U.S. city. The immigrant population has also doubled since 1965, and 37 percent of New Yorkers are from abroad \u2014 and that\u2019s not even counting the number of people who have moved here from out-of-state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, know that you\u2019re not alone even when you feel alone when you&#8217;re on the quest of finding a new home in a foreign city. Cities like NYC are an expat\u2019s paradise, and you should feel better knowing you\u2019re among countless people experiencing the same challenges of adjustment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Talk to someone in your shoes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another step towards getting over homesickness is to talk about how you\u2019re feeling when finding a new home in a new city. Don\u2019t sulk alone \u2014 connect with others! Not only will it get your mind off your troubles, it\u2019s also&nbsp;been proven that shared human experiences can both mentally and physically make us feel better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cAs children, when we feel homesick, the common reaction is to cry and run to \u2018mommy\u2019 or \u2018daddy.\u2019 But as adults, we hesitate to express certain emotions or may feel embarrassed,\u201d Sileo says.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t have to shut yourself off from those back home when you find a new home. But don\u2019t rely on them entirely to get you through your transition, either. Try to keep busy, advises Sileo, and find people in your shoes to bond with \u2014 like your roommate. More than likely, you share a lot more in common than you think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask your roommate about their favorite family traditions, or what they love best about where they\u2019re from. Sharing these experiences with one another can help create understanding and trust between you and help you when you&#8217;re finding a new home in a foreign city. It could also lead to an unforgettable road trip to your roommate\u2019s home town \u2014 a place you may have never thought to visit otherwise!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"638\" data-attachment-id=\"12052\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/finding-new-home-midst-homesickness\/attachment\/finding-a-new-home-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/finding-a-new-home.jpeg?fit=1403%2C874&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1403,874\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"finding-a-new-home\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/finding-a-new-home.jpeg?fit=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/finding-a-new-home.jpeg?fit=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/finding-a-new-home.jpeg?resize=1024%2C638&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"3 people standing against the fence. one boy is looking for something on the phone while two girls wait. \" class=\"wp-image-12052\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/finding-a-new-home.jpeg?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/finding-a-new-home.jpeg?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/finding-a-new-home.jpeg?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/finding-a-new-home.jpeg?w=1403&amp;ssl=1 1403w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make new memories when finding a new home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part about moving to a new city is having the opportunity to make new memories. Brainstorm with your roommate how you both can recreate some of your favorite memories or traditions in your new home. Try attending an alumnae game-watching party, spending time getting crafty for your apartment, or preparing your favorite meals. For the foodies, a homey dish can be everything to help you feel comfortable when you&#8217;re finding a new home. And it\u2019s the perfect centerpiece to your social gatherings!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cIntroducing someone to good Tex-Mex always makes me feel a little better,\u201d says New Yorker and Texas expat Liz Prentice. \u201cAlso, find a bar that has Shiner and frequent it! Shiner Cheer is especially comforting during the holiday season.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMake queso every chance you get,\u201d adds fellow New Yorker and Texas expat Emily Shelton. \u201cAnd invite friends over for breakfast tacos.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep home close to your heart<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of where home is, it holds a special meaning because your experience there helped shape who you are today.
