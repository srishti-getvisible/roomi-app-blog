Unfortunately, this closeness brings with it a higher risk of transmitted infection during the pandemic. One of the most significant disagreements that roommates have in their cramped apartments is how to correctly social distance. Whatever your relationship with those humans you live with, establishing these 5 key rules can help you reduce both physical contact &#8211; and heated conflict.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Discuss boundaries while living with roommates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Boundaries take on a new meaning and are critically important in a time like this. It may be that you and your roommate disagree on quiet hours and cleaning regimens during &#8220;normal&#8221; life, but a pandemic calls for some necessary changes. It&#8217;s healthy to maintain open communication with your roommates regarding social distancing and person-to-person interactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" data-attachment-id=\"10496\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/taking-coronavirus-precautions-with-roommates-roomi\/attachment\/pandemic-rules\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pandemic-rules.gif?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,281\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pandemic-rules\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pandemic-rules.gif?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pandemic-rules.gif?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/pandemic-rules.gif?resize=500%2C281&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"roommates establishing boundaries during a pandemic\" class=\"wp-image-10496\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the health hazard that coronavirus presents, you and your roommates must read from the same page regarding social distancing and sanitizing. You can openly talk to your roommate if you feel uncomfortable with the idea of them stepping out often and meeting people for leisure. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One common problem is having to deal with your roommate&#8217;s significant other spending more time in your apartment. Be honest and open about your apprehensions with your roommate. It&#8217;s a good idea to set a few healthy boundaries while living with roommates so that both of you feel secure in your home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Make a pact to stay home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being serious about staying home means no family visits, no vacations, and no balcony parties. You can consider putting it down in a roommate agreement for the benefit of all your housemates. If your roommates do not take this seriously, explain the consequences to them. The coronavirus pandemic doesn&#8217;t look at age, gender, or financial stability. It can happen to anyone &#8211; regardless of where they live and what their living situation is like. The least you can do for yourself and the people around you is practice social distancing and regularly sanitize your hands whenever you go out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related &#8211; <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/how-coronavirus-has-impacted-rent-prices-in-u-s-cities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How Coronavirus Has Impacted Rent Prices In U.S. Cities<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Come up with a contingency plan to stay safe <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Be prepared in advance! You should devise a contingency plan in case any of you gets affected by the coronavirus. Even if you&#8217;re practicing strict safety measures, it&#8217;s still possible to contract the virus, especially if one of you is an essential worker.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:57%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/TGXdPOgaor8CSrm42F\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/TGXdPOgaor8CSrm42F\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Think about what you&#8217;ll do&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/what-to-do-if-your-roommate-has-covid-symptoms-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">if someone falls ill<\/a>?

What about washroom visits? Will this person be allowed kitchen visits? Or will a roommate leave meals outside their bedroom door?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This conversation while living with roommates could be uncomfortable and scary, but it&#8217;s necessary. If you have a small apartment, your plan needs to be very creative, possibly with one roommate leaving the apartment altogether. The conversation should include finances; maintain an open dialogue with your landlord and consider requesting a payment extension if you&#8217;re facing financial issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.

You can immediately remove all your keys, phone, shoes, and clothes as you come back from the supermarket and prevent bacteria from tracking the entire apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5.

You may also need to establish quiet hours. Try to keep an open mind and remain flexible, as the pandemic situation is temporary and will soon subside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers with tips for living with roommates during a pandemic?
