While it\u2019s important that you and your roommates have personalities that blend well, it\u2019s also important to understand what you both expect from your shared living sitch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a conversation before the move-in date, to set rules around some key areas. This includes the time you should all wind down or lower the volume each night. If one roommate prefers an early night while the others want to watch horror films together, consider putting the early-nighter in the bedroom that\u2019s farthest away from the common areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also need to get on the same page in regards to chores and finances. Making a chores rota might seem too far (and doesn\u2019t fit in with the cool, laid-back image you\u2019re trying to project), but trust us \u2013 you\u2019ll be glad you did.&nbsp;Discuss how you plan to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/keep-track-expenses-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">split bills and track finances<\/a>.

With roommates, you can expect the unexpected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Embrace this. From quirky roommates to a TV that will only fire up when you slap it in a certain way, living with other people just gives your life a little extra character. First apartments aren\u2019t known for their high-glamour, and your beat-up bedroom with the odd decor and creaky floorboards might get on your nerves now. But we guarantee \u2013 you\u2019ll feel nostalgic in years to come when you\u2019re settled somewhere a little fancier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Shared living is about being considerate &amp; respectful!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/bad-neighbors-respect.gif?resize=500%2C264&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/bad-neighbors-respect.gif?resize=500%2C264&amp;ssl=1\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We know you want to show off your new-found pad (and therefore freedom) to your friends, but you have roommates to consider now. That means that if you want to throw parties or have groups of friends over (post-COVID, of course), you\u2019ll need to make sure everyone is cool with that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you really need is a little consideration. Would you want your roommate to bring their friends over while you\u2019re trying to study or just rejuvenate after a long day? Let them know in advance if you expect to have guests (this includes romantic interests!), keep noise to a minimum and avoid partying into the night. Even if you are celebrating your breakthrough into adulthood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Living with roommates<\/strong> = respecting each other&#8217;s personal space<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/best-friends-stepbrothers.gif?resize=480%2C204&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/best-friends-stepbrothers.gif?resize=480%2C204&amp;ssl=1\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t want to become that clingy roommate, right? You\u2019re probably super excited about your first &#8216;living with roommates&#8217; experience! But take some time to evaluate the kind of relationship your new roomis actually want. Before you force a friendship upon them! Some people are more introverted than others; they need their space, and engaging them in conversation more often than they\u2019d like can make them feel uncomfortable in their own home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because you\u2019re roommates, you don\u2019t have to be besties. If you\u2019re worried that you\u2019re not bonding as well as you\u2019d expected, don\u2019t let that worry you! Make the effort to get to know your roommate, but if a tight friendship isn\u2019t happening naturally, don\u2019t force it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers comfortably adjust to their first shared living experience?
