While in the packing phase, movers are always on the prowl for boxes from retail places who need to get rid of them. Go for a nice cardio boosting run or jog, and weave your path through retail heavy areas that aren\u2019t so far from home so if you are successful in finding boxes, you don\u2019t have to carry them for a too far.<\/span> There a fitness hack you thought you didn&#8217;t need but actually did. You&#8217;re welcome!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Make a fun playlist<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:53%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/5EJHDSPpFhbG0\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/5EJHDSPpFhbG0\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s podcasts or music, nearly everyone at the gym is listening to something as they work for those often elusive gains. Working out while packing should be no different. Make a cool Pandora station based on motivational songs like Survivor\u2019s \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d, or use any of these one hundred song playlists on Spotify found from&nbsp;Fitness Magazine. Your \u201cmoving mix\u201d will help keep the blood flowing and apply all the home exercise hacks we have for you here!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use proper workout form when packing<\/h3>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/140u4gNqQRIzkI\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/140u4gNqQRIzkI\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>No one ever got anywhere by skipping leg day, this is known around the world, but if you\u2019re trying to work out while moving, how can you make sure everything stays firm and tight? When packing the kitchen where you have empty cabinets of pots, pans, and canned goods, use a proper squatting technique. Do one item at a time, leaving the box on the floor, keeping your back straight. Now you&#8217;re applying one of the best fitness hacks out there and successfully doing squats while packing. <br><strong>Roomi&#8217;s Fitness Hack<\/strong>: Increase the weight with more items if you\u2019re looking to build or many lighter reps to just help you maintain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/creating-a-budget-friendly-gym-at-home-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How To Create a Budget-Friendly Gym At Home<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Home Exercise Hacks? Reimagine Chores!<\/h3>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/yuHTSjMXeWEKc\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/yuHTSjMXeWEKc\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Do reps every time you fill a box or bag! Topping off your moving box and taping it up means it\u2019s time for a HIIT (high-intensity interval training). Consider the weight of the box before you select your workout- safety first and make sure the items packed aren\u2019t fragile. Work your arms and shoulders with an upright row by lifting the box and winging out your elbows. Overhead tricep extensions can be done by lifting the box behind your head, arms at a 90-degree angle, elbows at your ears, and slowly lift the box straight up. <br><strong>Roomi&#8217;s Fitness Hack:<\/strong> Bags with handles make for an easy dumbbell curl. If you typical work muscle groups to failure, try not to, you\u2019re still on a mission to finish packing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these tricks, fitting a workout in while packing for your move is entirely possible. Look for opportunities every time you have to lift or bend and you\u2019ll be well on your way to staying fit while meeting your move out deadline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find home exercises and fitness hacks while packing?
