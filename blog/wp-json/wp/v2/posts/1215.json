As well as rightful towards the person you&#8217;ve been living with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Did you miss something important in your roommate agreement?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A roommate agreement is basically an understanding you share with your roommate, on paper or verbal. This agreement allows you to ensure that the people sharing a house together are able to respect each other&#8217;s space, time, and boundaries. If you have a roommate agreement, make sure your moving out doesn&#8217;t interfere with our roommate&#8217;s daily life. Just ensure you&#8217;re not doing so at a time when they have an important test or interview scheduled. Also, try your best to inform them about your move well before time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Check and re-check your lease and rental agreements.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both your <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/what-happens-roommate-breaks-lease\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lease and rental agreement, if broken<\/a>, can land you into real trouble. Most rental agreements last for one year, although this varies between properties. You\u2019ll need to know what kind of lease you signed up for. And, if you\u2019re leaving before the end of your agreed-upon tenancy, you\u2019ll need to find out what the process is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When checking your lease and\/or rental agreement, do not miss out on the following:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"has-normal-font-size wp-block-list\"><li>The end-of-lease date<\/li><li>Any clauses about breaking a lease early<\/li><li>The costs associated with transferring a name on a lease<\/li><li>The length of notice you need to give if you wish to vacate the property<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If you&#8217;re not sure about moving out, don&#8217;t.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"8347\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-tell-roommates-moving-out\/attachment\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"woman in a grey sweater is holding a packing box as she figures the process of her moving out\" class=\"wp-image-8347\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1320&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-unsure-about-moving-out-holding-a-packing-box-scaled.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before telling your roommates that you\u2019re ready to go, it\u2019s time to have some internal conversations to make sure it\u2019s really what you want to do.

There can be costs involved with name transfers, hiring moving companies, and you can often expect some cleaning costs to be deducted from your deposit (unless you guys have been super careful.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve made up your mind and you just can\u2019t wait to move in with your partner and a cockapoo puppy, then you\u2019re ready for the conversation.

It makes the whole process a little lighter on everyone and affords enough time for you to find a replacement. If you have a roommate agreement, you must honour it for the sake of the time you spent living with your roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try giving at least four weeks notice, and then you can work together to get the room filled and lessen the financial strain on everyone involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Moving out with an \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Telling your roommates you\u2019re leaving is similar to a break-up &#8211; <em>really. <\/em>It\u2019s a tough conversation and it\u2019s natural to feel anxious beforehand. You already know what you\u2019re going to say, so stick to the script.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell them exactly why you\u2019re leaving, and leave anything negative out of it. Explain that you\u2019ve made great memories in this apartment but it\u2019s time for you to move on because of x reason. Whatever you do, keep the conversation light-hearted, because you don\u2019t want your next four weeks to be awkward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have the conversation in your home where you both feel comfortable, and keep it as short and painless as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Help ease the strain by finding them a roommate replacement!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your lease agreement may or may not require that you find a roommate replacement should you wish to move out. But either way, we recommend helping your soon-to-be-ex-roommates fill your room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can try posting advertisements on Facebook groups or you can use a <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">roommate finding tool <\/a>like Roomi, which uses a verified community of people looking for homes or housemates.
