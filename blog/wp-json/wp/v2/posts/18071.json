The thing is, you&#8217;re also acutely aware that rental costs could burn a hole in your pocket. Which is why you&#8217;re searching for the best room finder to find the perfect room for your budget and needs. Roomi and Nooklyn, for instance, help you find rooms for rent, as well as offer other services and features. While you can always try both of these, we figured we&#8217;d compare them to save you the hassle. Here&#8217;s a Roomi review <em>and<\/em> a Nooklyn review so you can get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pricing-are-these-room-finder-apps-free-or-paid\">Pricing: Are these room finder apps free or paid?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like any app, pricing is important, especially if you&#8217;ll use it for a while to find rooms for rent. Which is why we&#8217;ve taken a look at how much it costs to use Roomi and Nooklyn. Here&#8217;s how much their plans cost, and what you get out of them. We\u2019re sure that after reading this article, you&#8217;ll be able to decide which is the best room finder in terms of value and features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is Nooklyn legit? With Nooklyn, you can sign up and search rental spaces for free on the platform. Under a free account, you can request a tour, contact landlords, and message real estate agents. Should you wish to submit an application, you&#8217;ll need to first pay a fee of $9.29. This is on top of the deposit that most landlords require before even considering an application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Roomi, you can also search for rooms and roommates for free. As a free user, you can send five messages or swipes per day, plus activate up to two listings. Note that to list a property on Nooklyn, you&#8217;ll need to pay $5 per listing. This is just one example of how much more you get out of Roomi as a Nooklyn alternative.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:51%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/snxEUPK0pMsDe\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/snxEUPK0pMsDe\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>When you sign up for the Roomi Gold subscription, you&#8217;ll get even more value for your money. First, you need to choose between a personal or a business plan. Personal users get unlimited messaging, identity verification, and a ranking boost for seven times more views on listings. Depending on the business tier you choose, you can get a verified partner badge, unlimited listings, and unlimited messaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay either $29.99 for one month or $14.99 for an entire year. With Nooklyn, advertisers need to fork out $300 per month when billed annually or $350 month-to-month. Otherwise, you can pay $5 for a single post that lasts for 60 days, though this price plan has limited features. From the numbers alone, it&#8217;s clear which room finder app is worth every buck and a great Nooklyn alternative. (*<em>cough&#8230;<\/em> it&#8217;s Roomi).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust\">Security: Can these apps help me find roommates I can trust?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No one wants to end up with a roommate they don&#8217;t feel safe or comfortable around. Imagine moving to an unfamiliar city as an international student, without having a single friend or relative in the area. A scary scenario is if your roommate shows up and doesn\u2019t match their online profile. This is why it&#8217;s important that the room finder you&#8217;re eyeing connects you with people that have been pre-screened.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/IgdvQ2Gy8oiPA2arIj\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/IgdvQ2Gy8oiPA2arIj\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"verification-of-roommate-contact-info\">Verification of Roommate Contact Info<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When room finders can verify roommates&#8217; contact info, they&#8217;re able to establish that actual people are signed up in the app. Which is the best room finder when it comes to contact info verification?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s do a Nooklyn review of its roommate info verification process. As a Nooklyn user, you&#8217;re required to use an e-mail address. But note that providing your phone number is optional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Nooklyn alternative, Roomi verifies both a user&#8217;s phone number and e-mail address, using GlobaliD, a digital identity platform. Users are required to create a GlobaliD and connect it with Roomi. Through this system, GlobaliD verifications describe something about users that a third-party agency has verified to be true. It&#8217;s a far cry from Nooklyn&#8217;s required sign-up info. This major investment speaks volumes about how much Roomi values the legitimacy of information shared by users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"id-verification\">ID Verification<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is the best room finder when it comes to ID verification?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might ask yourself: is Nooklyn legit? Users who create an account on Nooklyn need to undergo ID verification. Basically, you need to submit a selfie, as well as photos of the front and back of a state ID or passport. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/resimpli.com\/best-real-estate-agents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Best real estate agents<\/a><\/strong>, meanwhile, have to submit their real estate license. They then go through a face-matching process, wherein they ensure your photo matches that on the ID. Once verified, you can start searching and connecting with potential roommates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Roomi, roommates need to go through a background check. Aside from the standard ID verification, users also need to add their social media account as an additional security measure. Once verified, you&#8217;ll see their profiles marked with a &#8220;premium&#8221; badge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose who can message you by approving or declining chat requests. You can filter roommates by neighborhood, age, gender, and when they were last active. All these additional features ensure you&#8217;re able to find a suitable roommate you can trust and feel safe around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"privacy-and-security-of-profiles\">Privacy and Security of Profiles<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Is Nooklyn legit? As you use Nooklyn, it collects information about you and your online activities. It taps into your location, the pages you view, your searches, and even your messages. You can also configure two-factor authentication via SMS or an authenticator app for added security. Only other users signed into the app will be able to view your profile and they won&#8217;t see your address.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, Roomi uses industry-leading security practices and the GlobaliD verification system. Yes, it similarly collects your personal information and usage data, but does this through GlobaliD&#8217;s state-of-the-art public-key cryptography framework. Your private data is safely stored in the GlobaliD vault, which cannot be accessed or shared without your explicit consent. This means that your data isn\u2019t stored on each new service provider you choose to connect to your GlobaliD.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only fully verified users who have undergone the background check will be displayed on the platform. No, your address won&#8217;t be displayed. Potential roommates can check out your bio, as well as your roommate and moving preferences. You&#8217;ll be able to see from the get-go if they smoke, have pets, and what their budget is. All super handy information so you can find the best roommate &#8211; faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the unlikely event that Roomi gets hacked, know that your data is secure as it is not kept on Roomi servers. On top of the GDPR, Roomi users can enjoy secure in-app messaging to contact potential roommates without sharing personal info. Unlike Nooklyn, Roomi does not collect data about you by looking into your chats with fellow users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"24-7-support-content-moderation\">24\/7 Support &amp; Content Moderation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During these times when everybody&#8217;s constantly online (and in a rush), there&#8217;s nothing as satisfying as receiving a speedy response. If you ever encounter a problem while transacting on a room finder, you&#8217;ll need someone who can immediately assist you. You never know who&#8217;s out there lurking online, so it helps to know someone is keeping a close eye on content, so there&#8217;s nothing weird going on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Nooklyn, you can check out their FAQs (frequently asked questions) page or send them an e-mail. Note that their FAQs page doesn&#8217;t share a lot of the information you may need, but you also have the option to speak to a customer service representative for any complaints.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Roomi, you get more than the standard customer support. Apart from this, an in-house content moderation team is working away to filter out any spammy content or bad listings. This gives users peace of mind that they&#8217;re dealing with legit and verified listings in a spam-free environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"criminal-background-check\">Criminal Background Check<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You never know if there are bad people out there waiting for the perfect opportunity to prey on unsuspecting roommates. Sure, IDs can be verified, but anyone can have a perfectly decent front and hide a criminal history. A criminal background check takes your safety to a higher level so you&#8217;re sure your roommate&#8217;s not an axe murderer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi&#8217;s background check scans for criminal records under offense categories of fraud, sex, substance abuse, theft, and violence, among others. Nooklyn, on the other hand, pales in comparison. Apart from its ID verification process, Nooklyn does not have an explicit criminal background check for its users and applicants. We&#8217;re sure you\u2019ve already figured out which is the best room finder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"user-profiles-which-app-makes-it-easier-to-find-your-perfect-roommate\">User Profiles: Which App Makes It Easier To Find Your Perfect Roommate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Nooklyn and Roomi deliver in terms of providing you a list of potential roommates. With Nooklyn, you can like user profiles that display compatible move-in dates and rental budget, and message them straight away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Roomi, you have additional info so you can cherry pick roommates you feel you would best get along with. Plus, the interface is clean-looking and easy to navigate. Hands down, Roomi makes it easier and more convenient for you to find the perfect roommate since you have more info at your disposal to make a selection.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:83%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/RiVbSiRiECwM8zFUMi\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/RiVbSiRiECwM8zFUMi\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you\">So, which is the best room finder for you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope this article, with its Nooklyn review and Roomi review, guides you as you transfer to a new place. Moving never gets easier, no matter how many times you&#8217;ve done it. Thankfully, technology makes it more convenient for people to find a place to stay as well as search out potential roommates. Having a reliable app that does all these makes all the difference. When it prioritizes safety, data privacy, convenience, and pricing, moving becomes a secure experience and less of a hassle. Roomi, hands down, is the best room finder for you.
