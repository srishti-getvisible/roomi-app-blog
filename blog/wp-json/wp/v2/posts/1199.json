What can you do if\/when this happens?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could consider taking them to a small claims court to recover what they owe. You won\u2019t need a lawyer and the process is relatively quick and simple; you\u2019ll just need to take the lease and explain what happened.

The thought of having to cover more rent and bills can be overwhelming, but remember that you have rights and it\u2019s in your best interests to fulfill your rental agreement.<br>If you do want to move out, follow the proper procedure. Give your landlord plenty of notice and be prepared to pay any remaining rent or bills that you owe. Some landlords might not allow you to break out of the entire lease early &#8211; but others are more accommodating, and simple honesty could go a long way.
