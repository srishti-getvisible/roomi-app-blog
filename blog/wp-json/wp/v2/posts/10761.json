But trust us, you\u2019re going to need it. Because as much as you adore your pet, sometimes giving them full access to your house can cause trouble.

Here is a Foolproof Guide!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Make use of the mudroom<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few apartments have features that are pet friendly by default but a mudroom is one of them. If you happen to live in an apartment in Los Angeles that has a mudroom, then your home is already pet friendly! You just need to make some modifications! Set up a little clean-up station in your mudroom and call it a day. But if you happen to live in a small apartment that doesn\u2019t have a mudroom, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got decor solutions for you too! Just make some space near your door that will act as a clean up station. But remember any furniture you put around there should be stain-resistant! Another great apartment hack is to tile the area so that it\u2019s easier to clean up the splatters! Here\u2019s a gorgeous example of a DIY mudroom!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/140806228626747\/\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-pinterest\">https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/140806228626747\/<\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Furniture, fabric and fashion!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as you might already know, having pets can be quite stressful for your belongings\u2026 Of course you\u2019ll train your pets and they\u2019ll learn how to behave in-doors, but accidents will happen.
