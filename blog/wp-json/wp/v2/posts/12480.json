It is one of the most affordable cities in the country. It has a booming job market. It has an extremely diverse population. It is one of the top three food cities in the country. It is also home to the biggest medical center in the world. We could go on and on, but the list is never ending. So, if you\u2019re stuck wondering whether or not to make the move, don\u2019t. Instead ask yourself, when you should move. Because there are very few cities that are as great as Houston. And, when you do decide to move, we\u2019re going to be here to help you find great rooms for rent in Houston, Texas. But before we get to that, let\u2019s learn a little more about the city!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting to Know Houston<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Houston is home to NASA\u2019s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center due to which it\u2019s officially known as the Space City. But that\u2019s not all, over time the city has accumulated many nicknames, including the Bayou City, Magnolia City, Hustle Town and The Big Heart. If that doesn\u2019t tell you how awesome and versatile this place is, we don\u2019t know what will. One of the most diverse cities in the country, more than a whopping 145 languages are spoken here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But beware of the weather here, it tends to be hot and humid. In fact, you probably won\u2019t need a winter wardrobe at all.The temperature barely ever drops below the 60s, even in peak winters. All you need is a cute coat and you\u2019re prepared to face the winters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite the humidity, Houston is a great city to live in. The housing market is one of the most affordable in Texas, so finding cheap rooms for rent in Houston is easy. It is also the largest city in Texas and attracts tens of thousands of new residents every year. With a booming job market, some of the best food in the country and a relatively low cost of living, Houston is a great option for all. But carry a lot of insect repellent.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:41%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3oEjHWzZQaCrZW2aWs\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3oEjHWzZQaCrZW2aWs\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rooms-for-rent-in-atlanta\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Find Rooms for Rent in Atlanta<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding Rooms for Rent in Houston<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people who move to Houston move here because it is super affordable.

It consistently ranks as one of the best neighborhoods to live in, not just in Houston but in the rest of the country as well. While generally considered an expensive area, finding reasonably priced rooms for rent in this part of Houston, Texas shouldn\u2019t be too hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Montrose<\/strong>: This is the artistic and cultural soul of Houston. Filled with amazing bohemian cafes, theatres and art galleries, Montrose has also been a historically LGBT-friendly neighborhood. The rental market here is also super affordable, so finding good rooms for rent here is easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>River Oaks<\/strong>: No list about Houston neighborhoods is complete without mentioning River Oaks. Filled with historic mansions, just being in River Oaks will make you feel like royalty. While most people can\u2019t afford to live here (the average home value here is over $2 million), it\u2019s one of the most culturally and historically significant neighborhoods of Houston. Both the iconic River Oaks District and the River Oaks Theatre are here. We strongly recommend exploring this neighborhood at least once, even if you can\u2019t afford to look at rooms for rent in this part of Houston.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Average Rent in Houston<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-stripes\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rooms for Rent in Houston<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Average Rent <\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/32DaV9F\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Studio Apartment in Houston <\/a><\/td><td>$927<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3aOD9Tx\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">1 Bedroom Apartment in Houston<\/a><\/td><td>$798<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/3n9RRtb\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">2 Bedroom Apartment in Houston<\/a><\/td><td>$1,610<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3sMgDQZ\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">3 Bedroom Apartment in Houston <\/a><\/td><td>$2,199<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">University Life in Houston<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Houston ranks consistently among the most affordable cities for students to live in. The average cost of living for students is between $1000-$2000 a month. That\u2019s cheaper than most cities in the country. Especially because you can find many affordable rooms for rent in Houston, Texas. Moreover, the city of Houston offers up many fun things for students to do. Whether that\u2019s visiting the Space Center, eating at one of the hundred amazing restaurants, strolling through the Houston Zoo or catching a game at the Minute Maid Park, there\u2019s a whole lot to do in Houston. So, if you\u2019re wondering where you should go for college, Houston has some great options for you.

In fact, you\u2019ll need a car for most things. However, neighborhoods such as Montrose and Downtown are quite walkable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Roads\/Traffic in Houston:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to live in Houston, you better get familiar with the term \u201cthe loop\u201d. If you ask anyone for directions here, they\u2019re going to use the Loop as reference. The Loop is the Interstate 610 that loops around central Houston and everything falls either inside or outside the loop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Taxis in Houston<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of taxis in Houston, so hailing one from a taxi stand won\u2019t be a problem. Remember, the City of Houston has authorized a flat taxi fare of $6 for all trips in the downtown area making it a very affordable mode of travel. You can also get an Uber or Lyft if you\u2019re more comfortable with that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.

The Metro Light Rail connects Downtown to Reliant Stadium and costs $1.25 both ways. The local bus is also available on most streets with a one-way fare of $1.25.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Airports in Houston<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Houston has two 4-star airports, George Bush Intercontinental (IAH) and Houston Hobby Airport (HOU). It also has a civil\/military airport called Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6.

You can rent a bike for $3 per 30-minutes from any kiosk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Healthcare in Houston<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People from around the world come to Houston to receive the best treatment for their ailment. Houston is home to the largest largest medical centre- <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tmc.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Texas Medical Center<\/a>. The center is spread over 1,000 acres of land and is visited by over 7.2 million patients every year.

In fact, GQ once called Houston \u201cAmerica\u2019s next best food city\u201d. Yeah, it\u2019s <em>that<\/em> good. So, of course, we can\u2019t end this blog without mentioning the food here. Of course, writing down all the good restaurants in the city would be an impossible task. There\u2019s just too many. Some of which you\u2019ll find on your own while exploring the city. But here\u2019s a list of some of the best restaurants that you should make a point of checking out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.killensbarbecue.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Killen&#8217;s Barbecue<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/stateofgracetx.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">State of Grace<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uchihouston.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uchi<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.houstoniamag.com\/restaurants\/lee-s-fried-chicken-and-donuts\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lee&#8217;s Fried Chicken &amp; Donuts<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.haymerchant.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Hay Merchant<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.madhouston.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MAD<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Other blogs you might find interesting! <\/p>\n\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Moving to Houston is a great idea for many reasons.
