Asking lots of questions up front can be time-consuming, yes. And doing something like a background check can be a little intimidating at first, true. But think about it. You are about to open the door wide open, hand over a set of keys, provide easy access to all your stuff, and place your financial well-being in the hands of a complete and total stranger.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah, sounds like a good time to be thorough.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Do a background check<\/b> if you want to find a good roommate in NYC<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.realtor.com\/advice\/rent\/run-background-check-roommate\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">background check<\/a> on a roommate is street smart.

Having a great roommate can go south fast if you discover later that they have bad credit and you can\u2019t renew. Next thing you know, you\u2019re moving into a lousy room in a bad part of town with your super sweet, mired in credit debt roommate.
