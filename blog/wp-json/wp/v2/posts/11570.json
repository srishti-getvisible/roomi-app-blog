A bathroom becomes the storage spot for so many things that a small bathroom can quickly become your most hated spot in the house. It&#8217;s easy to end up with a space that is cluttered, and dysfunctional. And this is definitely not the best way to start your day. So what do you do when you&#8217;re stuck looking at your reflection among a pile of things that you don&#8217;t need, and an unseen pile of things that you need but can&#8217;t find? Here are our best bathroom hacks, for organizing storage, especially in a small bathroom!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/roomis-guide-to-studio-apartments-and-small-spaces-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roomi\u2019s Guide To Working With Small Spaces &amp; Studio Apartments<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bathroom hacks can only benefit you after a good decluttering.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve taken everything out, to give yourself a fresh canvas to work with, we suggest the following things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Clean the area completely.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The area that remains, once you&#8217;ve taken out everything that you can take out from your bathroom, move on to the cleaning! Make sure to wash the shower curtain, get under the shelves, and scrub your tub floors!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make sure every item has a designated spot.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to bringing order to a disorganized bathroom (after decluttering!) is making sure that every single item has a designated spot. This is especially challenging, again, due to the lack of space, which affects everything from where to put your toothbrush and toothpaste to how to store the extra towels and toilet paper rolls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you let your creativity run wild, without caring for &#8220;how things should be&#8221;, the results can be quite exciting!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Small bathroom hacks we absolutely swear by!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/dan-blaushild-dQlhi4G8bDSz7uhtGN\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media3.giphy.com\/media\/dQlhi4G8bDSz7uhtGN\/giphy.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Surf Duck GIF by Dan Blaushild - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/9-space-saving-hacks-for-a-small-kitchen-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">9 Space Saving Kitchen Hacks For Your NYC Apartment<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Assigning drawers to the different members of the house using the bathroom.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If more than one family member uses the same bathroom, keep their supplies in designated drawers.

But then there\u2019s visual clutter, the \u201cnoise\u201d of colorful labels and different-sized containers. To infuse your shower with the spa feeling you crave, dry decanting into eye-pleasing, uniform containers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The walls beside the vanity are the perfect place for a shelf, if your counter space is lacking.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/secure.notion-static.com\/a55e3e2a-a113-4147-a6c2-30b676e10aee\/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a vanity with a tray of towels on the floor\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A shelf next to the vanity will undoubtedly keep things off the counters. But that&#8217;s not all. This will allow your entire bathroom a more picked-up look but still leave the items you use daily within easy reach. And it\u2019s deeper than the shelves of built-in medicine cabinets, so you can stop wishing you had one!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Incorporate a tray to unify small essentials.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/secure.notion-static.com\/6d94577f-2141-4071-84e2-9bfb40dd886d\/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a tray of bathroom essentials to store small items neatly over the tub\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another organizing classic from our archive of bathroom hacks, this one is literally just putting small objects on trays to make your left-out essentials look purposefully placed.

Under-sink organizers are specifically made to make the most of the space beneath your sink. By going vertical, this expandable under-sink organizer allows you to stack cleaning supplies or bulkier bathroom items, no digging or shuffling things around necessary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hang a shower organizer from the same hooks as your shower curtain.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can hang more than just the shower curtain from the shower curtain rod.
