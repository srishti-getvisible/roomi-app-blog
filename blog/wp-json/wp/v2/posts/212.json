Physical and <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/mindful-habits-for-your-mental-health-during-covid-19\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mental health<\/a> play a huge role in the everyday lives of roommates. And when one party is struggling with something, the other needs to know how and when to help.&nbsp;November is National Epilepsy Awareness Month. And we&#8217;re going to talk about epileptic seizures and how to deal if a roommate is having a seizure. So if you live with a roommate who is epileptic, find out what you should or shouldn\u2019t be doing to help your roommate live better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Epilepsy Common?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>About 65 million people around the world have epilepsy. And over 2 million in the United States alone, according to the Epilepsy Foundation. One in 26 people in the U.S. will develop epilepsy at some point in their lifetime. However, the condition is still widely misunderstood. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sjpreston2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">Sarah Preston<\/a>, 22, a senior studying strategic communication and public policy at American University, was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2008. Though Preston&nbsp;considers herself fortunate, as she has a controlled form of epilepsy. And she only has an epileptic seizure about once every six months to a year. But she says people\u2019s lack of knowledge can make it difficult to talk about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know a lot about the condition,\u201d Preston says. \u201cA lot of people hear the word epilepsy and they kind of freak out.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Definition of Epilepsy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By definition, epilepsy is a neurological condition that affects the nervous system. And in that, abnormal electrical discharge in the brain causes seizures. The seizures can range from mild to convulsive, explains Dr. Ruben Kuzniecky, Co-Director of the NYU Epilepsy Center and neurology professor at NYU. Kuzniecky says there\u2019s still stigma attached to epilepsy due to societal misconceptions. And one of the most basic things people should know: There is no \u201cone\u201d epilepsy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cEpilepsy is not one disease. It\u2019s really an expression of underlying, different conditions,\u201d Kuzniecky says. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason you have epilepsies that are benign. And epilepsies that are malignant to the point that they cause a tremendous amount of havoc to patients.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Preston has always made it a habit to tell her roommates about her condition. Her advice: Be aware if your roommate is epileptic, what kind of epileptic seizures he or she suffers from. What to do if your roommate is having a seizure. And make sure to ask questions about how you can help your roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cMake sure to explain to them what the condition is, what it means, and how they should respond [if you have a seizure],\u201d Preston advises. \u201cWhen in doubt, call the hospital, but listen to what your roommate says.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There are different types of Epilepsy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like there\u2019s no singular epilepsy, there are many types of epileptic seizures. And they can vary in severity and manifest differently. Some seizures may go under the radar if you don\u2019t know what to expect. And if you don&#8217;t recognize the signs of a roommate having a seizure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cOne [type of seizure] is where you only have a click in your hand or a little jerk, and you don\u2019t lose awareness,\u201d Kuzniecky says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe second type is where you lose consciousness or awareness; you\u2019re confused, you have no memory of the event, and you don\u2019t know what happens to you during the event. And the third one is a convulsive seizure. All your limbs get stiff, and you fall and jerk; and you\u2019re out for a longer period of time.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuzniecky says you can help your epileptic roommate by making sure they remain uninjured during the epileptic seizure. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Here&#8217;s what you should do if your roommate is having a seizure<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Lay them on their side on a floor or bed, so saliva can leave the mouth if necessary.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don\u2019t put anything in their mouth, and be sure they are breathing normally after the seizure.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>During non-convulsive&nbsp;seizures, make sure the person doesn\u2019t do anything dangerous. Both during the episode or in the moments of confusion afterward. Remove any objects from their hands, and gently try to encourage them to sit down until the seizure is over.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuzniecky says it may be necessary to call 911 depending on the kind of epileptic seizures. But again, check with your roommate about what\u2019s normal to avoid overreacting. Preston, for example, advised her roommates not to call 911 unless her a seizure lasted longer than 60-90 seconds, as hers typically lasted about 30 seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cMore often than not, I\u2019ve had a seizure around a roommate or two, and they do get nervous and call 911 anyway, which is fine and understandable,\u201d Preston says. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know how to react when they see someone have a seizure, and it can get scary.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUsually after I\u2019ve had an episode, I don\u2019t really get asked about it by my roommates anymore and things return to normal, which is really great and I really appreciate it.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Encourage your epileptic roommate to be healthy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuzniecky says you can help your roommate by simply encouraging a healthy routine. It\u2019s extremely important for those with epileptic seizures and disorders to take their medication on time. Also, to avoid behaviors that can trigger seizures such as drinking, using drugs or not sleeping regularly. Another way you can be helpful is to make sure your home is safe for them. Do not leave out sharp objects or things that they can trip over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on how often the epileptic seizures occur and your roommate\u2019s personality, however, he or she may need very little looking after. For someone like Preston, who has lived with epilepsy for some time and whose condition is also largely under control, her roommates aren\u2019t very involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty independent and self-sufficient. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever told them my regular prevention measures. And they don\u2019t specifically know the medication I\u2019m taking,\u201d Preston says. \u201cI try to keep them as calm as possible about it. So I don\u2019t ask for them to help, and usually they forget about it or don\u2019t address it again.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be understanding and compassionate towards your epileptic roommate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For some, living with a roommate who is epileptic may be as normal as living with someone who doesn\u2019t. But for those with epilepsy, the condition can have unseen consequences. Preston struggled in her early college days to speak openly about her condition. But today, she says she understands how being honest helped her set the tone for how she wanted others to react.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cBecause I have such a controlled and mild form of epilepsy, it rarely comes across that I am epileptic,\u201d Preston says. \u201cUsually I\u2019ll tell my roommate on the first day, and it\u2019ll just stay in the background because the kind of epilepsy I have isn\u2019t recognizable on the outset, so the relationships haven\u2019t really been affected at all, which is great.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The most you can do as a roommate is be&nbsp;respectful and mindful of what your roommate is going through. Even if you can\u2019t readily see it. Acknowledge that epilepsy is something to be taken seriously, Kuzniecky advises, and that you can play a large role to help your roommate live with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cBe sensitive to the fact that they have a medical condition like any other, and that you can be kind, help them live with this condition and making their life a little bit better.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers co live with an epileptic roommate<\/strong>?<strong> With our ever-increasing lists of rooms and roommates across the world, we help you find your perfect match! <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download the app here and hop on the easiest ride home, ever<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Co-living means sharing a lot of your life with the person or people in your home.
