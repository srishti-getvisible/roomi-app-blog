Now what? Time to find fun traditions to explore with your roommate! When you find a Roomi as awesome as you, you need to make sure they stick around. First, make sure that you are a good roommate to them. Then, break the ice by spending time with roommates with these easy and fun roomi traditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Spa Day: Skincare tradition to explore with your roommate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Going out to get a facial and massage can cost you close to a hundred bucks. Now that all of us live under an umbrella of coronavirus, it&#8217;s best to avoid going out anyway. Having a spa day at home won&#8217;t cost you more than a few dollars, max. Plus, you&#8217;ll be inside the comfort of your house and be free to enjoy a glass of wine while you&#8217;re at it! So take out your fluffy robe and comfy slippers and explore with your roommate, all the new skincare fads!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/heyarnold-nickelodeon-hey-arnold-xT1Ra0MKzjbQhpz4NW\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media1.giphy.com\/media\/xT1Ra0MKzjbQhpz4NW\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Hey Arnold Nickelodeon GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan one day out of the month to be your spa day. If a monthly routine seems like a big commitment, just pull out the &#8220;us-time&#8221; when you feel like you need to relax and rejuvenate. You can plan to do each other&#8217;s nails and face mask, but nothing beats a good foot massage! Once you rub your roommate&#8217;s feet, you&#8217;re practically best friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2XFrKdP5Gq\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/takeaways-from-an-iconic-coliving-relationship-roomi\/\">5 Things Monica And Rachel Taught Us about Coliving<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;5 Things Monica And Rachel Taught Us about Coliving&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog\" src=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/takeaways-from-an-iconic-coliving-relationship-roomi\/embed\/#?secret=2XFrKdP5Gq\" data-secret=\"2XFrKdP5Gq\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Venting Time: Explore your deepest feelings with your roommate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be real. One thing people love more than complaining about their life is talking about how busy they are and how being busy is adding stress to their lives. But why does it feel sooooo good to vent about your stress and life issues?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/cbs-h50-hawaiifive0-3o6gEcsu2lapoSO3N6\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/3o6gEcsu2lapoSO3N6\/giphy.gif?resize=400%2C225&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Roommates Roomies GIF by CBS - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Eva Stubits, Ph.D., a Houston-based clinical psychologist specializing in stress management, says that talking about your personal stress can help you get it out of your system. Basically, talking about the feelings that are bothering you enables you to process them faster. You and your roommate can have a day or two during the week to open the lid and let off some steam. It&#8217;ll be a great way to mutually <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/the-benefits-of-living-with-roommates-vs-living-alone\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">support each other<\/a> and catch up on the craziness of your lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0953WbeaOK\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/spotting-telltale-signs-of-anxiety-in-your-roommate-roomi\/\">Is Your Roommate Doing Ok?

Furniture Shopping = Retail therapy + company of a good roommate <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the dawn of the &#8220;work from home&#8217; culture, it&#8217;s going to be up to you to make your space more inspiring and Insta-worthy. Since you and your roommate could be looking at spending most of your hours at home, this is a good activity for you both. You can make it a regular tradition to explore with your roommate for thrifty furniture and home decor items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/dog-friends-joey-xUOxf9EI2iTP9tl9Yc\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/xUOxf9EI2iTP9tl9Yc\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C320&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dog Friends GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Weekly Clean-up: Productivity + opportunity for spending time with roommates!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleaning up after yourself is a good roommate etiquette that you should practice every day. Decluttering, washing your dishes, and watering your plants (if you have any) is something you should engage in daily. A weekly cleaning session with your roommate where you can sweep, mop, and vacuum can be a fun exercise. Instead of dreading the effort required from your end to complete these chores, you&#8217;re more likely to hang out and chill if you&#8217;re sharing tasks with your roommate and doing them together. So blast that cheesy Spotify playlist, and get scrubbing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/broadcity-season-5-episode-4-broad-city-2tSk579HlpT7n8VOY9\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.giphy.com\/media\/2tSk579HlpT7n8VOY9\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Clean Out Season 5 GIF by Broad City - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"RYnrfsZesC\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/the-benefits-of-living-with-roommates-vs-living-alone\/\">The Benefits of Living With Roommates Vs.

Movie Night: spending quality time with roommates made easy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that this tradition is loved worldwide. Just the thought of coming home to a glass of margarita and a dose of laughter from your favorite standup comedian on Netflix, while you chill on the couch with chips down your shirt.
