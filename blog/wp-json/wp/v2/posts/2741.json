With responsibilities piling up on the work front, the boundaries between WFH and personal leisure time are also blurring. Many coworkers view talking about their problems as a sign of weakness or vulnerability. However, if you&#8217;re noticing signs of burnout or emotional fatigue &#8211; reach out to your coworkers with empathy, even when you can&#8217;t physically be with them. Kindness at work is what the world needs today!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-rounded\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-attachment-id=\"10401\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/4-ways-to-be-kind-to-coworkers-amid-the-pandemic-roomi\/attachment\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"kindness at work while employees work from home 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"An illustration about kindness and how contagious it is\" class=\"wp-image-10401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1485&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/kindness-at-work-while-employees-work-from-home-1-scaled.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At Roomi, we aim to celebrate kindness every day!

The coronavirus pandemic has impacted our physical, mental, and social wellbeing. With our minds filled with anxieties and a sense of impending doom, it&#8217;s hard to find calm &amp; peace in our waking lives. However, our actions can help establish a positive work field for many of our coworkers who WFH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It&#8217;s okay to not be perfect<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it okay for coworkers to not have perfect outfits, hair, or backgrounds during Zoom calls. It&#8217;s always great to practice what you preach; in this case, you could start by sharing instances that point out how you&#8217;re struggling and need help. This will encourage more people to speak up and deal with the crisis in a better way. Just be sure it doesn&#8217;t spiral into a negative conversation, and offer supportive ways to help them through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A culture of gratitude<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider initiating a team gratitude practice by starting or finishing each meeting with a question:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>What made you smile today?<\/li><li>What are you most grateful for today?<\/li><li>What&#8217;s the Coronavirus pandemic taught you?<\/li><li>What&#8217;s one thing you took for granted before the Coronavirus pandemic?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Be patient &amp; forgiving<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Get in the habit of appreciating more and criticizing less. Be patient and understanding with your coworkers, yes, even when they arrive late at a meeting or forget some detail in an email\/presentation. For example: &#8220;Jennifer, I noticed that you haven&#8217;t submitted the weekly report yet. I wanted to check if you need my help with it. Also hoping you and your family are doing well.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of a crisis, how we respond when coworkers make a mistake profoundly impacts them and the culture you&#8217;re trying to build.
