Although many of us attribute success to money and fame, the path to success is unique for all. We can blame this notion on how we get to know the story of successful people in the first place. As a straight-A student with a shiny university degree, you may well be successful, but that&#8217;s not always a guarantee. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, all we need is <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/6-expert-tips-on-making-a-career-change-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a fresh take on success<\/a>. Most stories of successful people have trained us to believe that without &#8220;proper&#8221; education, our chances of success are slim. Yet we see many examples of successful people who weren&#8217;t bright students &#8211; and many who didn&#8217;t even finish school!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/249961\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Walt Disney, Elton John, James Cameron, Frank Lloyd Wright, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs all have one thing in common.<\/a> Apart from being famous and successful people, they&#8217;re all school\/college dropouts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some inspiring stories of famous people who were not so successful in school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1.

She became famous with 1994&#8217;s &#8216;The Mask.&#8217; She roughly made $200 million with a low budget film. And retained her Forbes&#8217; Top-Earning Actress title 20 years later, and the &#8216;successful people&#8217; title in our collective consciousness. Did you know that Diaz had a challenging school experience and dropped out at 16 to pursue a modeling career?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>So as the story of successful people goes: if you have a dream, by all means, pursue that dream!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" data-attachment-id=\"8318\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/stories-of-famous-people-who-failed-in-school-roomi\/attachment\/cameron-diaz-successful-people\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Cameron-Diaz-successful-people.jpg?fit=1200%2C630&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,630\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Cameron-Diaz-successful-people\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Cameron-Diaz-successful-people.jpg?fit=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Cameron-Diaz-successful-people.jpg?fit=1024%2C538&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Cameron-Diaz-successful-people.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Cameron Diaz, Actress\" class=\"wp-image-8318\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Cameron-Diaz-successful-people.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Cameron-Diaz-successful-people.jpg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Cameron-Diaz-successful-people.jpg?resize=768%2C403&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Cameron-Diaz-successful-people.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Source: The Vulture<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.
