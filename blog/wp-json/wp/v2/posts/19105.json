If your landlord is trying to charge more than the market rate, then you\u2019ll need to negotiate. You don\u2019t want to pay more for a rental that other tenants enjoy at a lower price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of your research should include talking to other tenants around the area. Find out how much they pay for a similar apartment and compare. If they pay less, you can negotiate a rent increase with your landlord, especially during lease renewal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-state-your-case-properly\">2. <strong>State your case properly<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your landlord know why you want to negotiate. Be as authentic as possible, and lay out the facts about your situation. Let them know how an increased rent would negatively impact you or your roommate(s). When you\u2019ve done your research and understand more about the apartment\u2019s rental value, it becomes easier to state your case. Preparation is key!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-bargain-for-upgrades\">3. <strong>Bargain for upgrades<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re facing a rent increase that you can\u2019t get out of, you can ask for an upgrade in your apartment. You may be willing to pay more to have an important upgrade or repair done. Don\u2019t bring up a long list of improvements, but asking for one or two upgrades that reflect the new price is usually fair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-make-enticing-offers\">4. <strong>Make enticing offers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l3V0GEwekqtkf5mWk\" title=\"offer\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>When trying to get out of a landlord increased rent, you can try making a compromise. Think about what your landlord might want in return to make an offer they can\u2019t refuse. Here are some things to try:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>If you can see yourself staying in that apartment for a while, offer to renew your <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi\/\">lease<\/a> when it expires.<\/li><li>Offer to pay rent a couple of months ahead in exchange for a rent reduction.<\/li><li>Offer to do something that raises the value of the property, like repainting the walls.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-state-how-good-you-ve-been-as-a-tenant\">5. <strong>State how good you\u2019ve been as a tenant<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you and your roommate(s) have a great tenant track record, use it to your advantage. &nbsp;Bring up how you pay rent early, or how well you\u2019ve taken care of the apartment. Landlords appreciate tenants who are non-disruptive, so remind them how trouble-free you\u2019ve been and how you plan to continue in that way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/new-york-city-rent\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How Much Rent Should I Expect to Pay in NYC?<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-learn-how-much-the-landlord-can-legally-increase-rent\">6. <strong>Learn how much the landlord can legally increase rent<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Get familiar with local and state laws about rent increase and lease renewal processes. Go over your current lease again, and check whether it mentions rent increase rates. This will help you go into rent negotiations being both well prepared and well informed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-timing-matters\">7. <strong>Timing matters<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose your timing well when it comes to rent increase negotiations. It&#8217;s advisable to negotiate rent during these times:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A few months before your lease expires &#8211; you can ask for a lease renewal in exchange for reduced rent.<\/li><li>During winter. Winter is a slow period for landlords since people move more during warmer months. They may be more willing to consider your case if they can&#8217;t find new tenants.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-be-calm\">8. <strong>Be calm<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that your landlord probably has reasons for a rent increase. Being rude or lashing out while trying to negotiate won\u2019t play out well for you. You have to be calm, patient, and respectful, so you don\u2019t risk causing an even larger divide between you and your landlord.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-put-the-deal-in-writing\">9. <strong>Put the deal in writing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:105%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/VFYJXIuuFl6pO\" title=\"writing\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Deals put down in writing have more value, and can\u2019t be easily broken. If your rent negotiations turn out successful, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have it in writing &#8211; signed by both you and your landlord. It may be in your lease renewal document or additional paperwork. Wherever it is, it\u2019ll help you avoid legal issues down the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-if-you-don-t-want-to-talk-directly-you-can-write-a-hardship-letter\">10. If you don\u2019t want to talk directly, you can write a hardship letter<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another alternative you can try is writing a hardship letter. With this letter, you can explain your financial situation and the burden a rent increase would cause for you and\/or your roommate(s). Write the letter as though you&#8217;re in a real conversation, and properly state your case. You can even use some of the tips above, like mentioning that you&#8217;re a good tenant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-do-when-rent-increase-negotiations-fail\">What to do when Rent Increase Negotiations fail?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your negotiations don\u2019t work, and you can\u2019t afford to stay in the apartment anymore, then it may be time to find a new apartment.
