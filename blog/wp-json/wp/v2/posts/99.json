And after snoozing the alarm several times, you finally stumble out of bed and mentally prepare for the week ahead. As you reach the bathroom door to shower, however, you notice it\u2019s locked \u2014 your roommate\u2019s SO got there first. Between \u201cborrowing\u201d your toiletries&nbsp;and hogging your apartment\u2019s best feature \u2014 the in-unit washer\/dryer, of course, he\/she has gradually transitioned from an overnight guest to a live-in partner. We\u2019ve all been there: Your roommate\u2019s boyfriend\/girlfriend doesn&#8217;t leave and is over so often that you\u2019ve gained a new roommate. Who by the way, conveniently lives there rent-free. So, how do you cope when you\u2019re fighting for the right to your own space? And how do you put certain roommate etiquette in place? Take advice from roommates who have successfully navigated the complicated terrain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t&nbsp;bottle up your frustrations when your roommate&#8217;s boyfriend\/girlfriend doesn&#8217;t leave<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though you can certainly sulk in your room and secretly pray they\u2019ll break up. All while you swear you\u2019re not a bad person, but you need your space back! The best solution is confronting them when your roommate&#8217;s boyfriend\/girlfriend doesn&#8217;t leave, as with any roommate problem. Just ask veterinary student Sheena Neidrauer! She learned this lesson the hard way when she had a falling out with a close roommate three years ago. While Neidrauer initially befriended her then-best friend\u2019s boyfriend, she admits his presence at their apartment soon became a major burden.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cIt actually got to be a problem really quickly,\u201d Neidrauer says. \u201cI\u2019d make lunch plans with her and, surprise, he came too. Or we\u2019d all be watching a movie together in the living room. And they\u2019d literally start making out on the floor. Soon I never saw her without him.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Worse still, Neidrauer says her roommate\u2019s boyfriend began to overstay his welcome. Sometimes he&#8217;d be hanging out at their apartment alone in between classes. Not only did he sleep and study there, but he also encroached on their common area without offering to contribute towards rent or utilities. And that&#8217;s never the right roommate etiquette of course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cWe were already in a tight spot having three girls living in an apartment with one shower,\u201d Neidrauer says. \u201cBut we quickly figured out everyone\u2019s schedules, so it was fine. That is until I started waking up to take my shower, and he was in there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a minor inconvenience when it\u2019s a roommate, but when you\u2019ve just woken up and the person in your shower doesn\u2019t even live there, you get really cranky about it really quick. They also cooked all their meals at our place and left the dishes everywhere. \u201c<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Talk about live-in partners before moving in<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, neither Neidrauer nor her roommate spoke about the matter, which ultimately led to the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-fix-your-relationships-with-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">demise of their friendship<\/a>. But, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/traceedunblazier.com\/#4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spiritual empath<\/a> and counselor&nbsp;Tracee Dunblazier, it doesn\u2019t have to end badly. Her advice for dealing when a roommate&#8217;s boyfriend\/girlfriend doesn&#8217;t leave: Everyone (including friends!) should always discuss and have an understanding about the issue&nbsp;<em>before<\/em>&nbsp;living together. If you\u2019re not sure how to broach the somewhat awkward topic, blame it on the landlord.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cIn fact, most apartment leases contain a clause that stipulates any guests staying more than a two-week period of time offers an opportunity for the landlord to raise the rent a percentage,\u201d Dunblazier says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHowever, if the negotiation [with your landlord] hasn\u2019t happened, I would take the opportunity [to confront your roommate] when you witness the first sleepover. That way there won\u2019t be any contention, only excitement of the new liaison.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dunblazier emphasizes the importance of showing appreciation for your roommate\u2019s relationship but suggests setting boundaries as well. So when your roommate&#8217;s boyfriend\/girlfriend doesn&#8217;t leave, follow the following advice. Whether that\u2019s discussing how many days a significant other can stay over, or expressing your discomfort with your roommate\u2019s partner being there without them, Dunblazier says roommates should set ground rules early on.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:73%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/jV4wbvtJxdjnMriYmY\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/jV4wbvtJxdjnMriYmY\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t play the blame game<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While she agrees ground rules are a must, gestalt life coach Nina Rubin also emphasizes that the use of \u201cblaming statements\u201d should never enter the conversation when you speak with your roommate about your proposed guidelines. So if your roommate&#8217;s boyfriend\/girlfriend doesn&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t start blaming them. Instead, have a real conversation about <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/healthy-living-for-you-and-your-roommate-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">house rules<\/a> and roommate etiquette. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s best&nbsp;when confronting a roommate to speak directly and assertively,\u201d Rubin suggests. \u201cRather than viewing this as a \u2018confrontation,\u2019 think of it as an exchange of dialogue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to express what you mean without bringing in other topics. If you\u2019re annoyed that your roommate\u2019s boyfriend is staying over all the time, stick to the topic of overnight guests without blaming them for forgetting to take out the trash or leaving stuff in the living room.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, don\u2019t use the situation at hand to emotionally dump on your roommate things that are completely irrelevant to the conflict. It doesn\u2019t matter how many dishes are piled up in the sink \u2014 now\u2019s not the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Leave the bae out of it as long as possible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, both Rubin and Dunblazier&#8217;s advice for when your roommate&#8217;s boyfriend\/girlfriend doesn&#8217;t leave is as follows. While you should have a conversation with your roommate right when things begin to go awry, you should never confront their significant other unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. This could \u201ccreate a rift and triangulation between the roommates,\u201d Rubin says. But if you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation with their partner, Dunblazier encourages making your feelings known about their prolonged stay in your space and remind them of the basic roommate etiquette they need to follow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI had an experience one time with a roommate whose lover would stay in the house after she left for work,\u201d Dunblazier says. \u201cI brought it up to her three times. And then finally upon waking to find him there again, I told him he needed to leave and that he couldn\u2019t be in our home without her. He was angry but left. In that situation, I didn\u2019t feel safe with him. And as it turns out he ended up assaulting her a few days later.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t accept defeat when your roommate&#8217;s boyfriend\/girlfriend doesn&#8217;t leave<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your roommate&#8217;s boyfriend\/girlfriend doesn&#8217;t leave and you absolutely have to step in and talk to the partner. Then it should be done politely and carefully. Though having an unofficial extra roommate is less than ideal, solving the problem doesn\u2019t have to be messy. Rubin suggests trying to ease any tension by learning more about your roommate\u2019s partner. And even going out as a group to enjoy each other\u2019s company. The better you know them, the less awkward it will be to have them around or to tell them to take a hike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if your roommate chooses to ignore basic roommate etiquette of considering your issues. Or they make your living situation even more difficult,&nbsp;you still have some options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cIf the roommate is hostile or difficult, check the lease. See how long guests are allowed to stay,\u201d Rubin says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cConsider discussing move-out scenarios so everyone can be happy.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be uncomfortable whipping out the paperwork. But your roommate may get the point better if they realize how serious you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers deal with roommate&#8217;s SO not leaving?
