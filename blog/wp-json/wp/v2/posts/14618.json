This could be due to a variety of cases where excess noise is becoming a nuisance to the resident. Dogs barking, loud music, late-night partying, or other loud noises are all grounds for a report. Noise laws for apartment buildings can vary, but there are usually &#8216;quiet hours&#8217; designated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have the right to file a noise complaint if noise rules are being broken as per:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Building &#8216;quiet hours&#8217; or noise regulations<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lease agreement conditions<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Local noise laws and regulations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" data-attachment-id=\"14619\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-report-an-apartment-noise-complaint\/attachment\/irritated-roommate\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"irritated roommate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate-scaled.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"irritated roommate\" class=\"wp-image-14619\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate-scaled.jpg?resize=1568%2C1176&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/irritated-roommate-scaled.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-sleep-with-noisy-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How To Sleep With Noisy Roommates<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Handling noisy neighbors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve all had noisy neighbors at some point and we know how annoying it can be. However, calling the police or filing a noise complaint isn&#8217;t always reasonable. Maybe you and your neighbor just have different work or sleep schedules. There are some things that you can do, before taking these steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/gunpowdersky-gunpowder-and-sky-hearts-beat-loud-eenSmyv5VGhzUNTiWy\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dealing with the noise yourself<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Earbuds or headphones:<\/strong> If your noisy neighbors are hampering your sleep, consider investing in a pair of foam earbuds. They are a cheap and easy way to cancel out the noise and sleep better. If these aren&#8217;t enough, try <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Wireless-Canceling-Headphones\/dp\/B08WZXP336\/ref=sr_1_3?crid=65NHYKUO6NWA&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=sony+wh-1000xm4&amp;qid=1624335004&amp;sprefix=sony+wh%2Caps%2C447&amp;sr=8-3\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">noise-canceling headphones<\/a> instead. These are much more effective when it comes to cutting out the noise and can be great if you like falling asleep to music.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Soundproofing:<\/strong> If you want a better way to dampen the noisy neighbors, consider soundproofing your rooms. Installing soundproofing panels on the walls or lining the gap in your door can help cut the noise. Soundproofing panels are fairly cheap and can be found online on sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/TRUE-NORTH-Acoustic-Panels-Thick\/dp\/B08VWP4Z71\/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=soundproof+panels&amp;qid=1624334981&amp;sr=8-3-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFUNkJKUlYzU0gwWTkmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA1Mzc3NDcxNzJWREhCUEU3NDgxJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzNTU3MjcxTkNBMzBONThMQ0FDJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon<\/a> with free shipping.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>White noise:<\/strong> If you are having trouble falling asleep with all the noise, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/HoMedics-Portable-Relaxing-Soothing-Charging\/dp\/B07DDJFF1F\/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=white+noise+machine&amp;qid=1624335035&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyMTkzUFE4M1JHQVc1JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzA5NzU4MzE3OEtHTUJZUE05RCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzU4NzgxMkozWFVLMTJFNzRVNCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">white noise machine<\/a> may help.

Before you report your complaint, it is important you check the noise laws for buildings in your area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understand the laws or regulations<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Different counties can have different regulations, and you can check for your specific area online. Even your buildings may have regulations and quiet hours that can be found in your lease agreement. Understand what the regulations and your rights are before you file the apartment noise complaint. If you have a noise complaint for dogs barking, also check the pet policy of the property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Report the problem<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is an outlined process for dealing with noise complaints, follow it and report the issue. If there isn&#8217;t, you can write a letter to the relevant person, whether it is the property owner or manager. Be sure to include the issues you are facing and for how long they have persisted. If you have tried to deal with the problem yourself by talking to the noisy neighbors, mention that too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if the problem persists<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have reported your apartment noise complaint and the issue persists, write a follow-up to the concerned authority. Be sure to keep records of all your communications and reports as well. If the issue carries on after multiple reports, you may want to contact law enforcement. You can look up the non-emergency phone number or email ID and contact them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/cat-breeds-for-small-apartments\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">5 Cat Breeds For Small Apartments<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to deal with an apartment noise complaint<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have found yourself on the receiving end of an apartment noise complaint, here is what you should do.

Explain the situation to them and assure them that it will not be an issue again. You can share your phone number with your neighbor too. This way they can directly contact you if they have any noise issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Respect quiet hours<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you party, play loud music, or have a noisy hobby, be sure that you are being reasonable with the noise you make.
