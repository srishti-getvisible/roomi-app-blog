Especially in today&#8217;s age where we&#8217;re all used to our fast-paced life of oversaturation. The lockdowns imposed across the world forced us all to find new things to do with our time. And some of the questions we found ourselves pondering over were: <br>What do we do with our time in self-isolation? How can we take this time to nurture the best versions of ourselves? And how can we hack self-development through creativity?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to stay informed about the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/2020\/03\/17\/things-to-know-nyc-coronavirus-pandemic\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">coronavirus pandemic in New York<\/a>.
