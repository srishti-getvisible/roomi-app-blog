If feminism is the way of the household you have just moved into, buckle up to be pleasantly surprised. Wondering why? Here\u2019s what your feminist roommate wants you to know about modern feminism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s feminists are less about fighting for women\u2019s rights and more about promoting gender equality. Despite feminism\u2019s historically bad rap, it isn\u2019t the extremist, man-hating movement that it has often been painted to be. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you missed it, actress and UN Women Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson started an uproar this past summer. She launched the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.heforshe.org\/en\">HeForShe campaign<\/a><\/strong> where she championed feminism by offering a fresh perspective.&nbsp;Modern feminists can teach us a lot about true equality. But there&#8217;s also a growing population of men that are standing up to advocate for the movement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/the-dos-and-donts-of-sharing-an-apartment-for-the-first-time\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Do&#8217;s And Don&#8217;ts Of Sharing An Apartment For The First Time<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It\u2019s&nbsp;Not a Negative Word<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the existing hate in this world, we think it&#8217;s best to NOT believe that your feminist roommate is on an extremist agenda. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like a radical ideology, feminism is often associated with an extreme and aggressive agenda. Something that involves hating men and rejecting traditionally feminine lifestyles. Wrongfully, living under the socially constructed umbrella, Watson pointed out the following in her speech. Feminists are then said to be \u201ctoo strong, too aggressive, isolating, anti-men, and unattractive.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other negative connotations include the assumptions that feminists are anti-marriage, self-entitled, and overly sensitive about compliments. But these antiquated ideas couldn\u2019t be more wrong and detrimental to feminism\u2019s core principles, says New York-based fashion tech entrepreneur and proud feminist,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mitalirakhit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">Mitali Rakhit<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIt does not mean that I want to burn my bra or hate all men,\u201d she says. It\u2019s most heartbreaking to me when I see a &nbsp;woman who shies away from calling herself a feminist.

Except in the case that there is systematic maltreatment of women in comparison to men,\u201d says Rakhit. \u201cI would want my new roommate to know that being a feminist means you think men and women should have equal rights.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It\u2019s About Advocating for Women Who Have Nothing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You could say many&nbsp;women-focused philanthropy initiatives are inherently feminist today. Why? because in many countries, women live in destitution and oppression simply from the lack of basic rights. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalcitizen.org\/en\/issue\/women-girls\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Global Citizen Project<\/a>, for example, is a well-known organization. This organization has recruited world leaders to take a stand for bettering the lives of women everywhere. Would you call them feminists? Absolutely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cThere is a world of women, far away from the eyes of Western media, who cannot speak up for themselves because no one will listen,\u201d says Rakhit, who volunteered in a&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.scoopwhoop.com\/inothernews\/red-light-areas-india\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">red-light district<\/a>&nbsp;in eastern India for two years, where thousands of women lack basic human rights. \u201cThe lives of women in the lower and working classes are seen as having no value to most of society, particularly in the eyes of men.&nbsp;They\u2019re not seen as being economic assets to their families, as men are, and are therefore more likely to married off as quickly as possible so they can be someone else\u2019s \u2018problem.\u2019 As a result, they\u2019re pulled out of school at a young age and often get abused by their in-laws as well. It was shocking how many formerly trafficked women I had met were married.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It\u2019s Just as Much About Men as Women<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A hallmark of modern feminism\u2019s ideology is changing the dialogue&nbsp;to include both men and women, so that both genders can come together to propagate for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 equality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cMen must be a part of the conversation and the solution, otherwise there is little hope of changing the landscape as it currently stands. The dialogue around feminism must have both genders included in it. Awareness and education is key,\u201d says Rakhit.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>Lol how do you call yourself a feminist but you\u2019re against&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/InternationalMensDay?src=hash\" class=\"broken_link\">#InternationalMensDay<\/a>? \u2014 anal girl (@benadryI)&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/benadryI\/status\/667423651822702592\" class=\"broken_link\">November 19, 2015<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Feminists today also feel strongly about eliminating stereotypes and boxing in women&nbsp;<em>or<\/em>&nbsp;men to traditional gender roles. Just as women&nbsp;experience their share of unfair treatment and double standards, men also experience an expectation to&nbsp;maintain a sense of \u201cmanliness,\u201d \u2014 something that&nbsp;modern feminists reject. Emma Watson explained this well in her speech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cBoth men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong\u2026 It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum, not as two opposing sets of ideals. If we stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by what we are, we can all be freer.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where do we go from here?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it shortly, those who think feminism is an offensive word are, by and large, those most threatened by the idea of women as equal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The safest bet is to be open and understanding. At the end of the day, you and your roommate will get along better and grow individually if you can learn to accept each other\u2019s differences as well as similarities. And if you still don\u2019t get it, just remember: Even though their values may not be easy to understand, they\u2019re still valuable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers understand their feminist roommates better?
