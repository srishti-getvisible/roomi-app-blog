As you settle into a job (or maybe a job hunt), you think: <em>Roommates again? No sweat, I\u2019ve done a good job with college roommate search and lived with other people for the last four years, I got this.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While at first it\u2019s going to feel like the same thing you\u2019ve done all through college with college roommates \u2014 sharing living space, making frozen pizza, lots of Netflix \u2014 it\u2019s not a carbon copy. As you settle into this new season of life and carry on your outside of college roommate search, you\u2019ll start to realize the differences, both subtle and unavoidable. When you\u2019re entering a new co-living situation, it\u2019s important to know what factors might get in the way of a successful relationship. Here are some things to consider when comparing post-grad and college roommates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Managing money with college roommates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/advice-for-college-graduates-covid-19-edition-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">working world<\/a> can be a terrifying place at first. There\u2019s business casual dress codes, meetings, awkward happy hours \u2014 oh, and there\u2019s also a paycheck! Depending on your new out of college roommate search and your new job, this could mean a lot of things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You both have paychecks and you can afford nice things unlike your college roommates. (Like cloth napkins and DVR!)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You make more money than your roommate. And feel weird asking for money when you swipe for pizza or ask about that bill.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You make less than he or she does. It\u2019s hard to explain why you have to pass on a cruise with your buddies or a weekend getaway.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You both are short on cash and coming up with rent is hard.&nbsp;See? Lots of room for <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/out-of-the-college-into-the-real-world-financial-tips-to-start-saving-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">different finances<\/a> as you get on your feet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Open communication is key<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeremi Gill, 22, works in public relations in Manhattan and lives with four college roommates. As the sole tenant on the lease, he says paying for rent can be a stressful time of the month.&nbsp;Since his college roommates aren\u2019t in the same financial situation, he\u2019s been known to spot them for rent here and there. Had it not been for their open communication, things could have gotten ugly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cI had to pay it for him and check in with him every few days to see when he was getting his paycheck,\u201d Gill says about one of his roommates.<br><br> That created some stress, as he guaranteed me there would be no problems, and already on the first month I was having to cover for him with my own finances. But no love lost.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Different schedules<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember how you could skip class as a student to sneak in a nap? Those were the days! As a big kid, those options are few and far in between. If your college roommate is not on the same schedule as you, his or her activities could affect your precious sleep, and showing up at work groggy isn\u2019t an option. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Gill, his daily work routine drastically differs from that of his college roommates \u2014 which, on one hand, isn\u2019t so bad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cOnce I started spending my entire day at work, I started having a desire to make the most use of my mornings,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead of sleeping in until work, I started getting up a couple hours earlier to work out and eat a decent breakfast. I\u2019m always the first one up. On the flip side, once I come back from work the evening is mine to rest and relax. While my roommates are all bent over their books, flipping through flashcards and writing papers. I am trying out new recipes in the kitchen and writing letters to my friends.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make boundaries right at the start<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Without sounding like a camp counselor, be upfront about the time you need to catch better Zs. After you&#8217;re done with your college roommate search and you find a good match, laying down some ground rules in a&nbsp;roommate contract&nbsp;is a good idea. Coming to an agreement that any coming-and-goings after a certain time should be ninja-like will avoid conflict at home and ensure everyone gets their beauty sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"11926\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/life-side-college-vs-post-grad-roommates\/attachment\/college-roommates-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1-scaled.jpeg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"college-roommates-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1-scaled.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"college roommates having a conversation \" class=\"wp-image-11926\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1-scaled.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/college-roommates-1-scaled.jpeg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Different style of relationships<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.society19.com\/pros-cons-of-being-in-a-relationship-in-college\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">significant other<\/a> and he or she is going to be spending time around your place, lay it out upfront with your college roommates. If you\u2019re one to have guests drop in often, that\u2019s good to know too. College living situations tend to be more forgiving when six of your besties from high school visit for a football game or your boyfriend is a regular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don&#8217;t keep them in the dark<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But things are a little trickier in the post-grad life. Whether or not you\u2019re seeing someone seriously, it\u2019s always a good idea to have the \u201covernight guest talk.\u201d Let your college roommate know who\u2019ll going be to coming in and out. Especially if they\u2019ve got a spare key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Strange, new frontier with college roommates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the biggest difference in post-college roommates is the sheer variety of people you might end up living with. Learning how to share a home with different characters can be challenging at times. Mackenzie, another PR professional from Manhattan (who chose to stay partially anonymous for this article) knows this quite well. She&nbsp;rents a room on Long Island and lives with an older roommate. They both rent from a family friend, but their age gap makes for some well-meaning, but awkward moments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cOccasionally, it still feels like I\u2019m a kid, because my roommate has two children that are both older than I am, so, as she put it once, I\u2019m \u2018still a baby,\u2019\u2019\u2019 she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be condescending, but it certainly highlighted a stark difference in our positions and ages.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Try to find the common middle ground<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you come home and need to vent about your coworkers or something going on at work, you may be disappointed with the lack of sympathy from your roommate if you can\u2019t really relate. And that goes both ways.&nbsp;Be understanding and avoid belittling if your roommate needs an ear. In the same vein, find a confidant on your path if your roommate\u2019s not interested in listening to your play-by-play of office life. After all, you don\u2019t&nbsp;<em>have<\/em> to be best friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, distance can be a good thing. If you\u2019re both doing your own things on different schedules, there\u2019s less overlap in social circles. Fewer connections often equals friction. Plus, hearing from someone whose days are completely different than yours can lend a whole new perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What differences have you experienced living with a college versus a post-grad roommate?
