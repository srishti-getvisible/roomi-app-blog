This is one of the best apartment hacks that will give your home a personality on a budget!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/gfswDfGrHK0ipUICgf\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/gfswDfGrHK0ipUICgf\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Life hacks for the plant lovers!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing, we repeat NOTHING elevates a space more than a houseplant. From succulents to cacti- there are different types and sizes for every type of home. Start off with a couple and add to your collection if and when you can. There\u2019s no such thing as too much when it comes to our green friends. Roomi team recommends the snake plant, it&#8217;s a favorite over here. And while we\u2019re on the topic of how much we *love* plants, did we mention how good they are for you? They purify the air, boost your mood and can even reduce symptoms of mild stress and anxiety? The power of mother nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure about what plants to get, here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/savvygardening.com\/apartment-plants\/\">really helpful guide<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/iFIrBBc1Ax138lz4LE\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/iFIrBBc1Ax138lz4LE\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use books as decoration<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If got heaps of books and random knick-knacks lying around at home, this one&#8217;s for you. Instead of hiding them under your bed never to be seen again, consider piling them on your coffee table, near the couch or even stacking them on some shelves near framed photos. Super affordable without looking \u2018cheap\u2019, decorating with books is a trick used by interior designers all over the globe. It&#8217;s truly one of the classiest life hacks of all time! From<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/6-travel-books-for-your-wandering-soul-roomi\/\"> travel books<\/a> to your favorite fictional tale- they add color and personality to your space! And what\u2019s not to love about showing off how well-read you are?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Portable home bars and trolleys<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of our favorite life hacks! If you\u2019ve got wine bottles taking up valuable space on your kitchen counters, it\u2019s time to give them a proper home. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s time to organize your booze! How very adult of you. We recommend getting a cheap and cheerful bar cart or home trolley. Not only are they great for entertaining, but they add character and color to any home. Another bonus? When your friends leave bottles behind, you can simply pop them on to your bar and add to your collection or tasty d\u00e9cor. Win, win!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you want some inspiration, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecturaldigest.com\/gallery\/the-29-best-bar-carts-under-dollar500\">here&#8217;s a really helpful list <\/a>of portable home bars starting at $49!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:66%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/gdxTPTUo9PMg5Vhmma\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/gdxTPTUo9PMg5Vhmma\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Invest in your lighting<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People often forget about lighting when they&#8217;re redecorating and it&#8217;s a big mistake! When you first walk into a room, one of the first things people tend to notice is the lighting. This is one of those cheap life hacks that will completely transform your home without much effort! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many rental apartments come with standard (and not so stylish) lighting fixtures. So, mixing it up with your own light shades, floor lamps and table lamps will make all the difference. From industrial Scandinavian vibes to bohemian style rattan and bold, statement colors, the options are endless. Not only can you change the whole appearance of your apartment whilst remaining within your budget, but there\u2019s something super cozy and welcoming about warm, low lights. Apartment hacks FTW!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:54%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/H1SRwGbmIosPW3wtUu\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/H1SRwGbmIosPW3wtUu\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Whatever you do, don\u2019t pressure yourself to get things done straight away.
