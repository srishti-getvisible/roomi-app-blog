Uber has taken over all major cities around the world, including NYC. So, it\u2019s no surprise that that might be the go-to for most youngsters in the city. But there&#8217;s just something so iconic about the NYC yellow taxi cab. I mean, you can\u2019t really picture the city without thinking of those yellow cabs driving all over NYC. It\u2019s practically the soul of the city. But as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/10\/12\/nyregion\/nyc-coronavirus-subway-crime.html\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Uber<\/a> has taken over the city in the past few years, we\u2019ve all found ourselves asking- which option is better? And more importantly, which one is cheaper?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019ve just <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/the-perks-of-co-living-in-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">moved<\/a> to NYC and genuinely want to know or just bored at home with nothing else to do, we\u2019ve got all the info you need! So without any further ado, here\u2019s our comprehensive guide traveling around NYC: Cab addition!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:68%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/QOuNRNHKG9K86NkcKK\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/QOuNRNHKG9K86NkcKK\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/what-to-look-for-in-short-term-rentals-in-nyc\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">What to Look for in Short Term Rentals in NYC<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nyc-taxi-or-uber-which-is-better\">NYC Taxi or Uber: Which is better?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-an-uber-better-than-a-taxi-in-nyc\">Is an Uber better than a Taxi in NYC?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We don\u2019t need to explain to you what uber is, you\u2019ve probably already used it a hundred times. But even if you haven\u2019t they\u2019re actually not that different from a regular taxi. In fact, they\u2019re pretty similar to a yellow taxi cab in how they calculate fares. It\u2019s a combination of the time and distance with an additional fare of any tolls added at the&nbsp; end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-you-ll-need-a-phone\">You\u2019ll need a phone!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course, the big difference is, you need a working smartphone and an internet connection to book yourself an Uber. So, if you ever find yourself with a dead phone in NYC, uber is not an option for you. Unless, of course, you want to endure the humiliation of going up to a total stranger and asking to use their phone (which, just FYI, is a terrible choice in NYC).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rating-system-ftw\">Rating system FTW!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\u2019s a lot of ways in which Uber proves itself to be very useful. First of all, you get to check the rating of the Driver (and they get to see yours as well). If they\u2019ve got a good rating, you can get in the Uber without much stress. You can even share your ride with a friend to be even more cautious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber is also extremely proactive about getting <a href=\"https:\/\/help.uber.com\/riders\/article\/how-to-contact-support?_csid=tftARz7iRs3LbSqoWjt0Cg&amp;nodeId=4c69afef-5739-4842-9e98-ed0087b873db&amp;state=kjQb7yU1l8Giz_5UZEvEVLc2sdpdNSn6EO12tCipZ4M%3D\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">feedback<\/a> from the customer. So, if you have a bad experience, you can report it instantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-availability\">Availability!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber is especially useful if you find yourselves in the Suburbs of NYC. Because, while taxi cabs are abundant in the city, you\u2019ll have a real hard time flagging one down once you\u2019re out in the suburbs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now that you\u2019ve got a pretty well-rounded understanding of getting an Uber in NYC, let\u2019s move onto yellow taxis!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:49%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/efldAuBaaiiqNPaRGE\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/efldAuBaaiiqNPaRGE\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/nyc-winter-essentials-what-should-i-pack-for-new-york-in-winter\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYC Winter Essentials:&nbsp;What should I pack for New York in winter?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.roomiapp.android&amp;utm_source=lifestyle%2Fuber-or-taxi-in-nyc-which-is-better%2F&amp;utm_campaign=find-roommates&amp;pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1\" class=\"broken_link\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/play.google.com\/intl\/en_us\/badges\/static\/images\/badges\/en_badge_web_generic.png?resize=250%2C78&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"250\" ;=\"\" height=\"78\" border-radius=\"13\"><\/a>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/roommates-by-roomi\/id690346626?itsct=apps_box_badge&#038;amp%3Bitscg=30200&#038;utm_source=lifestyle%2Fuber-or-taxi-in-nyc-which-is-better%2F&#038;utm_medium=us-blog-lifestyle&#038;utm_campaign=download-on-the-appstore&#038;utm_id=app-store-badge&#038;utm_content=uber-or-taxi-comparison-nyc\" style=\"display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 13px; width: 215px; height: 80px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/tools.applemediaservices.com\/api\/badges\/download-on-the-app-store\/black\/en-us?size=250x83&amp;releaseDate=1381968000&amp;h=203537ad333f49d5525e1819c4d98b34\" alt=\"Download on the App Store\" style=\"border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px; class: center;\"><\/bgcolor=\"#ffffff\";>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-is-a-taxi-better-than-uber-in-nyc\">Is a Taxi better than Uber in NYC?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh what can we say about the New York yellow taxi cab that hasn\u2019t been said before? I mean, it\u2019s an indispensable part of the NYC experience. Just watch any of the thousand movies set in NYC, and we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll find at least a dozen taxis in all the outdoor shots. Yeah, it\u2019s an integral part of the city. But of course, times have changed and perhaps, the taxi might be one of those things that will slowly fade away. After all, aren\u2019t all these new transportation apps supposed to be cheaper anyway?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-actually-cheaper\">It\u2019s actually cheaper!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019d think that but, surprisingly no, a taxi cab is still cheaper than an Uber in NYC. To be precise, <a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1503.03021\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">study<\/a> from the University of Cambridge has found that a taxi cab is generally cheaper for shorter trips. Once a trip costs more than $35, then an Uber is likely going to be cheaper for you. But even then, it\u2019s a toss up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-readily-available\">Readily Available<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellow taxi cabs are everywhere in NYC. Honestly, just wave once as you\u2019re standing at the curb and you\u2019ll find like 10 taxis. Of course, be prepared to be yelled at if flag down a taxi around for no reason in NYC. You don\u2019t need a smartphone or an internet connection to get a taxi, one flailing arm will do. So, if you\u2019re in the City and in need of a cab immediately, a yellow taxi wins hands down!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-customer-service-and-feedback\">Customer service and feedback<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not unheard of to have a bad experience with your cab driver. But the procedure to report such an incident is not as instant as it is with Uber. For starters, The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission mandates that all taxis have a passenger bill of rights inside the cab that drivers and cab owners must adhere to. If you want to file an official complaint, you need to dial 311 or go online and report the incident through this <a href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/tlc\/about\/filing-complaint-with-tlc.page\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">form<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3o6Zt2RqEvIEwn452w\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3o6Zt2RqEvIEwn452w\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-so-who-wins-the-uber-vs-taxi-debate-in-nyc\">So, who wins the Uber vs. Taxi debate in NYC?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, both an Uber and a Taxi have their pros and cons in NYC. Of course, team Roomi will always suggest the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains\/\">subway<\/a> if you\u2019re in NYC. But we understand that many people aren\u2019t yet comfortable taking the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/10\/12\/nyregion\/nyc-coronavirus-subway-crime.html\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">subway<\/a> because of the pandemic. But if a cab is your only option, we recommend going with an NYC yellow taxi. It\u2019s cheaper, easily available and honestly, it\u2019s an integral part of living in NYC that you must enjoy at least once!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers figure out whether they should get an Uber or a Taxi in NYC?
