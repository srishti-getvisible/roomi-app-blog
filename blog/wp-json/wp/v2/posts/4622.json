Our roommate doesn\u2019t have to be our best friend and it\u2019s normal to get into disagreements with one another when you&#8217;re practically living on top of each other every day. If you&#8217;re having roommate problems, don\u2019t freak out, here are a few tips that\u2019ll help you smoothen this relationship bump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Communicate with your roomi when something is bothering you<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/QZ0vFWrpgccsZz4tNh\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/QZ0vFWrpgccsZz4tNh\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Communication is the answer to every question! If you and your roomi have gotten into a fight, it\u2019s important to not ignore them and instead face the issue. This is the person you\u2019re sharing a home with, so it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t have any bad blood between the two of you. Immediately address the issue at hand instead of letting the anger build up inside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did your roommate do something that rubbed you the wrong way? Let them know! Finding out each other\u2019s boundaries is crucial when creating a healthy home environment. Set limits with one another and be respectful of your roomi&#8217;s limits. This can help you keep a majority of roommate problems at bay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Good listening skills can help you stay clear of roommate problems<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:55%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3o7bucZfOGGG4gWlPy\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/much-fail-3o7bucZfOGGG4gWlPy\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Just as it\u2019s important for you to tell your roomi when something is bothering you, it\u2019s important that you listen to your roomi when they talk to you. Let your roomi know that you acknowledge their feelings and concerns. Even if you don\u2019t agree with what they&#8217;re saying, make an effort to listen, and work together to come to a compromise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Talk to a friend about the problems you&#8217;ve been having your roommate<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:83%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/RiiIImVSYLD7rWrkq9\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/RiiIImVSYLD7rWrkq9\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t know how to bring up an issue that&#8217;s bothering you directly to your roommate? Reach out to a close friend or family member and talk about the problems you&#8217;re having with your roommate. Talking is extremely therapeutic and it can be helpful to get another person\u2019s perspective on a situation. Ask your friend or family member their thoughts on how to approach your roommate with the issue at hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Create your own space<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/9tx0gy37p7oXu\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/9tx0gy37p7oXu\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important that you have your own space when living with a roommate. Whether this space is your bedroom or at a friend\u2019s house, find somewhere you can chill and have downtime separate from your roomi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you and your roomi don\u2019t get along, it\u2019s okay if you make plans for time away from them. Crash at a friend\u2019s house or spend time at your favorite coffee shop &#8211; find a place that you enjoy in order to give yourself a break from being at home and help to maintain a positive outlook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Clean up after yourself and respect your roomi<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/9PtfS5tTC8ejlYfCLU\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/9PtfS5tTC8ejlYfCLU\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Relationships are a two-way street, so make sure you\u2019re being a good roommate as well. Whenever you\u2019re done cooking, be sure to take care of the dishes and put away any food that you\u2019ve taken out. If you have friends over and they make a mess, be sure to clean up after them. If you make it clear to your roomi that you respect their space, they will most likely do the same. This practice will help you avoid roommate problems<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-be-a-good-roommate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Be a Good Roommate?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. If all else fails, move out<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/S5ExJ6xbV0l9Eo9gWW\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/S5ExJ6xbV0l9Eo9gWW\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>If being with your roomi is really unbearable and nothing else has worked, it\u2019s okay to move out and find another place. Stay with a friend or move in with the fam while you look for a new apartment. If moving out simply isn&#8217;t an option, you and your roomi will have to work out a situation that works for both of you &#8211; even if that means planning your schedules so you don&#8217;t run into each other in communal areas too often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers with their roommate problems?
