Splitting the rent and paying utility bills on time is important for everyone in the house. However, if your roommate has a genuine reason to not pay the rent on time- it\u2019s okay! Financial situations may go up and down once in a while for everyone. It\u2019s okay to wait a day or two if your roommate is not able to pay the bills, but you can send them a gentle reminder to let them know that it\u2019s rent day. ?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Splitting bills with roommates can get even more complicated when you make lots of shared purchases. Grabbing margaritas at the weekend, ordering pizza for dinner, or buying furniture for the home? All too often, one person fronts the bill and the others take far too long to pay it back.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/1wXbfwqsoM8buAzZjw\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/1wXbfwqsoM8buAzZjw\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>This can again cause a lot of anxiety and unnecessary stress. <strong>Unless you guys are mathematicians, there are some <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/3-awesome-apps-splitting-bills-roommates\/\">excellent apps that you can use for splitting bills with roommates<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-5-setting-boundaries-in-between-all-the-sharing\">5.

And if you are a Joey who doesn\u2019t share food, it\u2019s okay to let your roommate know. Just remember: that also means you can&#8217;t help yourself to their snacks&#8230; no matter how good they may look!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:83%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/llToceLTKQj0R1Asid\" title=\"joey doesnt share\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>Boundaries especially come into play when you talk about privacy<\/strong>.

Say, for example, your laptop suddenly stops working one day and you decide to work on your roommate\u2019s laptop. <strong>And what about <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/sharing-wifi-with-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sharing wifi with roommates<\/a>?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/XMC67UHffXHrUIJGpn\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/XMC67UHffXHrUIJGpn\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>It seems <em>natural<\/em> to hack resources but this is a strict no-no.
