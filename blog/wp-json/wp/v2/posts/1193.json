In 2020, we found the entire world locked in their homes, only stepping out for essentials. But we also found ourselves confused about what the term &#8220;essential&#8221; really means. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 also brought us to terms with the idea that we&#8217;re now living in an era where rules are constantly changing. Be it the NYC lockdown caused by disease or other reasons. The point is that things are changing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 also became the year with so many new rules governing how we live. How can we tell if we&#8217;re breaking the law by doing something as simple as shopping?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question we&#8217;re answering today is, what does a lockdown in NYC look like? What were some of the key inferences of the NYC lockdown of 2020?
