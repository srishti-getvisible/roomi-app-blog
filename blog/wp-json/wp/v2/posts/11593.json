You\u2019ve found an <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/bad-credit-when-finding-an-apartment-in-nyc-heres-help\/\">apartment<\/a> to match your budget, signed a lease, got renter\u2019s insurance. Now it\u2019s time for the fun stuff- decorating the space! So what if your apartment is tiny? Getting to decorate your own place is one of the most exciting things ever! Now, your place can be a reflection of your personality and taste alone! No more posters of movies that you haven\u2019t watched. No more of that ugly chair of your <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/4-ways-to-refresh-home-decor-in-a-shared-apartment-roomi\/\">roommate\u2019s<\/a> that clashed with your table. Now YOU get to decide everything! But deciding on the interior decor of a small apartment is tough. You want the place to feel like you, but it\u2019s also incredibly easy to overdo a tiny space. Which is why Roomi has got amazing apartment hacks for your small rental apartment! These hacks will completely transform your space, trust us!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One of the best apartment hacks for a tiny apartment: buy only multifunctional furniture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re living in a small apartment, functionality is key. Yes, an exotic statement furniture piece looks lovely, but it\u2019s also taking up a lot of space that could be used for more practical things. For instance, a sofa-cum-bed is one of the best hacks for a small rental apartment. Not only will you have sleeping space for when guests stay over, you get a kickass couch as well! Honestly, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/\">Ikea<\/a> will be your best friend when trying to find multifunctional furniture. That store is just full of amazing apartment hacks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you don\u2019t always have to sacrifice aesthetics for functionality. You can have both! Look at this amazing vintage trunk that doubles as a coffee table! It\u2019s both beautiful to look at while also providing storage space!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/405394403928113613\/\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-pinterest\">https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/405394403928113613\/<\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">One of Roomi\u2019s favorite apartment hacks: portable home bar<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having your friends over for drinks and dinner is one of the most fun parts of having an apartment. But investing in a bar is often unnecessary and expensive. And leaving out half-empty bottles of booze just doesn\u2019t look good. So, what do you do? Well, let us introduce to you one of our favorite small rental apartment hacks- portable home bars! These home bars take up very little space and look amazing! You can even scour local thrift stores to find a trolley and convert it into your very own home bar! I mean just look at this one, isn\u2019t it just fantastic?! Now you can get a party started without much hassle!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/152278031139003390\/\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-pinterest\">https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/152278031139003390\/<\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Store stuff under your furniture<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, an apartment with adequate <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/7-storage-hacks-that-will-transform-your-home-roomi\/\">storage<\/a> space might actually be a myth at this point. So, you can imagine it\u2019s even harder for people with small apartments. So, what do you do? Well, for starters, you buy furniture that has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecturaldigest.com\/gallery\/best-storage-beds\">space<\/a> underneath. Ottoman bed frames are one of the best apartment hacks for you. Not only do they look great, you also get storage along with it. You should also invest in these beautiful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hosroome-Handmade-Storage-Decorative-Organizing\/dp\/B07MYS6YD9\">wicker baskets<\/a>! It\u2019s one of the best hacks for a small rental apartment because they make <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-organize-your-space-while-coliving-in-nyc\/\">organizing<\/a> your stuff so easy without compromising on aesthetics!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Invest in a round dining table<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019re an adult, eating dinner in your bed just loses its appeal. I mean, it just feels more adult to have your meals on a dinner table. But if you\u2019re living in a small space, large dining tables are just not feasible. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still eat like an adult. Just buy a round dining table. Not only are they so chic, they\u2019re also one of the greatest space-saving apartment hacks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/784541197582432471\/\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-pinterest\">https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/784541197582432471\/<\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get overhead lights<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re choosing the decor for a small apartment, it\u2019s important to not crowd the floors. And it is ridiculously easy to crowd a small apartment. Four pieces of furniture and boom! There\u2019s no more space left to walk. So, how do you make your space beautiful without everything feeling too overstuffed? Well, overhead lights are the most beautiful hacks for a small rental apartment. The more your space is lit up, the more spacious it will feel. Not to mention, hanging lamps are some of the most gorgeous pieces of decor on this planet. I mean, just look at how these hanging lights completely transform the space!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/652107221039421400\/\" class=\"wp-block-jetpack-pinterest\">https:\/\/in.pinterest.com\/pin\/652107221039421400\/<\/a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get creative!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, at the end of the day, only you know your space the best. So, get creative! Take all those weird nooks and crannies of your apartment and turn them into beautiful corners. That\u2019s what will make your space unique and feel like home! Just remember to stay calm and enjoy the process, you\u2019ll miss it when it\u2019s over!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:66%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/Ymtw5fjm9Nl01J2aqC\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/Ymtw5fjm9Nl01J2aqC\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find great design hacks for their small rental apartment?
