You will not be ripped off, scammed, or bamboozled in any way, shape, or form. Right? Hold on there, tiger. Here are three common housing issues in NYC that you\u2019ll want to check in any apartment you\u2019re considering.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Everything You Need To Know About Lease Signing In New York<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ground-floor-apartments-are-cheaper-for-a-reason\"><b>Ground Floor Apartments Are Cheaper For A Reason<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This one&#8217;s probably the easiest to miss, out of all the housing issues in NYC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/images.pexels.com\/photos\/378570\/pexels-photo-378570.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"New york city street with views of apartments, depicting traffic and the many housing issues in NYC\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That ground-floor apartment caught your eye all right. It\u2019s the least crazy-expensive option in the building. You don\u2019t have to fret about feeling like a Sherpa as you haul groceries up several stories on a bi-weekly basis. But why is it the cheapest, exactly? Pests, crime, and traffic. That\u2019s why.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pests\"><b>Pests<\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cockroaches are appallingly durable little critters, but do you think they relish the idea of scaling the side of a skyscraper and clinging on for dear life just to snack on some tasty garbage? Of course,<\/span> you don\u2019t. Because that would involve thinking about consuming trash and that\u2019s weird. But bugs prefer to infest bottom floor apartments because there is<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> more cover and less exposure to predators.<\/span> Even in NYC, pest control is a pressing issue for ground-floor apartments.

Do you think a burglar feels any different doing it in reverse? It\u2019s not as if they got into the burglary biz because of their sterling work ethic. Burglars often focus on bottom-floor apartments. More cover, less time. Lower exposure to the police. So, uh . . . for the exact same reasons, cockroaches prefer them, basically.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-traffic\"><b>Traffic<\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York never sleeps. Anyone who\u2019s lived in a bottom-floor apartment with headlights constantly blazing through the window like photonic scythes harvesting sweet dreams can attest to that. Cars pulling in and out, people walking by and talking, laughing, or arguing, the occasional late-night crazy person doing . . . something. Something puzzling, morbidly intriguing, and undeniably loud. So if you\u2019re looking to save some cash by sticking to the ground floor, check those windows and check them well. They should form a solid seal to diminish sound, and the shades should be made of solid material that you can pull down and block out light on demand. Those slotted Venetian blinds are like sieves for headlights. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/the-dos-and-donts-of-sharing-an-apartment-for-the-first-time\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Do&#8217;s And Don&#8217;ts Of Sharing An Apartment For The First Time<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-top-floor-new-york-apartments-are-so-hot\"><b>Top Floor New York Apartments Are So Hot<\/b>!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not sultry hot, just muggy hot. Hot air rises to the top floor. In the sweltering summer of New York, the apartments higher up can be miserable if the dehumidifiers aren\u2019t up to the task. Increased heat and humidity put the apartment at risk for mold and mildew. So make sure the HVAC system can take the heat and keep the apartment comfortable. Even if it can, expect to pay considerably more for utilities in the summer. Although you won\u2019t have to fork over as much of your hard-earned cash once winter comes around.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-going-down-elevator-certification\"><b>Going Down? Elevator Certification<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elevators in New York apartments and around town are so common they just fade into the background. Like pink flamingos in Florida or swimming pools in Arizona. It\u2019s easy to forget that those things can break, and when they do, it could well mean you\u2019re walking until they get it fixed. When was the last time your apartment building\u2019s elevator got checked out? It should have a certificate in the elevator itself. Scope them out before you commit to signing a lease. Not just the one you plan to use because it\u2019s closest to your room, but the backup options as well.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever missed something while looking at New York apartments?
