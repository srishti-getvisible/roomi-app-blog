For example, &#8220;efficiency apartments&#8221; and &#8220;studio apartments&#8221; &#8211; aren&#8217;t those the same thing? Well, no. Studio apartments and efficiency apartments are very similar, but there are some key differences between the two of them. Today, we are going to answer the question of, what is an efficiency apartment? To help you decide whether an efficiency apartment could work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-an-efficiency-apartment\"><strong>What is an Efficiency Apartment?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An efficiency apartment is a small apartment, usually between 300-500 square feet. The amenities are contained in a single room, where you can eat, sleep, cook, and clink beers with your friends. Generally, these apartments are well-suited for single folks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" data-attachment-id=\"18923\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment\/attachment\/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"what-is-an-efficiency-apartment\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?resize=800%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"what-is-an-efficiency-apartment\" class=\"wp-image-18923\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"differences-between-efficiency-apartment-and-studio-apartment\"><strong>Differences Between Efficiency Apartment and Studio Apartment<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common questions asked by new renters is, &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between a studio apartment and an efficiency apartment?&#8221; Both types of apartments are small living spaces with more or less the same structure.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/FcuiZUneg1YRAu1lH2\" title=\"headache\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>But even though both the spaces are contained in one room, they have these key differences:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-kitchen\"><strong>1. Kitchen<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While both studio apartments and efficiency apartments have a main living area, their layouts are different. Studios have a full-sized kitchen in the main space, plus a bathroom in a separate room. On the other hand, efficiency apartments have a kitchenette (a smaller version of a kitchen). So, if you&#8217;re a born chef who likes to knock around in the kitchen, you might be better off in a studio!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-location\">2. <strong>Location<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you going to be renting an apartment in a highly desirable part of the city, then you should choose an efficiency apartment. Often, these apartments are closer to centralized locations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-size\"><strong>3. Size<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When we compare the size of efficiency apartments and studios, efficiency apartments are usually smaller. Both are under 500 square feet, but efficiency apartments can be as small as 300 square feet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are planning on renting an apartment with a roommate or a partner, then neither of these apartments are suitable for you. Both efficiency apartments and studio apartments are small living spaces, and living with an extra person can make the space feel even more cramped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-cost\"><strong>4. Cost<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Less space usually means an apartment will cost less. But this is not true in the case of efficiency apartments. They tend to be located in upscale urban areas, whereas studio apartments are located in more rundown part of town. Thus, efficiency apartments are generally more expensive to rent than studio apartments.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:94%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/UQPGnodFG2YZ7OmGHI\" title=\"cost\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pros-and-cons-of-living-in-an-efficiency-apartment\"><strong>Pros And Cons Of Living In An Efficiency Apartment<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pros\">Pros<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, now that you are acquainted with both kinds of spaces, we&#8217;d like to draw your attention to the benefits of living in an efficiency apartment. There are lots of benefits to living in an efficiency apartment, don&#8217;t let the small space make you think otherwise. Take a look at just a couple of them here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>It saves you money, so that you can invest a little more in your future.<\/li><li>Cleaning your apartment is so much easier.<\/li><li>You have access to multifamily apartment amenities like a swimming pool, gym, community clubhouse, etc. So, there&#8217;s no chance of missing out on any kind of fun!<\/li><li>Easy access to the city&#8217;s hustle and bustle &#8211; and proximity to your favourite places, of course!<\/li><li>Utilities will cost you less.
