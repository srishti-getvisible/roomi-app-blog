It\u2019s totally up to the landlord if they are open to this or not. But think about it from their position. Their biggest concern when renting a room in NYC is that the tenant won\u2019t be able to pay. When you pre-pay, you are solving their biggest problem. On-time rent. That should be worth something, right? It can\u2019t hurt to bring it up, and at worse, you just advertised you\u2019ve got quite a bit of savings, thus increasing your chances of being approved for the lease.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:67%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/XdUMiySExIdwvsPOpP\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/XdUMiySExIdwvsPOpP\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Timing Is Everything: When To Find An Affordable Room In NYC<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apartment prices are like any other good or service. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/rent-report\/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-november-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Price<\/a> is set by supply and demand. NYC has more people moving in than it has apartments available most of the time, so prices tend to be pretty stable. But is there a time of year when demand tips ever so slightly in your favor?<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yup. Winter. In general, people hunker down for the winter months, nesting in their caves with popcorn, hot chocolate, and a backlist of movies to watch. If you can afford to wait, you can find slightly better prices in the winter when people are less likely to move in. But keep in mind, folks are also less likely to move out, so while you may have better prices, choices won\u2019t be as plentiful. And you are moving in adverse conditions, so have a plan and keep it safe.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/your-guide-for-shared-apartment-in-nyc\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Your Guide For Shared Apartment In NYC<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Apartment layout<\/b> will affect how affordable the room is in NYC<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The location and layout of an apartment directly impacts its price. When you see an advertisement for a floor plan, it\u2019s not always representative of everything that\u2019s available. There is always one or two apartments that just don\u2019t quite fit into the complex. Like that skinny parking spot they didn\u2019t quite have enough room for because the mall got in the way. Apartments on the ground floor are less expensive than the ones on the top floor. Being in the middle is typically less than being in a corner because middle rooms share more walls. Ask a prospective landlord about apartments with smaller floor plans in cost-effective locations to see what\u2019s available.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:55%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l378weOshiVMMaI9O\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l378weOshiVMMaI9O\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Learn Average Neighborhood Prices With Roomiapp.com<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roomiapp.com makes it easy to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/local\/New+York+City\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">find an affordable room in NYC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
