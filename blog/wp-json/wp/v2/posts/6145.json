with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once that&#8217;s out of the way, you&#8217;d definitely want to see that the person you&#8217;re renting an apartment room to, or are moving in with has a similar lifestyle and habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s simple \u2014 if you&#8217;re a morning person, it just isn&#8217;t a good idea to move in with a night owl.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same way, shared
