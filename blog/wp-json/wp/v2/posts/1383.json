How outgoing are you? Are you willing to share your stuff? What is the balance you&#8217;d want to keep between partying and studying? What kind of relationship do you want with your roommate?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s essential to keep these things in mind because you will encounter people with several different types of personalities throughout life. Different characters and values can often be the source of conflict in interpersonal relationships. If you look forward to establishing a lifelong friendship but are greeted with your roommate&#8217;s cold shoulder, problems could arise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cleanliness should mean the same thing to you and the person that you choose as your roommate.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"8110\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/top-5-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-roommate\/attachment\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"two roommates sitting on their orange couch applying face masks together\" class=\"wp-image-8110\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1320&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-on-a-couch-together-applying-face-masks-scaled.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you need to discuss is cleanliness. This is important because you want your potential roommates to have the same basic cleaning habits as you. No one wants to wake up in the middle of the night, searching for the faint smell of rotten potatoes that interrupt your sleep, only to find out it&#8217;s coming from the body of the person you share a room with, yuck! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s often so that two people living together find out over time that cleanliness as a concept is different for the two of them. One might be an overachiever when it comes to cleaning. And the other, a sucker for the bare minimum. In times like such, we recommend having a talk with your roommate. Or even drawing up a roommate agreement! Those come in super handy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Habits should also align when choosing a roommate. <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"8112\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/top-5-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-roommate\/attachment\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"four roommates sitting against a white window where two people are reading and one woman is overlooking her friend's shoulder into a diary\" class=\"wp-image-8112\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1320&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommates-sitting-together-on-a-dining-table-reading-and-chilling-scaled.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A person&#8217;s habits are another thing you need to consider when choosing a roommate.

However, experienced adults will tell you, when it comes to living with someone new, it&#8217;s time to stop being polite and start getting real. It is important to discuss these issues with potential roommates. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is definitely one of the things to consider when choosing a roommate. You want your roommates to be open and accepting of your beliefs, even if they don&#8217;t align with theirs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Your first experience living with new people can be challenging but fun.<\/a> Because who else, if not for our roommates, would go with us for fast food runs in the middle of the night?
