Especially when money is involved. The least you can do to be safe is find a trustworthy roommate by vetting candidates on platforms that let you find <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">compatible roommates<\/a> for free. But what about landlords? When paying rent, you want to make sure the person you\u2019re&nbsp;doing business with is trustworthy as well. That\u2019s why it\u2019s your right as a tenant to request a rent&nbsp;payment receipt from your landlord to prove you\u2019ve paid your rent. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rent Receipt EXPLAINED\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/l6WrUZQm0lA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, it\u2019s mandatory they give you one.&nbsp;Even if your landlord is a reputable businessperson, it\u2019s simply good sense to have a record of your financial transactions. Just like with anything else you pay for. Luckily online payments and credit cards have made record-keeping a lot easier. However, if you pay rent with cash or personal check, you\u2019ll need to make sure your landlord provides you with a rent payment receipt. No matter how you pay, here are three reasons why you should always get a rent receipt from your landlord.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-importance-of-a-rent-receipt\">The importance of a rent receipt<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/imsojonathan-receipts-receipt-jonathan-fernandez-ggWYLOPV2Q6PSUvIq3\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-to-protect-yourself-against-nbsp-bad-landlords\">1. To Protect Yourself Against&nbsp;Bad Landlords<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We know there are plenty of&nbsp;great landlords out there, but occasionally you\u2019ll come across a bad apple. And more problematically,&nbsp;you might not find this out until it\u2019s too late. It&#8217;s important to request a rent payment receipt from the beginning of your relationship with a new landlord. This not only lets them know you have good business sense, but it also protects you from wrongful accusations of late or unpaid rent. Moreover, it would ultimately save a lot of money, should the issue escalate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/safe-online-banking-tips-for-the-beginner\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Safe Online Banking Tips for the Beginner<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI had a client who paid rent in cash every month&nbsp;and didn\u2019t get a rent receipt,\u201d says Las Vegas-based attorney <a href=\"http:\/\/www.loving.lawyer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">Shaolaine Loving<\/a>. \u201cThe landlord later claimed the tenant didn\u2019t pay for two months from the&nbsp;prior year and assessed late fees on those payments.

So if your landlord decides to evict you for not paying rent (even though&nbsp;you did), and you could have proven otherwise with rent receipts (but you don\u2019t have them). This can reflect badly on your rent history. And in cities with intense housing competition like New York and San Francisco, a shady rent history can ultimately cost you an apartment even if it\u2019s not your fault.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, some states offer a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tax.ny.gov\/pit\/credits\/real_property_tax_credit.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">renters\u2019 tax credit<\/a>\u201d if you meet certain qualifications. And with other reasons notwithstanding, a rent history paper trail is essential when filing taxes, especially when using tax accounting software to track and manage deductions. Again, if you have no written proof that you paid for something, you could lose out on getting some money back because of a technicality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-because-it-s-nbsp-better-to-be-safe-than-sorry\">3. Because It\u2019s&nbsp;Better to Be Safe Than Sorry<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is that you never know when a rent payment receipt will come in handy. Even if your landlord seems trustworthy, there\u2019s no harm in requesting a rent receipt. As it could be your saving grace in a sticky situation. If you can, pay your rent with a credit or debit card, so it shows up on your monthly statement. If your landlord offers a way to pay online, do this \u2014 but only if you can get an email rent receipt. Save these emails or print them out (or both). This way you\u2019d be prepared if you need to give proof you paying rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Money orders are another option, as they inherently have a receipt attached. Make sure to fill the money order out completely, and take a picture. And if cash or check is your only option, ask for that receipt!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-hear-it-from-people-who-ve-been-cheated\">Hear it from people who&#8217;ve been cheated<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cAlways demand a rent receipt when you pay,\u201d Blanton recommends. \u201cDon\u2019t let the manager tell you they\u2019ll get it for you later. If they won\u2019t give you a receipt when you pay, don\u2019t pay until they can. This is how I got burned the first time\u2026they promised to drop it off and never did\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Loving&nbsp;backs this up by saying certain state laws allow&nbsp;tenants to legally refuse rent payment until a receipt is produced. So, know your rights, and educate yourself on the local renters\u2019 protections. (Here is what <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ccsroc.net\/?page_id=467\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SF law<\/a> and NYC law say about rent receipts.) <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/roommate-late-paying-rent\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>What To Do When Your Roommate is Paying Rent Late<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/foxtv-fox-almost-family-almostfamily-Q6yeftAR1dBEGm3OXe\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The same goes if only one roommate is responsible for paying the landlord.
