It isn&#8217;t easy to live in shared apartments, coliving setting, or with roommates. We all have different temperaments, preferences, and stressors. Additionally, in shared apartments, you will come across people from different traditions &amp; cultures. Hence, it is easy to find yourself amidst conflicts in a coliving setting. Even something as frustrating as your nosy roommate babbling behind your back. So how can you remedy this before it turns into a toxic relationship? Let&#8217;s look at some common reasons why your roommate can&#8217;t stop gossiping about you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-resolve-conflicts-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong> How to Resolve Conflicts When You Share an Apartment<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1.

While Ron never said *hit behind Harry&#8217;s back, your roomi has no qualms about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Team Roomi suggests:<\/strong>&nbsp;Your coliving bud&#8217;s jealousy can be a by-product of your talent\/success at work or relationships. It happens to the best of us, and anything can trigger this. Don&#8217;t react! Evaluate their comments first, and try to understand what it is that&#8217;s making them jealous.&nbsp;<a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Deal-With-a-Jealous-Friend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here&#8217;s a guide to help you confront your roommate.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.

They suck you dry and can turn any good bond into a toxic relationship. Coliving with a negative person is exhausting! And needless to say, their paranoia is driving them to talk about you behind your back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Team Roomi suggests:<\/strong>&nbsp;A negative person needs reprogramming to change their outlook towards life.
