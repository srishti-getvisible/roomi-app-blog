However, Roomi offers so much more to make your stay in a new city pleasant, rewarding and refreshingly <em>easy<\/em>! <strong>In this section, we&#8217;ll also answers some common questions you may have. For example, is Badi legit? What makes Roomi the best Badi alternative?

Badi also offers the same service. In the search for your perfect room, we at Roomi know that the best room finder platform must be cost-effective right from the get-go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pet-friendly-apartments\">Pet-Friendly Apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Badi and Roomi both offer pet-friendly listings. <strong>However, the best Badi alternative, Roomi, has additional filters for you to be safe in the knowledge that you will not have to leave your best friend behind!<\/strong> Badi allows the filter option of &#8220;Pet-Friendly&#8221;, but the kinds of pets are not detailed. So, if you have a pet other than a dog or a cat, you may need to contact the Badi support team for further assistance. On the other hand, <strong>Roomi features three filters for pets:<\/strong> &#8220;<strong>&#8220;Dogs OK&#8221;, &#8220;Cats OK&#8221;, &#8220;Other Pets OK&#8221;.<\/strong> That means Izzy Iguana and Harry Hamster can join you on your new adventure, too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/pet-fee-cost-of-pet-friendly-apartments\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pet Fees: The Detailed Costs Of Moving In With Your Furry Best Friend<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subletting\">Subletting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Subletting is often tricky because the subtenant signs an agreement with you rather than the landlord. Essentially, you&#8217;re renting out a part of your rental to another person, while renting the unit from your landlord. Sounds confusing? Don&#8217;t worry, Roomi has simplified the process for you. <strong>However, Badi does not offer subletting services.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities\">Filtering Rooms Based on Amenities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Does you dream room have a private bathroom? Does it have free Wifi? With Roomi, you get a checklist of amenities that allow you to select all the filters that will make your stay in a rental just right. Badi also offers the option to filter rooms based on amenities such as on-site parking and pools. Nonetheless, you will find that the best Badi alternative, Roomi, offers many more filters including but not limited to &#8211; power backup, 24 hour power supply, and security guards.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/0PyaP7rGlVuuz5vew0\" title=\"free wifi\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms\">Filtering Rooms Based on Listing Type (Entire Place\/Shared Rooms)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One size doesn&#8217;t fit all, and this is certainly true when you&#8217;re on a mission to find rooms for rent. For some renters, an entire place is more suitable for privacy or if they&#8217;re moving in with family. For others, saving money by sharing a room is more important. <strong>The #1 Badi alternative<\/strong> <strong>Roomi, helps you find rooms for rent by filtering rooms based on three types of listings:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Entire Place<\/li><li>Private Room<\/li><li>Shared Room<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Badi also offers the same filter options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules\">Filtering Rooms Based on House Rules<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re renting an entire place or a shared room, remember that you&#8217;ll be on someone else&#8217;s turf. This means that there may be a few house rules already in place before you move in. So, how do you find rooms for rent that align with your values and preferences? Roomi has made this process simple and fun &#8211; just check all the house rules that you would prefer. If you don&#8217;t smoke, choose the &#8220;No Smoking&#8221; filter. If you are a couple moving into the rental, choose &#8220;Couples OK&#8221;. Badi offers filters based on house rules as well. <strong>However, you&#8217;ll soon realize that the best Badi alternative, Roomi, has more filters to help you match with the perfect room!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:61%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/broWxG2a4h0VW\" title=\"no smoking\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/moving-in-together-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Moving In Together?

When you&#8217;re planning your finances, the last thing you want to do is break your bank by exceeding your budget to find rooms for rent. <strong>Below, let&#8217;s take a look at how this great Badi alternative, Roomi, is the answer to all your room finder woes:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Free Members:<\/strong> On Roomi, it is free to sign up and list a place to rent. On Badi, only your first match is free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Paid Subscription:<\/strong> Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription is available at $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week. You can choose whether to pay monthly or weekly. Badi Plus is available for $23 per month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at what features are unlocked with Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription vs Badi Plus.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/14SAx6S02Io1ThOlOY\" title=\"money\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"allowing-free-listings\">Allowing Free Listings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On Roomi, you can post an advertisement for free. The first two listings on the platform are free to send out in any of the locations supported by Roomi. Likewise, it is free to search for rentals. However, if users want better results, paying for a Gold subscription plan is recommended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription plan, these are the features you will have access to <em>vis a vis<\/em> listings:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings<\/li><li>5 active listings to post all the empty rooms in your apartment<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meanwhile, with Badi Plus you only get:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>1 free Boost that lasts upto 12 hours.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The major disadvantage is that Badi Plus only boosts 1 listing and not your profile. This means that you will have to activate Badi Plus for every single listing, which means more money out of your bank account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-app-messaging\">In-App Messaging<\/h3>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/sPKiC3U9bsPuMzi6qQ\" title=\"message\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>In order to find rooms for rent, you need to be able to contact as many people as possible. Roomi provides the tools you need to do this. You can send and view messages for free on Roomi. Furthermore, the best room finder&#8217;s free plan also allows you to ask questions and set up times to view apartments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nevertheless, if you&#8217;re looking to unlock more features with regards to in-app messaging, with Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription you have:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Access to unlimited messages with potential roomies. (On mobile, you also get unlimited swipes!)<\/li><li>A Fully Verified status upgrade which gets you 5x more messages.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Badi Plus allows you to chat with as many profiles as you want and directly contact the profiles who have viewed your listings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>However, your Badi Plus plan has to be renewed manually each month otherwise it expires automatically.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible\">Security: How Do These Apps Ensure That the Listings are Credible?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Badi uses a process called the &#8220;Lister Score&#8221; which increases as users verify their personal details, bank details, respond to messages quickly, and so on. <strong>The #1 Badi alternative, Roomi is committed to your physical safety and protection of your data. Roomi safeguards you and your information in the following ways:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>ID Verification:<\/strong> Verifying your Listers account when you&#8217;re trying to find rooms for rent is a useful way to ensure that you don\u2019t end up renting from someone who isn\u2019t genuine. The verification process involves providing a copy of your lease, utility bill, or government-issued ID. Roomi also allows you to see badges on a user&#8217;s listing to check what kinds of verification they have provided.<\/li><li><strong>Location:<\/strong> While you can share your Roomi listing address, the exact location isn&#8217;t visible to others on the app. Instead, only an approximate location is shown.<\/li><li><strong>Content Moderation:<\/strong> If a user violates community standards, Roomi\u2019s content moderation team will review the listing. If necessary, they will remove the listing from the app.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finally, you can also request the Roomi support team to <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.freshdesk.com\/en\/support\/solutions\/articles\/44000214959-how-can-i-delete-my-data-under-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">delete your data by filling a form<\/a> under the GDPR rules.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you\">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When moving into a new place, you want to know you&#8217;ll feel comfortable and safe in your new surroundings.
