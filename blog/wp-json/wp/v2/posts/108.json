So what happens when you find the perfect roommate who also happens to <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/why-co-living-is-a-rising-trend-among-single-parents\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">have a child<\/a>? It\u2019s not exactly like living with an <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/how-to-deal-with-your-roommates-untrained-pet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">untrained pet<\/a>&nbsp;(though you might want to prepare yourself for the occasional accident), but living with a minor can be intimidating \u2014 even if you have experience with kids. Then again, it can also be pretty fun having a playmate around. With clear communication and some ground rules, you can totally make it work for everyone! Here are a few tips from experts and roommates alike on how best to take on co-living with kids.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Reality of Co-Living With Kids<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" alt=\"two toddler playing letter cubes with their mom co-living with kids\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, you should talk with the parent(s) about their expectations for the living arrangement and your inevitable interactions with the kid(s). You might be used to staying up late and walking around in a towel post-shower, but these habits may not fly anymore with the little ones around. Early childhood and <a href=\"http:\/\/beliefinparenting.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">parenting expert<\/a> Barbara Harvey offers advice on a few things you should consider before signing a lease with someone who has kids.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Remember: This is a Child\u2019s Home<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Living with a child is like living with someone whose lifestyle is completely different than yours: You\u2019ll sleep, eat, and play on opposite schedules. Not to mention, you have to consider the reality of growing pains. Think you know what tantrums are? You have no idea until you\u2019ve lived with a kid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cChildren are sometimes loud,&nbsp; cranky, whiny, overexcited, and rude. Are you willing to deal with those times?\u201d asks Harvey.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love to come home and unwind, you should know it\u2019s not always going to be easy, adds Alex Davis, a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/roomiapp.com\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">live-in nanny<\/a> from Washington state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cChildren are unpredictable. You never know if you\u2019re walking into a total disaster or a happy home. If you think you are going to come home and relax, you are clearly mistaken.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Reality of Co Living with Kids\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JLi397JbWkM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Discuss Your Boundaries<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Living with a parent does not in any way mean you\u2019re signing up to be a secondary caretaker, but this should be made crystal clear. Are you willing to help with some babysitting, or do you want zero responsibility? The decision is yours to make, but both parties should be in agreement, advises Harvey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cClarify the relationship that will exist between you and the kids and whether you\u2019re expected to assist in childcare in any way,\u201d she says. \u201cSet clear rules about whether children are allowed in your space when you\u2019re home and when you\u2019re not.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying nothing at all in the beginning could mean having to hold your tongue later to maintain the peace. Although it can be an awkward topic, the importance of personal space is something 26-year-old Ashley Wade wishes she had brought up before moving in with her sister and nephew over a year ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cI essentially moved into their established home. So my space feels somewhat limited. I don\u2019t have a section of kitchen cabinets that\u2019s mine or extra storage space. And pretty much the only \u201cme\u201d time I get away from the noise and the occasional bickering between mother and son is when I\u2019m in my small room,\u201d she confesses.<\/p><p>\u201cNapping is a chore and getting woken up early on my off days just comes with the territory.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re all about hanging with the kids, then great! But make sure you also understand where&nbsp;<em>your<\/em> boundaries lie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cTalk about if you can bring friends over, if you can have someone spend the night, and if you\u2019re allowed to take the kids out and about around town,\u201d suggests Davis. \u201cThere are lots of things to find out, so realize you might not think of everything at the beginning. Once you get to know the family, it will all come out.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Be&nbsp;Yourself\u2026Respectfully<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Living with a child also means realizing that you are setting an example \u2014 whether you like it or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cBy moving into a house with children, you automatically become an adult role model. Even if you\u2019re rarely around, children are keen observers,\u201d says Harvey.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That means everything from your recreational habits to your overnight guests will be on full display. So while you may not be a babysitter, being a positive influence in passing is important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cI have to be mindful of who I bring around. Little eyes see everything, and it\u2019s very different than just living with adults, \u201d says Wade.<\/p><p>\u201cOut of respect, I always let my sister know who may be coming by and if I\u2019ll be home late. I do feel like it\u2019s both our home, but I feel more like the guest. It\u2019s not bad; it\u2019s just not as much freedom as it would be if you were sharing a home with your peers.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Perks of Co-Living With Kids<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\u2019ve covered the dos and don\u2019ts, but it\u2019s not all so serious. Living with kids can be a blast, says Davis, who loves working and living with children because of their ability to brighten her day instantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cA pro to living with children is that they can take your mind off anything, even if you are having a terrible day. Also, kids are active. There isn\u2019t much time for boredom or wasting the day away.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>An added bonus: You\u2019ll never be&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/co-living-101-making-nice-with-the-bad-neighbors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\"><em>those<\/em> neighbors<\/a>, as everyone will have quiet hours \u2014 and that\u2019s a plus for you too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about them coming home drunk at 4 a.m.,\u201d points out&nbsp;Davis.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Touch\u00e9.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers manage co-living with kids?
