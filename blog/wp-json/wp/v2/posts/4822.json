Scented candles, a wreath, and fall vegetables such as Pumpkins are all great ways to make your apartment look more thanksgiving ready. A super simple (and affordable!) way of making your dining table look fancy is to use the seasonal veggies as centrepieces too. You can even find the candles and a tablecloth from your local thrift store or Goodwill!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust us, going out to buy a few budget-friendly things for thanksgiving with your roommates will make the day feel special and get you into the festive mood. Whether you go all out with decor or choose to DIY, there&#8217;s no holiday season without fun and festive decorations!

So, this is the one area where you cannot fall behind! But let\u2019s face it, most college students don\u2019t have the equipment, skill, time or money to make an elaborate Thanksgiving meal. So, get together with your roommates and decide on a simple menu for Thanksgiving. If you don\u2019t feel like doing much cooking at all, it\u2019s completely fine to order some Chinese food or get meals from the supermarket &#8211; treat yourself however you&#8217;d like!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit of celebrating with your roomis is that you don\u2019t have to make things you don\u2019t like eating. Don\u2019t like mashed potatoes? Switch it up with roast potatoes instead. Don\u2019t like turkey? Get chicken roast instead. Don\u2019t like pumpkin pie? Make whatever dessert you want! The point is that you get to decide what you want to eat, so make the most of it! You could also invite your friends (if it&#8217;s safe) and turn dinner into a pot-luck meal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don\u2019t forget, it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t need to have fancy cutlery sets or matching table mats! The charm of Friendsgiving is that it&#8217;s chill and laid back, so enjoy it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"9789\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/tips-for-hosting-thanksgiving-with-roommates-roomi\/attachment\/thanksgiving-dinner\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/thanksgiving-dinner.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"thanksgiving-dinner\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/thanksgiving-dinner.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/thanksgiving-dinner.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/thanksgiving-dinner.jpg?resize=610%2C406&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"People eating Thanksgiving dinner\" class=\"wp-image-9789\" width=\"610\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/thanksgiving-dinner.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/thanksgiving-dinner.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/thanksgiving-dinner.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Table Settings<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When planning your table setting for thanksgiving with your roommates, it\u2019s best to keep things minimal and basic. It\u2019s completely fine to use disposable plates, napkins, cups and cutlery- it\u2019s way easier to clean up and adds to the charm of a college Friendsgiving. If you don\u2019t have a dining space or if it\u2019s too small, you could even make a little picnic spot on the floor where everyone can sit and eat. After all, pillows and blankets and your favourite PJ&#8217;s make for a very cozy atmosphere! A formal dinner might feel out-of-place if you\u2019re celebrating with your friends, so ditch the (proverbial) high heels and get comfy!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:83%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/hs0If3hDc1zVhwimMP\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/hs0If3hDc1zVhwimMP\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Entertainment<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No party is complete without entertainment. So, think of some party games that you can play before and after dinner. Whether you play cards, drinking games or good old monopoly, the choices are endless! But be sure to create a playlist for the party so that you can have awesome music playing throughout the night and keep spirits high! Take this time to bond with your roomis, you probably won\u2019t get to spend time with them like this again. That&#8217;s what celebrating thanksgiving with your roommates is all about!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, you need to throw caution to the wind and do what feels good to you and your roomis. Who knows, maybe this Thanksgiving break will be the beginning of a new tradition!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/da1QMxGXSSmmY5oGLS\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/da1QMxGXSSmmY5oGLS\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers host Thanksgiving with their roommates?
