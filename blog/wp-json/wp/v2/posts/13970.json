As if work stress wasn\u2019t enough, now you have to find time to complete your roommate\u2019s chores as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you may wish to avoid confrontation, in some cases, it&#8217;s unavoidable. So, what would be the best way to ask your roommate to start cleaning up after themselves?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Looking for a roommate? Here are some qualities to look for!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Communicate your distress<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When living with a messy roommate, it&#8217;s easy to assume they\u2019re just lazy. However, it&#8217;s best to give them a chance to explain themselves and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinkvilla.com\/lifestyle\/people\/got-messy-roommate-here-s-how-confront-them-528808\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\">have a conversation about it<\/a>. When living with another person, communication is key. There may be several reasons why your roommate can&#8217;t clean up after themselves; perhaps, they just lost their job or dealing with a difficult work situation, or it\u2019s just how they are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way of dealing with a messy roommate is to communicate your distress. Instead of hurling accusations at them, try to frame the problem as something that you need to tackle together. Pointing out your roommate\u2019s flaws may be tempting, but it will only make them defensive and unwilling to listen to your suggestions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Pick your battles<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having honest conversations is important, but it&#8217;s just as crucial to know when to pick your battles. Arguing over every dirty dish, or crumb on the floor isn&#8217;t going to be productive. Cribbing over minor issues will probably lead to your roommate not wanting to listen to you, even when things are their fault.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your roommate\u2019s laziness is affecting common living spaces, that\u2019s when you should try to convey your unhappiness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Think of your apartment in zones<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When dealing with a messy roommate, you need to accept that your home won&#8217;t be as neat and perfect as you want it to be. If you want everything to be your way, you\u2019re likely to be disappointed. The best way to approach living with a lazy roommate is to think of your apartment in three zones: your space, your roommate\u2019s space, and common spaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have complete control over your space, such as your bedroom, and can keep it as tidy as you like. Similarly, your roommate has the right to keep their roommate the way they like it, although it may not be up to your standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Create a chore list or chart<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although you may assume that your roommate understands their chores without needing to verbalize them, you may be wrong. Creating a chore list or chart helps keep track of what you both need to get done. It also helps that you have a visual reminder of the tasks that you need to do around the house to avoid forgetting or leaving it for the next day.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"21014\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-deal-with-a-messy-roommate\/attachment\/create-a-chore-list-or-chart\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?fit=2670%2C1780&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2670,1780\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Create a chore list or chart\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Create a chore list or chart\" class=\"wp-image-21014\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?resize=1250%2C834&amp;ssl=1 1250w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1 900w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Create-a-chore-list-or-chart.png?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/person-washing-fork-hQOHDAibf6A\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sit down with your roommate and try to split the chores according to what you like and what they like. For example, you can wash the dishes then your roommate will wipe them and put them back on the shelf. As much as possible, try to divide chores evenly; you don\u2019t want to get stuck doing all the work yourself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/sharing-a-kitchen-a-guide-to-peacefully-share-a-kitchen-with-roommates\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sharing a Kitchen: A Guide to Peacefully Share a Kitchen with Roommates<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Try cleaning and organizing together<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If all else fails, why not suggest cleaning and organizing together? Perhaps your roommate prefers group activities or could do with some tips on how to organize themselves better. Cleaning together can be a great way to spend time with your roommates and bond with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Lead by example<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see that your roommate tends to leave a mess in the apartment, try leading by example. Clean up after yourself when eating or after using the kitchen or living room, show your roommate what should be done when it comes to cleaning. This way, your roommate can see how you clean and maybe take it as a sign that they should start cleaning too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.
