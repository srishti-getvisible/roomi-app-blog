With people from all backgrounds and walks of life coming together, there are many types of college roommates you will meet. Whether it is your dorm roommate or flatmates, be prepared to meet some interesting people! Here is a guide to the common types of roommates you will meet and how to deal with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate\/\">Looking for a roommate? Here are some qualities to look for!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Types of roommates in college<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. The introverts:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l3V0dbWcERDPRglkA\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l3V0dbWcERDPRglkA\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>They are the quiet ones who like to go about their lives without interrupting yours and can seem quite enigmatic. Having a small and close friend circle, they need time to warm up to people before opening up to them. If your flat or dorm roommate falls into this type, you will need to respect their space and privacy. Make an effort to understand them better and talk to them, but do not be pushy or put them in awkward situations! Introverts can be great friends once you get to know them better.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/kDND93uMTfsMOvvmqx\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/kDND93uMTfsMOvvmqx\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.

They love chatting and opening up while getting to know new people. Everyone loves them and they bring fun and cheer to any conversation or gathering. These people can always be seen with a crowd around them and seem to have an aura that attracts everyone to them.

They are always on time for classes and can be found in the library reading up in their free time. Often stereotyped for being nerdy, they are actually very hardworking and determined to succeed. They are great friends to have around and will remind you to study for that test, and keep you focused on your academics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/faq\/how-do-i-browse-people-roommates-on-roomi\/\">How do I browse people (roommates) on Roomi?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.
