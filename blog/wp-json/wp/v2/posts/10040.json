It&#8217;s 2021, and while some things have resumed, we still are combatting the Covid-19 virus globally. Recovery of all forms is important, global and individual. And one of the easiest ways of allowing yourself to recover is by practicing gratitude. How does practicing gratitude during a pandemic help? It allows you to see those sides of your days that you may have otherwise forgotten to appreciate. This allows you to be more mindful of the blessings in your life, and more cognizant of the things you have accomplished. It&#8217;s honestly quite simple, you don&#8217;t have to spend money to be happy. Finding alternatives is the healthier way we all need, now more than ever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But what does recovering from a pandemic really entail?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Recovery from this year wouldn&#8217;t just mean the introduction and availability of a vaccine, it would also mean policy changes, guided transitions into a pandemic-less world that is created in conjunction with medical experts, scientists, and economists alike. But recovery from this year would also need to mean individual recovery. It becomes generally difficult to gauge the weight on the shoulders of an individual. Especially for a young one, trying to make ends meet, provide for themselves and their family, and navigate a pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re not promising that the following will fix everything. But they might make your every day a little better. So maybe, give it a shot and see if some of them help you make a difference to your days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are 10 things that can possibly make your days better, pandemic or not.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:53%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l0HFjs5duuNEBCQwg\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l0HFjs5duuNEBCQwg\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notice and get excited about the little things.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You really don&#8217;t have to travel to act like a tourist. Wild, don&#8217;t you think? Act like a tourist with the little things around you and let their normalcy exhilarate you. Also, do yourself a favor and take the negative connotation out of the word &#8220;normal&#8221;. your normal has its own beauty, keep telling yourself that. Gratitude for the little things is the shortest ride to happier days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be easier on yourself.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a golden rule of thumb, dont take yourself so seriously!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realize that you\u2019re not the only one on a journey; you are a small part of a much bigger picture. It\u2019s not all on you, and you are not alone. Especially in 2020, everyone\u2019s just trying to FIGURE. IT. OUT. Allowing yourself to be nicer to yourself, pandemic or not, can also open multiple doors towards a gratitude-filled life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related : <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/emerging-fashion-trends-the-pandemic-edition-roomi\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Emerging Fashion Trends: The Pandemic Edition<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be a cheerleader (mostly figuratively)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Watching your friends&#8217; success can be one of the ebst feelings in the world. So be their hype man. Push them, root for them and be there when need a little pick me up. Being a part of someone else&#8217;s happiness can help add to yours. And gives you yet another reason to feel gratitude in your days.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/H3ePnEMGAZdB4wJrXI\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/H3ePnEMGAZdB4wJrXI\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be as present as you can.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, this was all over the internet this year and the last and you might call it a clich\u00e9 but, being present means allowing yourself to not waste your time over things that don&#8217;t matter. And your time is the most important thing. Be in the here and in the now and don&#8217;t spend too long thinking about the fact that your boss can sometimes forget everything we&#8217;re dealing with collectively as the human race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take some risks and then some more.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazing things can happen outside of your comfort zone. Everything in life is either a lesson or a blessing. What might feel like a mistake, is just proof that you tried! It\u2019s your one life to live, so make it a great story. You don\u2019t want to look back on your life with a tally of things you wish you had done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marie Kondo your mind<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No we don&#8217;t mean forget everything unwanted but that is also kind of what we mean. There&#8217;s a million things to keep up with everyday. But if we all got rid of the clutter in our heads, can you imagine what the world would look like? Starting each day with a clean slate is as important as making sure you&#8217;re out of the house catching some fresh air at least for 1\/24 hours in your day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let yourself look forward to things<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s your cat\u2019s birthday tomorrow or a vacation in 6 months, have something to prep for and get excited about! Having something on your agenda to look forward to makes every day a little more compelling. Even if it&#8217;s a very materialistic thing, keep yourself engaged. This becomes a very important aspect in maintaining a sense of normalcy. Especially in times when we&#8217;re dealing with a global crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic, gratitude can and must be practiced in the smallest of things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do. Not. Give. Discounts. On. Your. Worth.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing your worth and value are key in getting to know yourself and being nicer to yourself. Practice self-love, know your value, and never settle for less. Know when to leave the table if respect is no longer being served. You are the only you, and you need to be taken care of, a one-of-a-kind piece.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/EXRlr0PBsI7QUH1vHv\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/EXRlr0PBsI7QUH1vHv\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Open thy mind<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The world turned upside down in a lot of respects in 2020. There was immense pain and the a gaping need for healing. There has truly been no better time to move past shades in our mind. don&#8217;t stop yourself from growing, and promise yourself to see and learn something new everyday. That&#8217;s all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let yourself slow down<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, know when to slow down and know when to walk away. Give yourself the gift of a couple extra deep breaths, get in your car for a coffee run and blast your favorite tunes. Squeeze in some time for an extra walk and slow down and enjoy your day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s wishing you a very fruitful 2020 to you, dear reader.
