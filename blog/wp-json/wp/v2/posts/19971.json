If everything goes well, you will get a best friend in disguise and a trustworthy confidant. Having said that, you will also come across many <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi\/\">types of roommates<\/a> in your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may come across a roommate who is an absolute slob- ignoring the messy spaces they create and leaving dishes uncleaned. On the other hand, you may also find someone who is organized like Monica in <em>Friends<\/em>&#8211; who makes their beds every morning and always volunteers to clean the kitchen. While there is no one reason to say which personality can fit your requirements, finding someone with whom you can communicate easily is important. Everyone has some flaws but as long as it doesn\u2019t hamper your lifestyle and your mental health, you can always get along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are clear about what you want from your roommate, you can proceed to find the perfect one in a few simple steps!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-interview-questions-to-ask-your-potential-roommates\">Interview questions to ask your potential roommates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you meet and greet a couple of people in your roommate hunt, a good interview is all about the important questions. It doesn\u2019t have to be as grilling as a job interview\u2014 but having a good roommate can be as important as landing a good job, don\u2019t you agree?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/cheerful-diverse-friends-talking-at-table-with-coffee-in-cafe-6457517\/\" class=\"broken_link\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking the right questions is important so that you are clear about who you are living with. Figure out what is important to you in a living situation and frame your questions accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/potential-roommate-questions-you-should-ask\/\">potential roommate questions<\/a> that you must ask?:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>\u201cWhat is your work? Work from office or home?\u201d<\/strong> This would determine if they would pay their rents on time and how often you\u2019d expect to see them around. If you are interacting with students, you can ask about how they are planning to pay rent\u2014 is there a parent who is providing, or do they work part-time?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>\u201cWhat do your weekends look like?\u201d<\/strong> It may not seem significant, but you should know if they have any hobbies or like inviting friends over. And if they like doing the same things as you, it couldn\u2019t get better.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>\u201cHave you lived with roommates before?\u201d<\/strong> It would be great to know if they have had good co-living experiences and what kind of people they have lived with before. It could be a red flag if they only talk about bad experiences. If they have never lived with roommates before, you could be the first to face some challenges.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>\u201cHow do you feel about cleanliness and household chores?\u201d<\/strong> Sharing an apartment is sharing responsibilities, and cleaning is the top priority. Tell them about your thoughts first and see if they comply.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>\u201cWhat kind of roommate do you want?\u201d<\/strong> Just like you have made a checklist, your roommate candidate must also have one. Ask them what they are looking for to see if you match.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Add more questions as you seem necessary. But be ready with all the answers yourself first. The interview should have them asking you questions as well. And if they don\u2019t ask you anything, that would be <em>fishy<\/em>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/types-of-roommates-in-college\/\">Types of roommates in college<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-finding-a-roommate-within-your-network\">Finding a roommate within your network<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you go on looking for roommates online or on public networks, it\u2019s best to begin from your inner circle. You can turn to family, friends, or co-workers\u2014 find a trustworthy name and reach out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <em>warning bells<\/em>, maintain your guard and don\u2019t get carried away just because you found a familiar name. People can be amazing when you meet them in a cafe or outside to chill, but it&#8217;s an entirely different story when it comes to sharing a space. Therefore, ask your questions and clarify every doubt regarding the living situation. Look out for <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/roommate-red-flags\/\">roommate red flags<\/a> to avoid a horror story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you found a great friend who is also in need of a roommate, be careful. Best friends are generally not your <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/making-perfectish-roommates-a-reality-roomi\/\">soul roommates<\/a>. You must set boundaries from the get-go and be respectful of private space. If that doesn\u2019t happen from the beginning, it can be a disaster!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-find-a-roommate-on-social-media\">How to find a roommate on social media?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t find anyone in your personal network, don\u2019t worry. Social media platforms can be pretty helpful to expand the search. You may meet familiar names through your followers on these channels. But you may also meet new people with similar interests and backgrounds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Facebook<\/strong> is great for roommate hunts where you can reach out to a large number of people through groups as well. Create a strong bio mentioning all the details, and you can meet some interesting people.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Instagram<\/strong> can help you reach out to your followers. Create a newsfeed post or story describing your requirements, and you are good to go. You may also use hashtags for your locality or city.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create a <strong>Twitter<\/strong> post to ask your followers if they need a roommate. Again hashtags can be very useful here.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>LinkedIn<\/strong> is generally more about your professional circle. So, you may get someone from a similar work background to live with you. Make a detailed post about your needs and requirements, and connect.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/woman-in-white-shirt-holding-red-pen-4003763\/\" class=\"broken_link\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also come across other roommate-looking people posting about their needs on social media.

But guess what can be even more important? A <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/4-things-include-roommate-agreement\/\">roommate agreement<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this does not involve your landlord or any third party other than your roommates. Finding a good roommate is one thing, but maintaining a good roommate relationship is an entirely new domain. Before you start worrying about cleaning schedules and establishing rules regarding house guests, there must be a reference point that all parties agree upon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/women-at-the-meeting-3810795\/\" class=\"broken_link\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be times when your roommate vanishes for days without any notice. And what if they forget about paying the rent? Collecting money for utilities can be more tricky than paying rent. A roommate agreement can help you avoid such tricky situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some important things that you must mention in your roommate agreement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Paying rents and bills<\/strong>: Messing up with the finances can lead to a lot of tension between roommates. Determine the list of things you would be sharing apart from rent, like Wi-Fi and groceries. Who will handle the rent payments? Electricity and other bills? Before anything leads to a dispute\u2014 have a meeting and discuss. List out the person responsible for collecting and paying for utilities. Clearly mention the due dates and exact amount to be paid. There are also some amazing apps for <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/3-awesome-apps-splitting-bills-roommates\/\">splitting bills with roommates<\/a> to make the task easier.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Household chores and apartment maintenance<\/strong>: While living with a roommate, cleaning schedules and dividing chores is a must. No one wants to clean up for the mess they didn\u2019t make in the first place. It is best to prepare a chore list and include it in the roommate agreement- add schedules and task ownership.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Entertainment and hosting guests<\/strong>: It could be fun to host parties in your apartment once in a while and invite guests over. There can be visits by friends, family, and partners. However, not everyone in the house will love it every day.

Here are some practices to enjoy your apartment life to the fullest:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Always communicate<\/strong>: Just like any other relationship, communication is key. Living together, you may come across situations when things don\u2019t sit tight with you. Understand that it\u2019s okay to disagree on certain things and move on. However, don\u2019t let the tension build up with the silent treatment. Talk to them politely to fix and resolve such situations. Most roommates can talk out disputes and find solutions, but things can get tricky if you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/5-common-behaviors-passive-aggressive-roommate\/\" class=\"broken_link\">passive aggressive roommate<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spend time together<\/strong>: An important part of living with a roommate is to know more about them. Have a coffee session together or watch a movie together. Spending time together will help you develop a good friendship and trust each other more.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maintain boundaries<\/strong>: Whether it\u2019s sharing food or Wi-Fi, be clear about the boundaries. It is important to give space to your roommate. Even if you live in a small apartment, make some arrangements so that everyone can enjoy some personal space when they need to.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexels.com\/photo\/crop-asian-girlfriends-playing-video-games-at-home-4132411\/\" class=\"broken_link\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/5-tips-find-roommate-youll-love-nyc\/\">Find A Roommate In NYC That You\u2019ll Love!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-find-a-roommate-faqs\">How to find a roommate: FAQs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q. What is the safest way to find a roommate?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin with your network\u2014 connect with familiar people you can trust rather than strangers. Apart from that, there are several apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/roommates\">Roomi<\/a> where you can find background-verified individuals. Talk to them and ask your questions openly to find a person that you can trust and meet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q. Why is finding a roommate hard?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding a roommate can be hard, especially if you are new to a city or a country. New people can be intimidating to talk to as well. It is also challenging to find someone with a compatible personality. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to talk to people openly and decide who is right for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q. What should I mention in my roommate bio?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mention every detail that can make a difference to your new roommate. This would include your apartment location, where you are from, where you are working or studying, and what is your budget. It would also be great to mention your personality traits- if you like to go out a lot or if you like cleaning. Tell them what your regular routine looks like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q. Should I live with a roommate in a new city?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s a great idea to live with a roommate in a new city. Firstly, it can help you save on rent and expenses. Apart from that, it would also help you make a friend easily. And there are plenty of solutions if you are thinking about how to find a roommate in a new city. The best option is to make a profile in online roommate finders like <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roomi<\/a>, where you can connect and chat with background verified people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q. How long does it take to find a roommate?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could take a week or a few months to find a roommate as it would depend on what you are looking for and where. At times, you can compromise with a few traits and get along. But if you take the time to meet many people and reach out to many platforms at once, it should take you about a month to find the best roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-get-the-ideal-roommate-to-share-your-apartment-with-roomi\">Get the ideal roommate to share your apartment with <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\">Roomi<\/a>!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding a good roommate can be tough but with the right connections and online tools, it\u2019s easier than ever before.
