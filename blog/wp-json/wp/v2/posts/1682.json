How do you behave in the presence of people? There might have been times when you labeled yourself as either an introvert or an extrovert. While we all are a yin-yang of both, when it comes to deciding between living alone vs. living with a roommate, these self-observations might play a vital role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re just starting to live on your own, or looking for a change. Both living alone and living with a roommate has lots to offer, depending on what you&#8217;re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re almost convinced that <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/science-roommate-makes-happier\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">living with a roommate will make you happier<\/a>, let this guide reassure you.

This is irrespective of what you prefer. If you&#8217;re at a point in life where you need to save as much as you can, then you probably should be living with a roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, if you don&#8217;t mind paying extra to keep your privacy intact, living alone is for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does living alone sound like &#8220;home&#8221; to you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"8512\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/deciding-between-living-alone-and-with-roommates-roomi\/attachment\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?fit=1707%2C2560&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1707,2560\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"woman living alone is sitting on the ground and playing solitaire on her laptop\" class=\"wp-image-8512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?resize=1365%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1365w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C1800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C2970&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/woman-sitting-by-lapto-living-alone-scaled.jpg?w=1707&amp;ssl=1 1707w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, introverts might get drained by too much social interaction.

And if you are among the former and can be yourself with everyone, kudos to you! You know that living with roommates will come rather easily to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Living with a roommate interferes with the freedom of solitude.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s rightly believed that solitude breeds creativity. If you live alone, there are no distractions. You can meet people in your own time. And you can instantly start working on an idea that strikes without taking heed of someone else in the apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&#8217;re someone with a preference to learn from people and collaborate instead of being on your own, the roommate life awaits you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sharing your space, food and life are the starting points of living with a roommate.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"8514\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/deciding-between-living-alone-and-with-roommates-roomi\/attachment\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"living-with-roommates-sharing-meals\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"women living together as roommates are sitting on a kitchen counter having beer and pizza\" class=\"wp-image-8514\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1320&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-roommates-sharing-meals-scaled.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember hating your sibling for snatching the TV remote and watching shows that you didn&#8217;t like, and their loud music that you simply detested? Well, having a roommate could be a similar, more civil version of having to share everything. And shouting &#8216;MOM&#8217; will not do anything other than making your roommate think you&#8217;re crazy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then again, some of us might have missed out on this relationship and wouldn&#8217;t mind finding out what all the fuss is about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Living alone isn&#8217;t for you if you get scared easily.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This one&#8217;s pretty obvious isn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you are afraid and still want to live alone, make it an opportunity to look your fears in the eyes. In the end, it&#8217;s really about experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re ready to be independent and live all alone, embrace the self-improvement journey you can now embark on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If on the other hand, you can&#8217;t afford to live alone, embrace the experiences and the joys of having a buddy to navigate life with under the same roof.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers differ between the charms of living alone vs. with a roommate?
