It can be from moving out for college, for a new job, or just simply relocating to a new place. Nonetheless, anyone can get anxiety from moving. With all it\u2019s preparations and processes, it\u2019s totally normal for anyone moving out to get moving anxiety. But you don\u2019t have to worry! In this article, we\u2019ll help you navigate around your anxiety from moving and tell you what you can do to reduce the stress that comes along with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/breaking-a-lease-before-moving-in\/\">Breaking a lease before moving in?

It brings a lot of changes in your life that may or may not be the cause of too much emotions, or what we like to call: <strong>moving anxiety.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many people, relocating to a new place can be hard. It can feel like moving out of something you already know, like getting pushed out of your comfort zone. However, one good advice we can give you is to <em>take everything one step at a time<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We understand the struggles and stress of any move, so we\u2019re here to help you out. Before anything else, it\u2019s important to understand why you\u2019re feeling this way and where it comes from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why is there Anxiety from Moving?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might wonder, why is moving so stressful? Well, there\u2019s a lot of factors that can be considered; there\u2019s no one single reason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Major changes in your life can be stressful. You\u2019d have to change your address, arrange all your stuff, manage some paperwork\u2014all-in-all, changes can trigger anxiety from everything happening.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>When moving out, money is an essential. You\u2019d have to save enough money, make down payments, arrange moving vans (which you need to spend on too). Sometimes money, or the lack of, is a big stressor especially when moving.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Packing can also be a reason for your moving anxiety. You\u2019ll have to gather all your belongings, maybe think of selling some of your stuff, then unpack them all again once you get to your new home.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your pets can be a lot to think about when moving too. Plus, you need to think of additional <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/pet-fee-cost-of-pet-friendly-apartments\/\">pet fees<\/a> as well.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The time it takes when moving can be a source of stress, especially when you\u2019re moving to a far place. Since there\u2019s a lot to do, you might not get enough rest, adding more to your moving anxiety.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these reasons may be a matter of small things, but when it\u2019s all piled up, it can get too much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-deal-with-the-anxiety-of-moving-out\">How to Deal with the Anxiety of Moving Out?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/6aY-6B3MiZ4\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When moving gets too much, everything else in your life can be affected as well. But, there are many ways you can ease your moving anxiety. Here are some of them:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Make a list.<\/strong> Staying organized while moving lessens your stress by a whole lot. By making a list, you\u2019re also prioritizing and taking things one step at a time. You get to rest in between items on your list and get a little bit of satisfaction when you check them off. To start, here\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/printable-moving-in-checklist-for-a-new-apartment\/\">moving in checklist<\/a> you can use!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Take your time.<\/strong> Don\u2019t rush into moving to a new place; go at your own pace. Don\u2019t plan everything in a day! Instead, just a lot a chunk of your time in a day for planning and preparing. This way, you\u2019ll be able to cover all the bases when it comes to moving.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rest.<\/strong> In everything you do, it\u2019s vital to rest! Resting and taking time for yourself can help (and maybe even prevent) moving anxiety. By talking a walk, closing your eyes, or just detaching yourself from all the preparations can help reduce any stress.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ask for help.<\/strong> You don\u2019t have to do everything by yourself. When it comes to moving, you would need all the help you can get. Even just the littlest of things like picking up something from the grocery or even lifting a box up can help relieve your stress. There are courier companies that offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reliablecouriers.com\/services\/same-day-delivery\/cargo-van-freight\">same-day freight<\/a>, so with that you cover both the transport of your things and the someone to lift your heavier items.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t forget your self-care.<\/strong> Feeling more tired than usual while moving is normal, but don\u2019t forget to take care of yourself. Get a full eight-hour sleep, don\u2019t skip meals, go on a bubble bath, do whatever makes you feel happy. Maybe even meditate or go on a yoga class, just don\u2019t take yourself for granted while preparing for your move.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel like your moving anxiety is getting too much, there\u2019s nothing wrong with seeking professional help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-you-ll-get-through-it\">You\u2019ll Get Through It!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/DzIt-fTYv4E\">Unsplash<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving out can be pretty stressful, but remember why you\u2019re doing it. It will all be worth it (even the moving anxiety) once you\u2019re in your new apartment, lying down after a busy day. Remind yourself that all the preparations, stress, packing, conversations, and paper works is only temporary. More than that, you don\u2019t have to do all the moving on your own. Remember: don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help and take things one step at a time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, using a trusted and reliable room finder can also lessen your stress on moving.
