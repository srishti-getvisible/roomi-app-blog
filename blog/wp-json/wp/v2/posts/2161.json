Now, moving on!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/5xaOcLSjCuroxKfZ4yI\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/5xaOcLSjCuroxKfZ4yI\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been 6 months since we&#8217;ve been spending time in a work from home situation. And chances are, most of us are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">still trying to find that sweet spot<\/a> of the perfect workspace. And one that intersects optimal productivity and comfort to get your through 8 business hours. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many DIYs to inspire you to re-do your workspace at home. But if you&#8217;re renting a fairly small space, the landlord might not want you overstepping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the great thing about re-doing your workspace at home is that it doesn&#8217;t take a lot of effort (or money.) To create the perfect workspace requires no alteration to the property you are renting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what does it mean to have the perfect workspace? A work space that feels right. And one that helps you avoid distractions the best you can, so you can work the way you like. Basically, the kind that doesn&#8217;t make you want to doze off after reading just 3 emails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are our key pointers that will make all the difference to your work from home days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The desk for your perfect workspace at home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ergonomics calls for matching your workspace to your work needs. Rule number one is matching the top of your monitor to your eye level. However, setting a functional desk also requires other additional components that we will cover in just a second. But the perfect workspace requires, well, nothing at all. Yep, a clutter-less desk is one of the key components to optimizing your productivity. Some people swear by standing desks. These keep the posture correct, especially for those with more severe issues. And also allows you to take a healthy amount of breaks, which are just as much of a need during this work from home period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. The chair for your perfect workspace at home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>They key to not dozing off when working from home is creating a comfortable space that isn&#8217;t too comfortable. All you need is cushioning and ample armrest. Nothing more\/less. That is basically it to make your perfect workspace. Get a cushion to support your back and make sure your arms are slightly lifted at the shoulders at all times &#8211; if not, they cause your shoulders and neck to work overtime inflicting long term posture issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The backrest of your chair is possibly the most important component in keeping your posture in check, keep you working for the exact amount of time you need to, by keeping the pain away. We definitely recommend investing in a comfortable, quality chair to create your perfect workspace. <\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/yRT9ZgLxsUjNS\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/yRT9ZgLxsUjNS\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. The window<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Believe it or not, some people prefer working in slightly darker rooms. But countless studies show that natural light can charge our work-time productivity and make a substantial difference to our moods. Harvard Business Review goes as far as calling natural light, <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2018\/09\/the-1-office-perk-natural-light\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the number 1 perk employers can offer their employees.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason alone, we recommend setting up shop as close to a source of natural light as you can to create the perfect workspace at home. Even if you are working from your bed in a friend&#8217;s basement, optimize all sources of light through hacks like mirrors and clutter-less furniture. That fresh air is a great supplement for your 4th cup of coffee. Maybe not the 1st or the 2nd, but definitely for the 4th.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"10070\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/work-from-home-essentials-for-the-renting-roomi\/attachment\/perfect-workspace-at-home-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Perfect-workspace-at-home-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Perfect-workspace-at-home-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Perfect-workspace-at-home-2.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Perfect-workspace-at-home-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Perfect-workspace-at-home-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A boy sitting and working on his desk with natural sunlight coming in through the window.\" class=\"wp-image-10070\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Perfect-workspace-at-home-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Perfect-workspace-at-home-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Perfect-workspace-at-home-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.

Fake plants would probably not have the same desired effect here, as an actual plant comes with some added benefits like helping with stale air, for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also people who prefer adding accent pieces like a really fancy chair, maybe a cozy blanket nearby, a hanging desk?

The power<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There can honestly never be enough organizing for your perfect workspace at home. Every power-based device you use requires to be charged throughout the day and there are truly, few things as frustrating as a bunch of tangled wires stopping you from finding the one charging cable you are looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power strips also help you not overwhelm all of your outlets. And make it easier to not fight with your roommate over power points or trip accidentally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"10072\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/work-from-home-essentials-for-the-renting-roomi\/attachment\/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Power outlets with chargers\" class=\"wp-image-10072\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Dealing with the noise when you work from home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A highly recommended addition to office spaces in general is adding some sort of sound. The logic being, absolute silence can be distracting. White noise playlists are a great replacement for people who find it difficult to focus with lyrical music. There are also tons of &#8220;beats to chill\/work\/study to&#8221; playlists on YouTube and Spotify with fitting music that can help (increase) your focus. You might need to spend some time figuring what kind of music helps you focus best, so be sure to take your time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good pair of headphones are also a great investment if you are living with other people around the house. You can look to brands like Bose for top quality noise cancelling headphones &#8211; though there are also some really good cheaper alternatives available online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"10073\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/work-from-home-essentials-for-the-renting-roomi\/attachment\/music-when-working-from-home\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/music-when-working-from-home.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"music-when-working-from-home\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/music-when-working-from-home.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/music-when-working-from-home.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/music-when-working-from-home.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A man wearing headphones and working on his computer with sunlight coming in through the window to create the perfect workspace\" class=\"wp-image-10073\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/music-when-working-from-home.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/music-when-working-from-home.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/music-when-working-from-home.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it folks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers create the perfect workspace at home?
