But what features make the best roommate finder? To answer that question, it\u2019s important to understand how top features benefit the most important part of the equation. That is<\/span> you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Every roommate finder needs to have phone support.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The only thing that stands by your side during your hectic day from the moment you wake up to whenever you finally think about sleep is your phone. Some roommate finders provide it, but it ends up being such a watered-down version of the real deal that it just doesn\u2019t do it for you. A strong phone app benefits you because it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A roommate finder app needs to be focused on saving your time.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s face it, you can\u2019t afford to bounce between a desktop computer for this and a watered-down phone app for that like an over-caffeinated ping-pong ball. Because whoever made that stupid rule that a day should only have 24 hours has clearly never held two jobs before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Their goal should be to simplify your search.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is so much easier when you can do everything from a single source like a phone app. Your roommate search just went from the bottom of the procrastination list to the top of today\u2019s to-do list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The importance of lifestyle choices, and house rules!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">House rules will let two unique individuals live in blissful harmony, or serve as the basis for a nuclear meltdown in the courtesy department. They are also much more than just convenient search filter settings. They give you insight into who this person is. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are they a semi-pro-shopaholic? Or is the only plastic in their wallet a library card? <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Easily searchable lifestyle choices and house rules help you because<\/span>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>You gain an instant sense of who this person is<\/b>.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a glance, you can pick up on all sorts of personality traits, saving you major headaches after the lease is signed.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>You can search faster by filtering \u201cgotta have it\u201d traits and \u201cnot happening\u201d factors<\/b>.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>J<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ust checking or unchecking a few boxes saves gobs of time by excluding people you just know you can\u2019t get along with and focusing your search on those who could work out.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/images.pexels.com\/photos\/4126776\/pexels-photo-4126776.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Happy smiling young roommates in casual clothes sitting on floor with laptop and earphones and browsing smartphone together at home, having found each other on a roommate finder app\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Should let you get to know your roommates like you did your friends!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filters simplify your search life, but you can\u2019t really be sure until you\u2019ve interacted with a potential roommate. You\u2019re about to spend about a year with a total stranger, so investing a week or more to get to know someone before they move in doesn\u2019t seem like a lot to ask. And yet, many roommate finders don\u2019t offer that feature. Or if they do, it\u2019s through clunky email that feels more like blind-throwing messages in a bottle back and forth between trenches than actually growing to understand another person. Secure instant messaging is a key feature in great roommate finder apps. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It benefits you by:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Letting you get to know someone naturally<\/b>.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Texting back and forth was a fundamental part of how you got to know lots of the friends you have today. A roommate finder app shouldn\u2019t be any different.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>Keeps your personal information secure<\/b>.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving your personal email address to a complete stranger is not easy to take back. And yeah, most people are chill, but it\u2019s the smaller community of full-time whackos you have to watch out for. Secure texting lets you get to know somebody without exchanging your personal information so you can get a sense of whether this person is or is not a card-carrying member of crazy land.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you dash off to find a roommate finder with all those features, let us make it easy for you.<\/span><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roomi<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has all that and more.
