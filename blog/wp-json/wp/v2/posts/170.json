While that sounds fantastic, we\u2019re firm&nbsp;believers that an awesome roommate can be any age. Ever wondered what&#8217;s it like to live with a senior roommate? More importantly, the potential benefits coliving with the elderly provide? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll answer all your questions!

If you weren\u2019t considering it before, you might want to rethink it now. We talked to Sophia, a 29-year-old Harlem resident, who shared five unexpected benefits while coliving with the elderly, who we\u2019ll call Gabby for privacy\u2019s sake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. It Offers a Unique First-Hand Experience.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While senior roommates are using social media more frequently, they\u2019re still a little ways behind the younger generations. This&nbsp;means there\u2019s a wealth of knowledge seniors have that you can only discover by coliving with the elderly. Moreover, by interacting with them&#8230; in real life. And who knows what fascinating things you\u2019ll learn \u2014 especially when you\u2019re new to the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"12289\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/5-unexpected-benefits-senior-roommate\/attachment\/elder-roommate-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/elder-roommate-1.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1253&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1253\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"elder-roommate-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/elder-roommate-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/elder-roommate-1.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/elder-roommate-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a young girl and an old women looking at a phone\" class=\"wp-image-12289\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/elder-roommate-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/elder-roommate-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/elder-roommate-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/elder-roommate-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/elder-roommate-1.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/elder-roommate-1.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I learned a lot about how New York used to be,\u201d Sophia explains. \u201cGabby told me how New York City was in the \u201970s and \u201980s.

But she says Gabby, then 71, didn\u2019t mind at all if Sophia had a boyfriend or wanted to watch TV for three hours straight.

Loneliness can have detrimental effects on a senior\u2019s health, and having a roommate can help.
