However, with a couple of budges in the right direction, anyone can take up filing their taxes \u2014 and still, have the option of hiring professional help in their back pocket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax season dawns upon the American population in the middle of April each year. This sends a good clueless fraction of the population into quite the flux.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add to that the number of college students that pick up extra jobs increasing each year. We, therefore, witness an increase in the number of people who would qualify as first-time taxpayers each season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a compilation of the most asked questions by college students who are considering filing their taxes for the first time. Read on to find out more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related : <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/7-career-tips-for-college-seniors-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">7 Career Tips for College Seniors <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do I have to file taxes as a college student?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Determining if you should be filing taxes in a year is something that depends on how much income you made in that year. If your earned income (wages and tips) last year, was less than $6,300 and your unearned income (interest and dividends) was less than $1,050, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/refunds\">filing a tax return<\/a> isn\u2019t required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you made less than the minimum income required, you still might want to file taxes. Say you were working during any part of the year. And your employer took taxes out of your paycheck. Turns out, you might be able to get a fraction of that amount back as a refund for your effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a college student&#8217;s tax status?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/8c12cvfahEqP5O3dO2\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><p><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/evite-eviteirl-evite-irl-taxation-8c12cvfahEqP5O3dO2\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to talk to your parents before you decide to file taxes. While living away from home and having the choice of making your decisions may feel like adulthood, you may still be considered a dependant when it comes to taxes. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\">Anyone under the age of 24 pursuing an education in the United States can be claimed as a dependant<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS states that if you&#8217;re a student, your parents can claim you as a dependant until you&#8217;re 24. Thus, it&#8217;s wise to consult your parents about your status of dependency. This is because it may affect how you prepare for your return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How difficult is completing a tax form?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"6138\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/guide-to-filing-taxes-as-a-college-student\/attachment\/image-51\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-51.png?fit=1950%2C1300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1950,1300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-51\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-51.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-51.png?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-51.png?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"completing a tax form\" class=\"wp-image-6138\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-51.png?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-51.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-51.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-51.png?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-51.png?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-51.png?w=1950&amp;ssl=1 1950w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The difficulty of a tax form differs with every individual&#8217;s situation.

The 1040EZ can be considered the simplest tax form available \u2014 it&#8217;s a single page document available online as a form or in paper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve filled in the preliminary details such as your name, Social Security Number, and address \u2014 consider yourself halfway done!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your tax situation is a little complicated and you can&#8217;t use the 1040-EZ, then there&#8217;s the regular 1040 form. This form is relatively longer and more complicated than the 1040-EZ, but it isn&#8217;t more difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more clarification on&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/irs.gov\/forms-instructions\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">what form fits your tax situation and what documents you will be needed for the process, visit the IRS website.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does a college student file taxes?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"588\" data-attachment-id=\"6139\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/guide-to-filing-taxes-as-a-college-student\/attachment\/image-52\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?fit=2344%2C1345&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2344,1345\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-52\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?fit=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?fit=1024%2C588&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?resize=1024%2C588&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"a college student filing taxes\" class=\"wp-image-6139\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?resize=1024%2C588&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?resize=768%2C441&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?resize=1536%2C881&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?resize=2048%2C1175&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?resize=1200%2C689&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/image-52.png?resize=1980%2C1136&amp;ssl=1 1980w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways of going about filing taxes during tax season. You either do it yourself or pay someone to do it. If you&#8217;ve made less than $66,000 during the previous tax year and want to do your taxes yourself, you could use&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/irs.gov\/filing\/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FreeFile, the IRS\u2019 online basic tax filing software.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IRS also has an easy to use app that can be used to file taxes called IRS2Go.
