And in a city of thousands or millions you\u2019re bound to meet at least one person who disagrees with your politics. Luckily, no matter which candidate you\u2019re supporting during this heated race to the White House, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll find yourself in a tussle with a stranger unless you\u2019re actively looking for it.  But you need roommate advice because one of those people lives in your apartment? Well, that\u2019s a different story. So here&#8217;s how you can avoid political drama that lead to issues with roommates in the bud this election season. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your roommate is opinionated and passionate about their views, debate may be inevitable. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t avoid political drama that leads to issues with roommates. Political etiquette applies both in and outside the home. More so, if you want to avoid any <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-fix-your-relationships-with-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">major conflict <\/a>with the person with whom you share a wall. So before releasing your wrath, heed this roommate advice from fellow political junkies who&nbsp;sidestepped a fiery roommate issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Listen&nbsp;with an open ear to avoid political drama <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to know that communication is key to avoid political drama. So roommate advice here is that while you might be dying to have your voice heard, just know that you might never see eye-to-eye. And that\u2019s OK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cAgree to disagree. But keep an open mind. And have fun with your difference in opinion,\u201d says Tauhid Chappell, a web and digital content producer from Sacramento. \u201cWatching the debates together, for example, can lead to some bonding time over drinks, especially if you both dislike a particular politician. There are ways to find common ground, but the key is to be willing to listen to the other side.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And just in case things get too heated, Chappell recommends discussing things in a neutralizing environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cMy freshman year roommate \u2014 who was pretty conservative \u2014 and I agreed not to talk about politics in our room. But if we were out and about outside the dorms, we\u2019d occasionally talk about them knowing there were plenty of distractions around us that could help us change the topic.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take the high road and be respectful to manage issues with roommates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can\u2019t hold your roommate to bite their tongue, the least you can do is avoid adding fuel to the fire of roommate issues. It may not be easy&nbsp;but remember: You do have to&nbsp;<em>live<\/em> with this person. Don\u2019t say something you\u2019ll regret and <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-resolve-conflicts-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">can\u2019t come back from<\/a>. And when in doubt, just put yourselves in their shoes to avoid political drama, advises journalist Sumayya Tobah,&nbsp;who knows this first-hand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cAvoiding political drama has always been difficult for me. I usually wear my opinions on my sleeve, and I\u2019m not afraid to share them. But when living with someone, it\u2019s like a game of prisoner\u2019s dilemma. You have to play the game and cooperate until it\u2019s time to say goodbye,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way my roommate and my suitemate are talking about politics right now makes me feel like I\u2019m watching a debate on tv\u2014 Jennifer Forte (<a label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jenniferfortee?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">@jenniferfortee<\/a>) <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOne of my past roommates was very Republican. And keeping my opinions to myself was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. I think it\u2019s important to remember that everyone is shaped by personal contexts and experiences. And while I may not agree with their opinions, I absolutely respect their right to have opinions that differ from mine. So long as they show me the same respect. In the end, being able to find the humanity in other people is the best way to avoid political drama. &nbsp;Looking at a person and thinking, how did you come to these conclusions? What can I do, what example can I set, to make you change your mind?\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t take things too seriously<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, politics can be a great unifier or a divider. But even if you don\u2019t agree about everything, politics should not tear your home apart. So here&#8217;s roommate advice: If you can laugh it off, the better off you\u2019ll be post-election and you won&#8217;t have to deal with issues with roommates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cTry to keep any political discussions lighthearted. And don\u2019t use them as personal attacks on your roommates,\u201d says Josh Higgins, a cybersecurity reporter from Washington D.C. \u201cHaving lived in a house split evenly among Democrats and Republicans, we\u2019d talk politics a lot but we always made sure it was just fun political banter and not disrespectful arguments.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers avoid political drama with roommates?
