My NYC Roommate Is A Slob! What Should I Do"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>If your NYC roommate is a slob, it can be stressful at best and even evolve into a legit health issue. Especially in New York City, where humidity is higher, and apartments tend to be smaller, so there\u2019s really nowhere to go to escape the bio-hazard zone! So if you&#8217;ve encountered the following experience, we&#8217;ve got your back on <a href=\"https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/how-can-i-live-with-a-slob-5891488\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how to deal<\/a> with your roommate in NYC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You try to open the door to your apartment and hear the meaty thunk as it collides with your roommates discarded backpack. You can smell the festering rain boots from the bottom floor. Gritting your teeth in determination, you power your way through. Forging your way through the knee-high canyons of discarded unmentionables, kicking a pizza box of dubious origin using only the very tippy-toe of your foot. You\u2019re ready to pull your hair out over this mess, but there\u2019s already so much of it clogging the drain, why bother? Sound familiar?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/snl-saturday-night-live-season-45-ckTomRe0qPrqEL6YVF\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/ckTomRe0qPrqEL6YVF\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C276&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Snl GIF by Saturday Night Live - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"276\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got you! Here are five helpful tips to clean up your roommate in NYC before the Center for Disease Control starts calling you up for free samples. And three options for a Plan B if diplomacy breaks down and conflict ensues across the perpetually troubled living-room-to-bedroom border.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Talk about it to your NYC roommate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is so important but not as easy as it sounds. You have to live together with your roommate in NYC. Life is stressful enough trying to survive the workday without coming home to a room filled with so much tension you can pluck the air like a guitar string. But if you don\u2019t bring it up, they won\u2019t. So sit down and make sure you communicate what the problem is. Don\u2019t be confrontational or hose them down with accusations, even if you\u2019re right. (And let\u2019s face it, you so are.) Keep it calm, clean, and honest with your NYC roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/7-things-check-find-roommate-nyc\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">7 Things To Check Before You Find A Roommate In NYC<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Remember this is about persuasion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"11850\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/help-nyc-roommate-slob\/attachment\/roommate-in-nyc\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommate-in-nyc.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1255&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1255\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"roommate-in-nyc\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommate-in-nyc.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommate-in-nyc.jpeg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommate-in-nyc.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"talking to a nyc roommate\" class=\"wp-image-11850\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommate-in-nyc.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommate-in-nyc.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommate-in-nyc.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommate-in-nyc.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommate-in-nyc.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1047&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/roommate-in-nyc.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t really force your NYC roommate so you\u2019re going to have to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elitedaily.com\/p\/heres-how-to-talk-to-your-roommate-about-cleaning-without-making-even-bigger-mess-8707763\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">convince this person<\/a> to work with you. Taking a \u201crules are rules\u201d attitude might make sense logically, especially for organized people who are the first to raise concerns about sliding sanitary standards. But in reality, isn\u2019t going to gain a lot of traction with a slob. Slobs are the sloths of rebellion. They will break the rules on basic principle through simple inaction or by taking so long to clean something up, a glacier in the next ice age will mop your floor before they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Set clear goals and propose solutions with your NYC roommate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody can reach a goal if they don\u2019t know what it is.

Then have \u201cthe talk\u201d and present the new cleaning schedule, all in one session.

If a Buddhist priest watched you do it, they would give you the nod. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you are presenting yourself as a reasonable adult who is leading by example and offering solutions.
