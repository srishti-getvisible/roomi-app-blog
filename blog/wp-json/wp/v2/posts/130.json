Unfortunately&nbsp;not everyone has the luxury to jet set away, and plenty of folks may be spending the holidays alone. There\u2019s a chance your roommate is one of those people. Whether it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have time&nbsp;off to celebrate <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/easy-diy-hanukkah-decor-ideas-for-your-home-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hanukkah<\/a>, or the plane tickets are just too steep. So rather than having them sit in the apartment alone, why not invite them to spend the week with your family as a holiday friend? If this is the first time you\u2019re going on a holiday with your roommate, you might be wondering what\u2019s appropriate. Sure, inviting your roommate home for the first time can feel&nbsp;weird \u2014 but don\u2019t worry! Here\u2019s how to make the experience for your holiday friend the least awkward and most welcoming possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make it a point to ask your holiday friend certain questions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no point beating around the bush when inviting your roommate for a holiday. Although you might feel uncomfortable digging into your roommate\u2019s background to make sure they&#8217;re a suitable holiday friend. Being attentive will create a more welcoming, warm environment for them. Maybe your family&nbsp;partakes in a gift exchange every <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/fun-things-to-do-on-christmas-day-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Christmas<\/a>, but your roommate might not celebrate the holiday at all. Knowing information like this beforehand will prevent an awkward situation for everyone. Say, come Christmas morning, your roommate doesn\u2019t have a gift to offer. Or if their religion <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jw.org\/en\/publications\/books\/bible-teach\/true-worship-false-teachings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">prevents them from accepting gifts<\/a> altogether.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cWe never push our traditions or religious beliefs on anyone,\u201d says San Diego-based <a href=\"http:\/\/manorofmanners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">etiquette expert<\/a> Maryanne Parker of her own experiences hosting guests of different cultural backgrounds.<\/p><p>\u201cEverything should be based on mutual respect. I always explain how we celebrate [our holiday] and the meaning of the traditions. You should also learn about your roommate\u2019s religion if they practice one. In in most cases, if it\u2019s explained well, it will make sense.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if your family doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas but your roommate does, be upfront about your family\u2019s traditions (or lack thereof.) And ask about what traditions your roommate celebrates. Having an open discussion about their culture will be a great learning experience for you. And it\u2019ll also help them feel comforted knowing&nbsp;that you took the time to listen. And who knows how much you may discover you have in common on holiday with your roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cAlways look for similarities,\u201d Parker says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised how many positive ideas other seemingly different religions share with your own. The differences will be always there, but this makes life more enjoyable.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Be mindful of their dietary restrictions <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When welcoming someone into your home as a holiday friend, embracing their dietary restrictions and choices is a hugely important gesture. Food is a central part of any celebration. And the last thing you want to do is serve meat, alcohol or even caffeine to someone whose religious beliefs restrict them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cOne of my best friends was observing Ramadan over the holidays once, so out of respect, I refrained from eating or drinking around her or her family during the observation of their holy month,\u201d says Parker. \u201cAnd when she visits for Christmas, she can share some of the food we have while still following the rules of her religion. Because she doesn\u2019t eat pork, we\u2019ll serve turkey.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to make your roommate really feel at home on holiday? Whip up an easy dish he or she would normally eat at home. Even if it\u2019s nothing fancy, the gesture will go a long way. Texas-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.protocolschooloftexas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">etiquette expert<\/a>&nbsp;Diane&nbsp;Gottsman did just this when hosting her son\u2019s friend, going out of her way to make him feel more comfortable with a homey meal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cI asked for his favorite dish, which happened to be candied yams,\u201d Gottsman says. \u201cIt was so easy! At the table, my entire family included him in conversation and asked about his family traditions.<\/p><p>\u201cHe lit up sharing stories. He was appreciative, and before he left, he gave me a huge bear hug. His outward sign of appreciation made his visit even more special.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"12164\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/basics-inviting-roommate-home-holidays\/attachment\/holiday-friend-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/holiday-friend.jpeg?fit=1500%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"holiday-friend\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/holiday-friend.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/holiday-friend.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/holiday-friend.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A large family eating a meal together at the table\" class=\"wp-image-12164\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/holiday-friend.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/holiday-friend.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/holiday-friend.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/holiday-friend.jpeg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Combine traditions with your holiday friend<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the food to the decorations, no two families have the exact same traditions, even if they do celebrate the same holidays. For Olivia Cavalieri, an American student studying at Institut Sup\u00e9rieur International du Parfum de la Cosm\u00e9tique et de l\u2019Aromatique Alimentaire&nbsp;in France, celebrating the holidays with her live-in boyfriend\u2019s family took some getting used to after her own family\u2019s way of doing things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIn France you celebrate more on Christmas Eve, which is a huge contrast to my family\u2019s traditions where we usually just made a nice meal, ate as a family and put cookies out for Santa,\u201d Cavalieri says. \u201cHere, Christmas Eve is an all-night affair. I had no idea that there was going to be seven courses and stuffed myself on the appetizers and champagne.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than a typical Christmas ham and gingerbread cookies, Cavalieri describes how different holiday food is in France, noting that seafood is central to the menu, as well as other classic French dishes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThe buche de Noel doesn\u2019t look like our Yule logs decorated like actual logs, but instead are amazing cakes layered with chocolate mousse and raspberry filling,\u201d Cavalieri &nbsp;says.<\/p><p>\u201cMost people don\u2019t decorate their houses with lights because electricity is expensive. Instead the community puts up a lot of lights, lit banners that cross the streets, and beautiful designs on the light posts.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet while Cavalieri has learned to adjust to these new customs, she says it has made a huge difference knowing her boyfriend welcomes her traditions as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cHe fell in love with the idea of stockings when he was in America. And since I helped write everyone\u2019s name in glitter on stockings, we do them here in France with his family.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Open your home to them<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you may already live together, staying in your family\u2019s home can be intimidating for your roommate aka holiday friend. Be a pal and give them the heads up on&nbsp;what\u2019s socially acceptable with your family and the normal routine at your house. Have an uncle who gets a little too loud and political? Is your grandma likely to ask about your roommate\u2019s lack of love life? Yeah\u2026you should offer a fair warning to your holiday friend. Also don\u2019t forget that this isn\u2019t the home you share together. Your roommate isn\u2019t going to know their way around and might not feel comfortable asking, so give them the rundown to avoid any awkwardness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cGive clear directions so your guest doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. Remember to do simple things like give them the&nbsp;WiFi password,\u201d Gottsman says. \u201cShow him or her where extra towels, toilet paper, and toiletries are kept.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Having your roommate home for the holidays can be a lot of fun. And who knows what hilarious memories you\u2019ll create together to share next year?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers with tips when taking their roommate home for the holidays?
