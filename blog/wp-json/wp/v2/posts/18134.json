Some lucked out on Facebook, other found referrals through friends, and others may have braved the world of Craigslist. However, since these platforms aren\u2019t room finding portals specifically, they don&#8217;t always cater to your needs. Here\u2019s where room finder apps like Citru and a popular alternative of Cirtru, Roomi, step in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/roomi-hot-sicker-average-start\/241\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roomi.

Just going through tons of Citru reviews isn\u2019t worth the time, it&#8217;s much better to compare it with a popular Citru alternative, Roomi!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room\">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No one wants to scroll through listings endlessly when trying to find rooms for rent. The best room finder app should offer the ability to filter rooms according to your preference, for fast finding. Websites like Cirtru allow users to filter according to the price that fits their budget, type of accommodation and some specific requirements like pet-friendliness. However, when you\u2019re trying to find the best room finder, having a few more filter option helps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/science-roommate-makes-happier\/201\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">It\u2019s Science: Why Having a Roommate Makes You Happier<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s where Roomi proves to be a great <a href=\"https:\/\/competitor.roomiapp.com\/rooms-finder-compare\/cirtru-vs-roomi\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Cirtru alternative<\/a>. It not only allows you to filter rooms according to your budget and listing type, but it also has options to filter listings based on house rules like no smoking, vegetarian roommates and whether the listing is couple-friendly.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:55%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/xturgqU2FtXYhHjQdb\" title=\"roommate\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"no-fee-apartments\">\u2705No fee apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi allows you to list your rooms for free.

You can not only find typical amenities like Wi-Fi and a fridge but other not-so-common amenities like meal provision and security features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Cirtru you aren\u2019t able to filter rooms based on amenities, so if you have any specific needs you\u2019ll need to read each listing carefully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type\">\u2705Filtering rooms based on Listing Type<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On Roomi, you can filter listings based on whether the entire house is for rent, or a shared room or single rooms are up for grabs.

From typical rules like no smoking or drugs, you can also select listings that have a no boys or girls allowed policy.

When you opt for the monthly Roomi Gold subscription for $29.99 you get a fully verified profile that people can trust, a listing boost and additional listing credits so you can list more rooms for rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cirtru also has a premium plan for its users, which costs $29.99 and offers users a listing boost to help find roommates faster.

This room finder app also uses a GlobalID to verify their users\u2019 ID, which not only ensures the credibility of the user but protects their data as well. They not only have various verification levels but also have a 24 x7 in-house content moderation team that ensures that any scam or spammy listing is taken off the platform as soon as possible. In addition, users can easily report suspicious listings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cirtru requires users to verify their email address and their number when they\u2019re listing a room. With Cirtru, reporting a listing is slightly more complicated as you can only report a lister once you\u2019ve started a conversation with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you\">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve analyzed all features carefully, which one\u2019s the <a href=\"https:\/\/competitor.roomiapp.com\/rooms-finder-compare\/cirtru-vs-roomi\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">best room finder platform<\/a>?
