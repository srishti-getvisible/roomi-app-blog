When we do go out, however, our mouths are shut in masks and we feel suffocated, still.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if we happen to meet our friends and family, coming back to our apartment feels somehow worse, even if we co live with roomis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, coronavirus cabin fever!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines cabin fever as <strong><em>extreme irritability and restlessness from living in isolation or a confined indoor area for a prolonged time.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve all been feeling the symptoms of coronavirus cabin fever ever since the start of 2020. I think that&#8217;s a fair assumption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say the least, we&#8217;re sick of being in our apartments, and chances are, our apartments and roomis might have grown sick of us too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now while not everyone may feel the same symptoms or the same intensity of coronavirus cabin fever, it&#8217;s safe to assume that we&#8217;re all feeling it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here are some ways we&#8217;re dealing with the coronavirus cabin fever. Hoping you find solace in them too!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Learning to deal with isolation from the cosmonauts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So astronauts deal with <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/creative-things-self-isolation\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">self-isolation<\/a> for life, don&#8217;t they? When they&#8217;re not isolated, they&#8217;re certainly practicing or training for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if they co-live with other astronauts, and are not completely isolated, being in a space machine must be far tougher than what we&#8217;re having to deal with. Think how they can&#8217;t even go out for a bike ride or a long walk in the park with the masks on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1541739358-9f3a2a3b6559?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=967&amp;q=80\" alt=\"isolation, Coronavirus Cabin Fever\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So how do they do it?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we learned from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future\/article\/20200408-an-astronauts-guide-to-surviving-isolation\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">astronauts who spoke about isolation with the BBC<\/a>, the first thing we need to do is accept our situation and get comfortable with it. The fact of the matter is there&#8217;s no running away from our apartments and we&#8217;re all stuck in this together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to learn how to deal with the coronavirus cabin fever, we need to stop wine-ing and whining, and completely accept our circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Make a schedule that keeps you busy and entertained<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we talk of being entertained, the first thought that might pop up in our brains is <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/7-binge-worthy-netflix-shows-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Netflix<\/a> or other entertainment sites on the internet. Which is fine, but after a point of time, it might seem like these things are draining us out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they surely do! We lose track of time, we stop caring about our health and fitness, and the people we co-live with.And soon we become passive zombies looking for the next new distraction from the coronavirus cabin fever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1582812532891-7968f272fc9a?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=967&amp;q=80\" alt=\"coronavirus cabin fever\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How will a schedule help?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But we should realize that if we are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/how-to-work-from-home-with-roommates-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">working from home with roomis<\/a> in our apartments, we&#8217;re the lucky ones. And when you have luck on your side, it&#8217;s best to play our best game and get the best things out of our time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this would be possible only with a good schedule that includes taking care of our health and fitness.This includes <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/reddit-tips-for-when-you-cant-sleep-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a time to sleep<\/a> and wake up, a time to work, and a time to play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help the time pass easily without making us feel the dread of coronavirus cabin fever! So jot down all the things you wish to do in a day and make a schedule that supports those wishes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Move your body<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing to put in your schedule is a time and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/home-environment-and-healthy-living-habits-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">place in your home for health and fitness<\/a>. Whether your health and fitness regime is supported by a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/creating-a-budget-friendly-gym-at-home-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">home gym<\/a>, or a dance routine, or Yoga, there are limitless benefits of moving your body every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The serotonin (the happy hormone) flowing through your veins would keep you happy, energized, and productive. Bonus: you&#8217;ll find yourself dealing with the coronavirus cabin fever better when you work out for health and fitness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1487956382158-bb926046304a?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1051&amp;q=80\" alt=\"work out for health and fitness\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And since quarantine hit, we know we&#8217;ve been munching too much and thinking about health and fitness too less. So why not work out so you can fit into your old pair of jeans again?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Spend time with roomis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In times like these, the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/taking-coronavirus-precautions-with-roommates-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">roomis you co-live with<\/a> at your apartment are all you&#8217;ve got, whether you like it or not! So do the needful and carve out plans for some quality time with the roomis who co-live with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bond with them overcooking, or drinking, or just lazing around and watching movies. Social interaction is of utmost importance, and we&#8217;re all feeling the lack of it. Yes, even the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">socially anxious among us<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1601758003122-53c40e686a19?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1050&amp;q=80\" alt=\"two roommate spending time with their dogs \" width=\"610\" height=\"406\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What if there&#8217;s conflict?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, since we&#8217;re all stuck indoors with the roomis we co-live with, there&#8217;s bound to be conflicts too! So anticipate the conflicts that you might have to face and how you would resolve them. Also try and be on your best behavior. It&#8217;s a stressful time, even for the annoying roomi in your shared apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/bond-with-your-roommate-with-these-fun-traditions-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">make the roomis you co-live with feel loved<\/a> as often as you can and they would surely return the favor to help deal with coronavirus cabin fever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Pick up something new to learn<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now with our time alone at home, there are bound to be times when we&#8217;re tired of spending time and doing things with the roomis. So while you hibernate in your room, stop thinking about how bored you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1475275166152-f1e8005f9854?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1052&amp;q=80\" alt=\"a woman playing piano \"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, pick up a hobby or a <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/inspiring-quotes-to-help-you-learn-new-skills-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">skill you&#8217;ve always wanted to learn<\/a> to deal with coronavirus cabin fever.
