Often, it\u2019s not until the lease has been signed and everyone has settled into their new home that the roommate problems begin to show.

But if you\u2019ve already moved in with someone and you just hate being around them, what can you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Short of hiding out in your bedroom or moving back in with your parents, let\u2019s check out your options based on some common situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">They\u2019re a messy roommate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most common roommate problems out there. Does it sound familiar to you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><em>\u201cSo my college dorm roommate is still as messy as ever, which I believe I have been fairly tolerant of. However, her stuff continues to flood into my space, even after I&#8217;ve brought it up to her. I like to think I&#8217;m a direct person, and not a pushover, but I don&#8217;t want to seem pushy and keep asking her to make sure she keeps her stuff in HER space. The worst part is that this wouldn&#8217;t even be a problem if she would just use all of her drawer, cabinet, desk, and closet space. It&#8217;s really driving me mad how inconsiderate she keeps acting.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/badroommates\/comments\/a4fuv0\/messy_roommate\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Reddit poster ohgirlfitup<\/a>, you\u2019re struggling to co-exist with a messy roommate and have already brought up the problem, what steps can you take? It\u2019s easy to fall into a deep pit of resentment towards an inconsiderate roommate. But, bottling things up often just leads to an outburst from you (and then things get<em> really <\/em>messy.) <\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/OQrx03s8VwOl7XmfiZ\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/OQrx03s8VwOl7XmfiZ\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>But when talking things through doesn\u2019t lead to the nice, neat outcome you\u2019re hoping for, what do you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here&#8217;s some things you can try-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Pick your battles.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We get it; your messy roommate has habits that make your skin itch. But complaining about everything won\u2019t help. When dealing with a roommate, only confront them on bigger issues that truly obstruct your daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Assign your own spaces.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Determine which spaces \u201cbelong\u201d to each of you and which are communal. If their stuff crosses into your boundary, you can simply put it back into theirs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>Create a cleaning roster.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Write up a schedule of daily and weekly chores, so you\u2019re splitting the cleaning tasks evenly and you\u2019re not left feeling annoyed because you\u2019re <em>always <\/em>the one to scrub the bathroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Their social life doesn\u2019t match up to yours<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/badroommates\/comments\/7bosv7\/i_hate_my_roommate\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Reddit user handakun<\/a>, was sharing a bedroom with someone that rarely left the room and didn\u2019t seem to want to get to know her:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><em>\u201cLet&#8217;s call my roommate Tiffany (not her real name). She and I are both first years and we&#8217;re sharing a dorm room. When I first met her, she seemed really kind and genuine so I didn&#8217;t think much about it. However over time, I realized she doesn&#8217;t go out that much. She&#8217;s almost always in the room either watching videos, talking to her friends or family over the phone, etc. She doesn&#8217;t make any effort to get to know me or any of our hallmates.\u201d&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in a similar situation, it\u2019s time to mentally remove yourself and take an objective point-of-view. This is actually one of the better roommate problems to have. Okay; so your messy roommate parties less (or more) than you do. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re wrong for doing so. Everyone is different, and you may just need to set some boundaries between the two of you, or learn to accept that everyone lives their own life. At least, they&#8217;re not a messy roommate! <\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/1xkcamkSZKd6OKvSQN\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/1xkcamkSZKd6OKvSQN\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>As long as their lifestyle doesn\u2019t affect your quality of living (e.g. they\u2019re waking you up at crazy times), you can learn to live in harmony. Try taking part in activities together, such as cooking a meal, watching a TV series or inviting them out with your friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">They\u2019re generally difficult to live with<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, your roommate doesn\u2019t have just one annoying habit &#8211; they have lots! On top of being a messy roommate, they sleep with the light on in your shared room. They blast music you hate. Cook smelly food and then leave a mess. And loudly blending their green smoothie at 6 a.m. there&#8217;s just no end to your roommate problems!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve all been there. Dealing with a messy roommate who pisses you off on every level is really hard. But here&#8217;s how can deal with them better- <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Talk things out within 24 hours of a negative event to set rules and boundaries early on.<\/li><li>Don\u2019t address problems when you\u2019re already annoyed &#8211; stay cool, calm and collected.<\/li><li>Start the difficult conversation by apologising for not letting them know [insert roomi issue] annoys you at the beginning.<\/li><li>Suggest possible solutions or ways to land on some middle ground<\/li><li>Discuss issues in person, rather than via text messages.<\/li><li>Start by making a joke about the issue, to see if that fixes things up. Address it delicately and avoid veering towards sarcasm. If that doesn\u2019t work, address it more directly. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers with dealing with a roommate they don&#8217;t like?
