Looking for a new place to live, figuring out your transport routes, and so on, can be tiresome. This is why having a room finder to help you out is a great idea. Choosing the best website to find rooms for rent can be confusing because of the number of options available online. Here, we\u2019ve compared Roomi and PadMapper to give you an idea of what each offers. With this information at your fingerprints, you can then choose the best room finder for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3diE2vbIarCXWXaN15\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3diE2vbIarCXWXaN15\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room\">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re looking for a room, you probably already have an idea of the kind of things that are important to you. For example, you may want to live in an apartment that allows pets and smoking. Or if you&#8217;re looking for a roommate, maybe someone who&#8217;s quiet, non-smoking, and has no pets. Speaking to several roommates or landlords can become an exhausting process. This is why you should use a room finder to help you filter out things from the get-go and make the whole process simpler! We\u2019ve explored the most basic features any good room finder should have and compared Roomi and PadMapper across each of them. Read on to learn more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"no-fee-apartments\">No fee apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The PadMapper app and website have a filter called \u201cno broker fee\u201d which allows you to view listings with no additional fees on top of your rent. On Roomi, however, all listings are no-fee! That means you&#8217;ll know exactly what the room costs, with no hidden extras.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pet-friendly-apartments\">Pet-friendly apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/aDZAejU6KrjVu\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/aDZAejU6KrjVu\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Both room finder portals allow you to filter listings by whether they\u2019re pet-friendly. However, PadMapper only lets you select either cat or dog-friendly properties. Roomi goes one step beyond this and enables you to choose listings that allow other pets too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subletting\">Subletting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can sublet through PadMapper, you follow the same process as messaging the lister through the portal. Roomi helps you to sublet safely, by allowing you to request potential roommates to complete background checks. You can also directly chat with them securely through the app or website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/problems-of-co-living-with-too-many-roommates-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What Happens When You Share An Apartment With Too Many Roommates?<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities\">Filtering rooms based on amenities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The PadMapper interface allows you to filter amenities by typing out the amenity that you&#8217;re looking for, e.g. a washing machine. However, this quickly becomes tiring when you&#8217;ve got a lot of preferences to add. In contrast, Roomi has over fifteen amenities already listed that you can simply tick to filter your listings by!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type\">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both room finder portals allow you to filter rooms based on listing type. But like almost every point on this list, Roomi has that one little extra thing that pushes it ahead. In this case, with Roomi you can also filter by shared room or private room in addition to the whole place. PadMapper, on the other hand, only allows you to pick between different property types.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/moving-in-together-checklist\/\">Moving In T<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/moving-in-together-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ogether? Here\u2019s The Ultimate Checklist You Need To Follow<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules\">Filtering rooms based on House Rules<\/h3>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:55%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3otOKCOHz2gIlic63e\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/whatwedointheshadows-what-we-do-in-the-shadows-orchard-3otOKCOHz2gIlic63e\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an interesting feature that is actually super helpful but unfortunately not found on PadMapper. Roomi gives you a list of over ten house rules you can choose from to filter your searches. This will help you make sure that you and your potential roommates are on the same page before you agree to move in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pricing-are-these-room-finder-apps-free-or-paid\">Pricing: Are these room finder apps free or paid?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like with anything you\u2019re using to help you, it\u2019s important to keep in mind the monetary investment you\u2019ll be putting in and whether it\u2019s worth it. We\u2019ve taken a look at the costs of using the Roomi and PadMapper app to confirm whether they\u2019re free or paid, and what the advantages of each plan are. With all of these details, we hope you\u2019ll be able to settle on the best website to find rooms for rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"allowing-free-listings\">Allowing Free Listings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>PadMapper is a free, map-based room finder. While it doesn\u2019t have a paid option, it takes apartment listings from other websites like Airbnb and ForRent and puts them on a map in the radius you\u2019re looking in. There aren\u2019t any costs to sign up and you can view all the listings you want. Roomi on the other hand has paid and free versions. In the free version, Roomi allows all users to sign up and post listings for free. It&#8217;s also free to search through the listings to rent. The paid version also allows you to activate up to two listings a day on the platform itself!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-app-messaging\">In-App Messaging<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On PadMapper, there\u2019s no way to submit an application directly on the website. Instead, you can only contact the lister directly, which makes the process less safe. In the free version of Roomi, you can send up to five messages or swipes a day. What\u2019s more, with the paid Roomi Gold subscription at just $29.99 a month, you can choose between personal and business accounts. As a personal account holder, you can send unlimited messages, ID verification, and the highlight \u2013 a ranking boost that allows you to view seven times as many ratings! With the number of features you get with the Gold plan, investing is definitely worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/faq\/is-roomi-free-to-use\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Is Roomi free to use?<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible\">Security: How Do These Apps Ensure That The Listings Are Credible?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/RDZo7znAdn2u7sAcWH\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/RDZo7znAdn2u7sAcWH\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re moving to a whole new city, safety is one of the key aspects you want to keep in mind. You should always ensure that the room finder website or app you use to find accommodation considers this aspect. Whether it comes to trustworthy renters, roommates, or localities, it pays to do your research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To check that you are a real person, PadMapper asks you to connect your Facebook account for verification. Roomi takes a few more steps to make sure you and your details are safe. Firstly, the team only shows you rooms listed by people whose contact details have been properly verified. Listers have multiple options to choose from to verify their profiles and the level of verification is displayed for you to see. Secondly, if you feel something\u2019s wrong with a listing, you can report it to Roomi\u2019s 24\/7 moderation team. All in all, it\u2019s a great interface that keeps your privacy and safety top priority!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you\">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a room finder is great to make your life easier when you are hunting for a place to live in a new city! The best website to find rooms for rent is the one that helps you find everything you need in one place, with minimal effort on your end. Such room finders may appear impossible to find, but through this article, you\u2019ve probably realized that\u2019s not the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While PadMapper seems to be an easy interface to find room listings on, it definitely struggles to compete with the wide array of features offered by Roomi. To sum up, with Roomi you can rest assured that your room has the exact amenities you need and that your private details are safe. You can also be confident that you&#8217;ll be sharing your space with only the number of people you choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\" style=\"min-height:405px;aspect-ratio:unset;\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"has-white-background-color has-background-dim-100 wp-block-cover__gradient-background has-background-dim\"><\/span><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignfull is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:24% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"5969\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/shared-apps\/attachment\/roomi-app\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=1600%2C1066&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1066\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Roomi-App\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Roomi-App-best roommate finder\" class=\"wp-image-5969 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Roomi is your one-stop option to list or find rooms, find roommates to settle into a new city easily.
