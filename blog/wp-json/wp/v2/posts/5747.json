The best way to achieve this is by setting up a curtain, a shelving unit, or a traditional room divider, to create a separate bedroom environment.

If you don&#8217;t wish to exceed a couple of numbers at once, a large scale two-seater sofa would be just fine. Ottomans and smaller chairs would also make cute and effective additions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>What would be considered too much? Are there things you could give up completely to make your setup more streamlined? For instance, is there a cafe nearby where you could work instead of your apartment?
