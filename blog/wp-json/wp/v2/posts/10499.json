Moving to New York City is a fantasy for many, but this dream can come crashing down when faced with our credit scores. Looking for a place for rent in New York is a daunting task. Adding bad credit to the mix makes things even more challenging. Fear not, Roomi has tips that can still help you in finding an apartment in the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/1091-movie-halston-1H96wtGkwWrRbuJ58g\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media0.giphy.com\/media\/1H96wtGkwWrRbuJ58g\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C204&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"I Made It In New York GIF by 1091 - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"204\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-getting-started-finding-an-apartment-for-rent-in-nyc-when-you-have-poor-credit\"><strong>Getting started: finding an apartment for rent in NYC when you have poor credit<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So you know you have bad credit, perhaps too many student loans, or a variety of financial difficulties have put you in this difficult spot. Maybe you just hit the minimum payment option too much when paying off your credit card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start looking for help finding an apartment, it may be best to come to terms entirely with your credit situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you still have time before you start looking for a place to rent in New York, you may be able to salvage the situation to fix your credit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, get a copy of your credit score, sit down and identify exact problem areas where you may have fallen through. You can use free credit monitoring services like <a href=\"https:\/\/mint.intuit.com\/how-mint-works\/credit\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mint<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creditkarma.com\/?s=affiliate-tax&amp;adcampaign=tax_acq_impact_efile&amp;adgroup=10078_Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;adcopy=Online%20Tracking%20Link&amp;click_id=1a%3AzdcU3cxyLW9UwUx0Mo3QBUkEQ7O3gLSv5WQ0&amp;ovkey=12855&amp;returnurl=%2Ftax&amp;irgwc=1&amp;click_id=18Z2KMU3cxyLWzG0Rw0UrUzuUkEQ7O3gLSv5WQ0&amp;ovkey=2623632&amp;ovmtc=2623632&amp;%243p=a_impact_radius&amp;AppInstallRef=impact&amp;ShareId=&amp;subID1=&amp;subID2=&amp;subID3=&amp;%7Ecampaign_id=10161&amp;%7Eclick_id=18Z2KMU3cxyLWzG0Rw0UrUzuUkEQ7O3gLSv5WQ0&amp;%7Esecondary_publisher=&amp;s=impact_acq&amp;adcampaign=impact_acq_2019&amp;adgroup=Media%20Source%20Tracking%20Ad&amp;irgwc=1\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Credit Karma<\/a> to receive a breakdown of your credit history. Here you may notice some erroneous payments or simply a high number of credit cards that need to be paid off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit monitoring services are easily able to point out where your credit score went off the rails. Potential problems include high balances, multiple late payments, or overdue debt collections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"o4pXC3QuWp\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/hacks-to-help-you-find-the-perfect-apartment-in-nyc-roomi\/\">Looking For An Apartment In New York?

You can have a conversation with them, let them know about your limitations, and hope for the best response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in luck, they may empathize with you (especially given the COVID-19 financial crisis) and let you get away with giving a higher security deposit and just the first month\u2019s rent.

Perhaps you do not wish to put this burden on your family or friends. In this case, a rental cosigning company is a possible solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular choices in NYC include &nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.insurent.com\/renters\/\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Insurent Lease Guaranty<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/theguarantors.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the Guarantors<\/a>. International students often use this option when they do not know anyone locally to be their co-signer. Although the rental cosigning option comes with a fee, it will make your application stronger for rent in New York.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sublet-an-apartment-with-roommates\">Sublet an apartment\/ with roommates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Subletting an apartment with bad credit is a tricky option.

In this case, they are the ones who remain on the main lease. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way, you won&#8217;t directly have to deal with the landlord or provide your credit score.  But your trust quotient with roommates would need to be very high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"10504\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/bad-credit-when-finding-an-apartment-in-nyc-heres-help\/attachment\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2560,1707\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Roommates high-fiving when they have success in finding an apartment\" class=\"wp-image-10504\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1320&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/roommates-high-fiving-when-they-have-success-in-finding-an-apartment-scaled.jpg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-get-a-letter-of-recommendation-from-your-previous-landlord\"><strong>Get a letter of recommendation from your previous landlord<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like when you apply for a new job, a letter of recommendation speaks to your abilities and character.
