Earlier this year, we saw how COVID-19 sneaked up on us, reshaping our society in lasting ways. When an emergency strikes, it&#8217;s never expected. It could be an earthquake, or a family member falling ill. Even losing power for a few days is unthinkable, and we wonder about basic essentials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, chances are you might be working from home. And so, now with all of the above in mind, it makes sense to stock up mindfully for an eventuality. Now is the time for preparation \u2013 not to panic. Even if your local stores are open and stocked, you want to avoid crowded places and maintain distancing. While toilet paper and bottled water are flying off shelves, the list of COVID essentials is longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Shelf-stable food, groceries <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before purchasing food, check expiration dates, and plan out your consumption. Keep food allergies in mind and take only the necessities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Canned goods<\/li><li>Pasta<\/li><li>Cereals<\/li><li>Crackers<\/li><li>Granola bars<\/li><li>Dried fruits<\/li><li>Dehydrated foods&nbsp;<a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mountainhouse.com\/m\/shelf-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">like this 24-serving bucket with a shelf life of 30 years<\/a><\/li><li><a label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s\/ref=lp_16310101_nr_n_17?fst=as%3Aoff&amp;rh=n%3A16310101%2Cn%3A%2116310211%2Cn%3A16322721\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Chips, crackers, nuts<\/a><\/li><li>Other fun (but also healthy) food<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-perishable foods are a must for plenty of potential emergencies; they&#8217;re perfect COVID essentials food-wise. Protein bars and dehydrated fruit have long shelf lives and deliver high energy despite their small size.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/kE3eXBrZtqnEenJ3k9\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/kE3eXBrZtqnEenJ3k9\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Drinking water<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do not have a water filter and your tap water is unfit to drink, you could stock bottled drinking water. As per the Department of Homeland Security, on average, a person requires half to one gallon of water per day. But it depends on you to decide how many days of water supply you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3ov9jW5LkqPw06WDCw\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3ov9jW5LkqPw06WDCw\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Prescription medications<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can stock or refill essential drugs vital to you with the help of your doctor and pharmacist. This way, you avoid venturing out. This is especially helpful with the elderly at home as they are the most vulnerable when it comes to COVID-19. Also, you may want to consider some First-Aid kits as the time taken for ER admissions just keeps increasing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Toiletries<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a particular skincare routine that depends on specific products, now is the time to buy a few months&#8217; worths of those toiletries. All over the world, supply chains are being disrupted by the pandemic. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you need to worry about running out of basic essentials like soap, which many different companies make. However, non-essential toiletries, especially those made by smaller companies, might be out of stock for weeks or months. Here&#8217;s a list of basic toiletries that you should have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Toothpaste<\/li><li>Shampoo and conditioner<\/li><li>Contact solution<\/li><li>Deodorant<\/li><li>Antibacterial soap<\/li><li>Hand Sanitizer with a high alcohol content<\/li><li>Toilet paper<\/li><li>Tissues<\/li><li>Disinfecting wipes<\/li><li>Sanitary napkins\/tampons\/other feminine care products<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/7H1qil0e5xPG0\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/7H1qil0e5xPG0\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Cash for necessities <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic has brought in erratic incomes and uncertain months ahead, putting hard cash among COVID essentials. Jobs are at risk, and everyone is worried about second waves and more lockdowns. So, it is always good to keep some extra cash at home and in your bank in these tough times. You should limit yourself to essential spending, at least for the time being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Good healthy practices<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It may not be enough to have all that you need. Preventive steps with disease management is a good practice done regularly.
