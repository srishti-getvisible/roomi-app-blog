If you have recently graduated college or are graduating this year, don\u2019t feel pressure to find a job right away. Many college grads take time off after graduation before their next endeavor, whether that\u2019s graduate school, traveling, or entering the workforce. You don\u2019t need to have your life figured out by your early 20\u2019s!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While living at home, be sure sure to check in on your mental health. This is a stressful time for everyone, and we all <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/6-covid-essentials-to-keep-at-home-in-2020-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cope with the stress of the pandemic differently. <\/a>It is important to take care of our minds and check in with ourselves every once in a while. You&#8217;ve got this!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Class of 2020 or not, don&#8217;t forget to enjoy the time you have at home.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/cameo-graduation-graduate-class-of-2020-inJNMiGqM1CBAigtK1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media3.giphy.com\/media\/inJNMiGqM1CBAigtK1\/giphy.gif?resize=360%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"High School GIF by Cameo - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"360\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it: when will be the next time you\u2019ll be living at home with your family? We&#8217;ve seen so many college grads moving back home due to the pandemic, and worrying about losing that taste of independence once again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to view living at home as a positive instead of a negative! For one, you\u2019ll save a ton of money since you won\u2019t need to worry about rent or other expenses. Second, you can also enjoy time with your family. Cherish the time you have living at home and try not to view it as a setback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep building your resume!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/IntoAction-Srzor6ErxsOCXt9Pv4\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.giphy.com\/media\/Srzor6ErxsOCXt9Pv4\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Graduation GIF by INTO ACTION - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because you\u2019re living at home doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t keep adding to your resume. If you\u2019re currently unemployed and aren\u2019t having much luck finding a job yet, do other activities that you can put on your resume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many opportunities for online volunteering that you can do during COVID-19, which is a great thing to add to your resume. If you have a lot of free time on your hands, take online classes that are useful for the career that you want to go into. Don\u2019t feel stuck and instead view this as a time of opportunity!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep your search on, and your head held high.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/moodman-2020-Tjjr8OXolrue0evTMx\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.giphy.com\/media\/Tjjr8OXolrue0evTMx\/giphy.gif?resize=278%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"2020 GIF by MOODMAN - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"278\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t lose hope!

If you\u2019re really feeling stuck, reach out to your college\u2019s career services office and speak with them. Your college is still there to help you even after you\u2019ve graduated!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of attempting to help the class of 2020 amid the covid-19 pandemic?<\/strong> <strong>With our ever-increasing lists of rooms and roommates across the world, we help you find your perfect match! <a href=\"http:\/\/get.roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download the app here and hop on the easiest ride home, ever!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The world was different in 2020.
