As a result, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">apartments for rent<\/a> in Dallas \u2014 which has seen the\u00a0second-largest population boom in Texas \u2014 have become hot commodities. In a recent study of 11 major metros, Dallas\u2019s rental market saw the most significant change in availability. A 5% drop in its vacancy rate over the last decade. The North Texas city even beat out San Francisco where vacancy has decreased by 4 percent since 2006. Apartments for rent in Dallas are going fast and they\u2019re staying gone. Here\u2019s what else you need to know if you\u2019re planning on navigating the shortage of apartments to rent in Dallas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The State of Apartments For Rent in Dallas<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/2sizd1h6RrDQJdU5cJ\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media4.giphy.com\/media\/2sizd1h6RrDQJdU5cJ\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C236&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Texas Dallas GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"236\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Sizable Expansion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an <a href=\"http:\/\/furmancenter.org\/research\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NYU Furman Center<\/a> report that studied 11 U.S. metros between 2006 and 2014, the Dallas metro area increased its rental stock by 25 percent \u2014 &nbsp;an increase the study remarks is \u201csizable\u201d compared to other metros. Real estate investor <a href=\"http:\/\/heraldstrategies.com\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yariv Bensira<\/a>&nbsp;says the market in Dallas is ripe, from a developer\u2019s point of view \u2014 but at a cost to renters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cMore and more rental developments are going up throughout Dallas. And it seems more and more amenities are needed in new buildings to compete in order to command higher-end rents,\u201d he says.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And it isn\u2019t just apartments for rent that are contributing to the boom in units in Dallas. According to the NYU Furman Center study, a significant number of the new rentals are single-family homes, as homeowners choose more to rent their houses, adding new streams of income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Influx of Millennials<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"701\" data-attachment-id=\"12645\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/the-solution-to-a-shortage-of-apartments-for-rent-in-dallas\/attachment\/rent-in-dallas\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1287&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1287\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rent-in-dallas\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas.jpeg?fit=300%2C205&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas.jpeg?fit=1024%2C701&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas.jpeg?resize=1024%2C701&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"milennials sitting in a park\" class=\"wp-image-12645\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas.jpeg?resize=1024%2C701&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas.jpeg?resize=300%2C205&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas.jpeg?resize=768%2C526&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1052&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1073&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nationally, Millennials are leaning more towards renting today than owning. Perhaps because it offers a sense of flexibility that the generation is so well-known to love. In Texas, the <a href=\"http:\/\/austin.culturemap.com\/news\/real-estate\/04-06-15-texans-are-paying-more-in-real-estate-taxes-than-the-national-average\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">steep property tax rate<\/a> is an added incentive to rent. As a result, the competition for vacant apartments for rent in Dallas is fierce. As more renters enter the Dallas market, developers continue to outdo one another for new business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThere are young professionals and entrepreneurs flowing into Dallas from other urban centers and big cities. And they are used to luxury living in high-end buildings laden with amenities,\u201d Bensira says. \u201cThey are looking to stay in town and are willing to pay to do so.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And for those who&nbsp;<em>do<\/em> want to buy? The swelling property values mean scarier price tags, and ultimately it\u2019s a matter of choosing the lesser evil. There\u2019s no way, they say, to really have it all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why do people prefer to rent in Dallas?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cI think people aren\u2019t buying homes in Dallas because the cost of buying is also going up. I have friends who want to buy homes and condos. But it\u2019s really expensive especially to be in a generally nice area,\u201d says Betty Matthew. A Dallas-based speech language pathologist, who rents a townhome with two housemates in the city\u2019s Deep Ellum neighborhood. \u201cIf you want to buy a home, you have to move further away. Which people may be reluctant to do because of the longer commute to work and things to do in the city.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Decreasing Vacancy Rate<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=d4JFi3guLVE\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with a 25-percent increase in new apartments for rent in Dallas, the vacancy rate is still dropping. This is in part because the number of renters has increased by more than 35 percent since 2006. Of course, leaving a 10-percent deficiency in supply. As with any major metro experiencing the recent influx of renters. Low-income renters are having more trouble finding affordable housing in the city center. They\u2019re forced to either pay more to stay in the city. Or be pushed out into the suburbs and surrounding cities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Increasing Rent in Dallas and More Housemates<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" data-attachment-id=\"12646\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/the-solution-to-a-shortage-of-apartments-for-rent-in-dallas\/attachment\/rent-in-dallas-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas-1.jpeg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,375\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rent-in-dallas-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas-1.jpeg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas-1.jpeg?resize=500%2C375&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"apartments to rent in dallas\" class=\"wp-image-12646\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas-1.jpeg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-dallas-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>As&nbsp;multiple reports have shown, rent is rising nationally. Though rent affordability isn\u2019t as much of an issue in Dallas as it is in other major metros. Only 3 percent of vacant rentals in the North Texas city were considered affordable to low-income renters in 2014. And even for middle-income renters, a 3.8-percent spike in rent prices between 2013 and 2014 is somewhat unsettling. It\u2019s an indicator that the city, considered the most affordable of the 11 metros for median renter household, may be following suit of other more expensive metros.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThe cost of living in Dallas, although fairly low in Texas compared to other cities, is rising.\u201cThe rent has definitely gone up every year both in the city and surrounding areas. Even living in towns further away like Denton, my rent was going up every year,\u201d vouches Matthew.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Where does that leave newcomers seeking apartments for rent in Dallas? Hopefully not too overwhelmed; the choices are still available, and rent is still manageable for now \u2014 thanks, in large, to more housemates. The average household size increased by 8 percent in Dallas between 2006 and 2014. So it seems renters are wising up and rooming up to save some pennies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rooms-for-rent-in-dallas\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Find Rooms for Rent in Dallas <\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Should you Rent vs Buy a Home when Moving to Texas?\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rHucqqfVFaI?start=3&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And why shouldn\u2019t they?
