They\u2019re not just a fancy addition to a room &#8211; they can also help you demarcate specific areas in a small apartment. If you don\u2019t want to invest in a room divider just yet, you can also strategically place rugs around the apartment to create cosy nooks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get creative with storage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding enough storage space for one person is a feat in itself, but when you\u2019re sharing a studio apartment with your friend, you need to get creative. Apart from the usual spaces, try to incorporate additional storage using hooks or buying multipurpose furniture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay organised<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When sharing a studio apartment, organisation is key. You cannot leave your things lying around as if you are living alone. And the best way to ensure that your roomie respects your space? Make sure that you are respecting theirs!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pack away anything that you aren\u2019t using, and try to reduce clutter as much as possible. Not only does this help your studio apartment seem more spacious, but it also helps you be a good roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/sharing-a-kitchen-a-guide-to-peacefully-share-a-kitchen-with-roommates\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sharing a Kitchen: A Guide to Peacefully Share a Kitchen with Roommates<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can 2 people live in a studio?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Disagreements are common, even when you\u2019re living with your friends.

Decide who is going to pay for the utilities and who is going to do the grocery shopping ahead of time. Plus, you&#8217;ll want to discuss the ground rules for things like having guests over.
