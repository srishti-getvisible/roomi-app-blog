Hence, it is crucial that you both feel comfortable and at home. Being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.queertheology.com\/tag\/trans-allies\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a good ally<\/a> and a supportive roommate is, thus, crucial to ensure that your roommate feels at ease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/7-tips-for-getting-along-with-a-roommate-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Getting Along with a Roommate Made Easy<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Allies usually mean well, lack of knowledge or familiarity with the LGBTQ+ community can inevitably make for some awkward situations. When you want to ensure that you\u2019re a Queer-friendly roommate, keeping a few terms and concepts in mind can help you understand them better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"5 Things Trans People Want You To Know \/\/ Trans Awareness Week\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pDYiesH5JYg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-understanding-the-difference-between-gender-trans-and-non-binary\">Understanding the Difference Between Gender, Trans and Non-binary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Language is a powerful tool, but sometimes, we can unknowingly hurt people with the words we use. Language within the LGBTQ+ community can be diverse, and when you want to be a LGTBQ+ friendly roommate, understanding different terms can help you make your transgender, non-binary, lesbian or gay roommate feel at ease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-gender\">What is Gender?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gender is an internal sense of self which can be expressed in several ways, commonly through clothing, pronouns and behavior. Often, gender is linked to stereotypical ideas of femininity and masculinity. Gender is what you feel you are, whether it is male, female, or having no strong feelings towards any gender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people identify with the same gender they were assigned at birth. This is known as being cisgender. Some people feel that they are a different gender than what they were assigned at birth. They may identify as transgender or non-binary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-trans\">What is Trans?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glaad.org\/transgender\/transfaq\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trans or transgender<\/a> is an inclusive umbrella term. With this term people can either refer to a transman, transwoman, people who cross-dress or even non-binary people. Broadly, it is used to refer to anyone who does not identify as cisgender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-non-binary\">What is Non-binary?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who feel that their sense of gender cannot be defined by the traditional gender binary use the term non-binary. For them, their understanding of their gender can go beyond a sense of feeling like a man or a woman. While some non-binary people may feel comfortable in trans communities, as it is a way of meeting non-cisgender people, it is not true for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that this is not all there is to learn about gender and gender-expression, but it is a good place to start. Interacting with more people of the community and keeping an open mind can help you learn more about the different ways in which people identify themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related:<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/9-reasons-why-living-with-a-roommate-is-awesome-roomi\/\">9 Reasons Why Living With A Roommate Is Awesome<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-be-a-good-ally-what-you-should-know\">How to Be a Good Ally: What You Should Know<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you may consider yourself to be queer or LGBTQ+ friendly, expressing it is important. You should not only be supportive of your gay roommate, but make them feel comfortable as well. Every person is unique; hence, it is important not to generalize one person\u2019s experience to the entire community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as you would assume that every straight person does not behave the same way, it is important to remember that every transgender person may not be the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how can you become a better ally to make your transgender roommate feel comfortable?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Trans 101 - The Basics\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-3ZzpTxjgRw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-don-t-assume-their-sexual-orientation\">Don\u2019t Assume Their Sexual Orientation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, people confuse gender identity and sexual orientation. Gender identity is the expression and sense of self, but sexual orientation refers to who people are attracted to. Transgender people can identify as straight, gay, lesbian or bisexual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-use-correct-pronouns\">Use Correct Pronouns<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When referring to your roommate, ensure that you use the right pronouns. If you aren\u2019t sure which pronouns to use, you can either listen to what pronouns others use for them, or ask them yourself. A good example of asking for pronouns would be, \u201cHi, my name is __, I use he\/she and her\/him. What about you?\u201d If you accidentally use the wrong pronouns, ensure that you apologize, but move on from the situation and not make it a big deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" data-attachment-id=\"13166\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/coliving-with-a-transgender-roommate\/attachment\/hello\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Hello.jpeg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"600,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Hello\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Hello.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Hello.jpeg?fit=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Hello.jpeg?resize=600%2C400&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"pronouns for transgender roommates \" class=\"wp-image-13166\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Hello.jpeg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Hello.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-don-t-ask-them-for-their-birth-name-or-real-name\">Don\u2019t Ask Them for Their Birth Name or Real Name<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone introduced themselves to you, you wouldn\u2019t ask them if it was their \u201creal name\u201d, and it shouldn\u2019t be different for transgender people as well. Some transgender people continue to use their birth name, while others feel that it is a part of their life they want to leave behind. If you happen to know someone\u2019s name before they transitioned, do not share it without their permission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-be-patient\">Be Patient<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone is trying to figure out their place in the world, and whether they are a member of the LGBTQ+ community or not. While we may not understand other people\u2019s experiences, it is essential to be patient with them, no matter who they are. Ensure that you listen to your roommate, understand their needs and provide them with a listening ear. This tip is useful even if you aren\u2019t living with a gay roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/faq\/how-do-i-browse-people-roommates-on-roomi\/\"><strong>How do I browse people (roommates) on Roomi?<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\" style=\"min-height:100vh;aspect-ratio:unset;\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff\"><\/span><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:56% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"216\" data-attachment-id=\"13167\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/coliving-with-a-transgender-roommate\/attachment\/roomi\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Roomi.png?fit=1684%2C356&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1684,356\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"transgender roommate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Roomi.png?fit=300%2C63&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Roomi.png?fit=1024%2C216&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Roomi.png?resize=1024%2C216&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"transgender roommate\" class=\"wp-image-13167 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Roomi.png?resize=1024%2C216&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Roomi.png?resize=300%2C63&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Roomi.png?resize=768%2C162&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Roomi.png?resize=1536%2C325&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Roomi.png?resize=1568%2C331&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Roomi.png?w=1684&amp;ssl=1 1684w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color\" id=\"h-can-t-find-a-transgender-roommate\" style=\"color:#000000;font-size:32px\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><strong>Can&#8217;t find a Transgender Roommate?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color\" style=\"color:#000000;font-size:17px\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">A common problem that many LGTBQ+ people face is the inability to find queer or gay roommates.
