And in most competitive rental markets, tenants usually end up dealing with middlemen known as brokers. Apartments in New York have known the broker&#8217;s fee for a long time. The pandemic caused shifts in the rental market of 2020. And the consequences were felt by anyone dealing with renting in NYC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/season-20-the-simpsons-20x1-3o6Mb9dFLx0lZsqncI\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media1.giphy.com\/media\/3o6Mb9dFLx0lZsqncI\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Homer Simpson Marketing GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/apartment-rental-fees-can-landlord-legally-charge\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What Apartment Rental Fees Can My Landlord Legally Charge Me?<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the standard broker&#8217;s fee in NYC?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Brokers in NYC have near-absolute control over apartment listings, viewing appointments, and leases. In return for their services, <strong>broker&#8217;s fees in NYC can be as much as 15% on the annual lease.<\/strong> This is typically paid in one lump sum by tenants before they can move in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the pandemic changing things, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/11\/12\/big-drop-in-manhattan-rental-prices-lures-back-younger-residents.html\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CNBC reported that the prices to rent and buy property in NYC dropped<\/a> so much that younger renters were found returning to the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, low rent prices quickly turned into high broker fees. It&#8217;s also important to note that NYC is one of the few cities in the country with a broker industry. And it&#8217;s one of the few cities that has financial leverage over how people rent apartments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brokers used the new surge in renters to their advantage and started charging high fees. Earlier this year, charging a broker&#8217;s fee was banned in the city, but it was a temporary ban.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is the broker&#8217;s fee in NYC legal?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1602325978229-fc2d478ffba7?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" alt=\"rent in NYC is a highly competitive, especially close to areas like radio city where the broker's fee in NYC itself is 15% of the annual rent\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In early February of 2020, the New York State effectively eliminated broker&#8217;s fees. NYC state regulators said renters can no longer be charged broker fees. With the elimination of broker fees in NYC, the state of New York holds an extreme potential to become one of the most favorable rent locations in all of the US.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new rule, buried in legal guidance on last year\u2019s rent laws, caught lawmakers, many landlords, and brokers off guard. But it&#8217;s safe to say that the tenant advocates cheered the new broker fee rule. Mostly because it helps tilt an uneven real estate playing field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why was the broker fee in NYC eliminated?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This new law was primarily aimed at protecting tenants and strengthening rent regulations. It mentions that tenants can be charged no more than $20 in fees when applying for an apartment, including background and credit checks. Previous rent laws have also capped security deposits at one month\u2019s rent, further diminishing the lump sum amount renters typically must pay before being given keys to an apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that the burden for broker fees in NYC falls directly on the landlords. Or they can choose to list, market, and lease their units on their own. <strong>The changes could effectively turn New York\u2019s rental market into a no-fee market.<\/strong> <strong>That is if renters choose to hunt for an apartment without hiring a broker.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where does the banning of broker&#8217;s fees in NYC stand today?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1602325978196-37650f5d3203?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80\" alt=\"man in black jacket and black pants riding on black motorcycle on road during daytime on his way to pay broker's fee in NYC\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Much to our dismay, banning broker fees in NYC has proved to be a slow process, and experts believe it&#8217;s going to take much longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a temporary restraining order that blocks the new guidance on renting in NYC from taking effect, so if you\u2019re in the process of renting an apartment, you\u2019ll still have to pay the broker\u2019s fee. A tenant would also have to pay the fee if they, rather than the landlord, hired a broker to help them find an apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What\u2019s the Late-Fee Policy, &amp; 19 More Questions To Ask Your Landlord Before Moving In<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Now that there\u2019s a legal challenge to the ruling\u2014do I have to pay the broker&#8217;s fee or not?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the court process grinds along, the real estate market has changed significantly. And with rents dropping and working tenants harder to come by, broker fees \u2014 are at least for now \u2014 becoming scarce in areas like Manhattan. However, in other parts of the city, like Astoria, Queens, most of the listings are still asking for a fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers figure the ins and outs of renting and broker fees in NYC?
