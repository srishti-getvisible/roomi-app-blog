But it can become a cause of great panic for some. From budget cuts to being out of a job, any scenario that affects your income ultimately affects your living situation. Especially when you think you can&#8217;t pay your rent and you don&#8217;t see any rental assistance in view.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can&#8217;t pay your rent, you might even fear eviction. And there&#8217;s a lot of doubt and panic that surrounds renters in this pandemic stricken era.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of us might be barely making it, and some of us might not be making it at all. Even if you&#8217;re actively looking out for another job, the job conversion might end up taking more time than we&#8217;d like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us to a very crucial question. What to do if you can&#8217;t pay your rent due to coronavirus?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve put in the research and have gathered some things you should do if you can&#8217;t pay your rent. One of the most important things that we&#8217;d like you to remember is NOT to lose hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some things you should look into if can&#8217;t pay your rent. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Research your state&#8217;s eviction protection programs if you can&#8217;t pay your rent<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Things look grim with the CARES Act as a rental assistance. As it applies only to a few properties regarding rent, and the act itself expiring. But you need to know where your state is with regard to the <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/how-coronavirus-has-impacted-rent-prices-in-u-s-cities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">impact on rent due to coronavirus<\/a>. Also whether you can get any aid if you can&#8217;t pay your rent. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out whether your state is renewing the ban on evictions or not. If your state is not doing anything to help and you fear financial delinquency, get in touch with a lawyer for free with <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.lsc.gov\/what-legal-aid\/find-legal-aid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Legal Aid<\/a>. Understand your rights and what course of action would be best for you if you&#8217;re unemployed and can&#8217;t pay your rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Tell your landlord that you can&#8217;t pay your rent<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best rental assistance for you would be if your landlord understands that you can&#8217;t pay your rent. And if they&#8217;re willing to make a compromise in terms of rent. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we&#8217;ve come across both types of landlords in the news. The ones who have foregone any rent from their renters until they manage to find a source of income. And those who are staying rigid when it comes to rent. Or even inflicting more unreasonable terms concerning any stimulus check or aid you might be receiving if you&#8217;re unemployed (if any).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you should try your best to convince your landlord to agree, don&#8217;t give in to unreasonable demands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Suggest restructuring rent payments till things get better<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been a good renter and have always paid the rent on time, the chances are that your landlord will understand if you can&#8217;t pay your rent right now. Try speaking honestly with your landlord about your situation. Also inform them of how long you expect to take to get up back on your feet again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the conversation, if your landlord agrees to help you out, make sure you put it all on paper with signatures. Simply so there&#8217;s no chance of them retracting from their word in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Reach out to local aid when you can&#8217;t pay your rent<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately enough, some organizations are actively working to offer rental assistance if you can&#8217;t pay your rent, and face the risk of eviction or homelessness due to coronavirus. Reach out to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hudexchange.info\/housing-and-homeless-assistance\/homeless-help\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">state&#8217;s housing organizations <\/a>and<a href=\"https:\/\/nlihc.org\/rental-assistance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> housing assistance<\/a> to take the help that you need. You can find out about the organizations<a href=\"https:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/interactive\/2020\/health\/coronavirus-how-to-help\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> working to help and get help <\/a>for people (in terms of rent, food, and other necessities) most affected by the pandemic financially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Apply for a loan<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If nothing works out, you can find out what<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/03\/20\/what-banks-are-doing-to-help-americans-affected-by-coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> banks are doing to help citizens affected by the coronavirus pandemic<\/a>. Leverage the rental assistance plans on offer and take out a loan while you hustle to get a viable source of income. Don&#8217;t worry about an increase in debts if a much more significant concern for you is that you can&#8217;t pay your rent. Remember to take one step at a time to solve your problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Take in more roomis or move out<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">List your room<\/a> to find another roomi. Even though you might end up being cramped for space, you&#8217;ll be helping yourself and others. If your landlord isn&#8217;t onboard, tell them that you can&#8217;t pay your rent alone and make them understand that this could be the only way you would be able to manage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can&#8217;t afford your current place, find a cheaper room or bunk in with friends or family till things settle down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they will, soon enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers when they can&#8217;t pay rent?
