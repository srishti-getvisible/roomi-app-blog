(Chances are there are a handful of mouthwatering places on your block alone.) But as much those dollar slices and falafels are calling your name, your wallet and waistline will take a major hit if you aren\u2019t equipped to prepare some of your meals in your shared kitchen. That&#8217;s when you obsessively start looking up kitchen hacks and quick recipes and you end up here. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, where do you go from here? While we\u2019d all love to go on a massive shopping spree through William Sonoma, the moving process doesn\u2019t leave much wiggle room in the budget for kitchen gadgets. So we checked in with the pros to see what they put on their list of must-haves when stocking a new kitchen. These essentials can mean the difference between an ever-growing takeout bill (and pant size) and delicious, homemade meals in minutes. Here are the first five things nutritionists buy when stocking a new shared kitchen, with our top picks for the splurge vs. steal. Grab a pot, some groceries and your roommate \u2014 it\u2019s time to cook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Get a toaster oven for your shared kitchen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So basic, and yet so useful, the&nbsp;toaster oven will become your new best friend on nights when your roommate decides to finally give that fancy 20-step Pinterest recipe a try (hogging all the pots and pans), or on days you get tied up at the office and just want to whip up an easy meal. In fact, some of the easiest <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi\/\">kitchen hacks<\/a> involve a toaster oven!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThe kitchen gadgets that really count are those that get to take up the precious real estate on the countertops.. My first choice is a toaster oven. Unlike a toaster, with a toaster oven you can heat up items you might otherwise need to put in an oven (like a slice of pizza) or dinners in metal containers that you aren\u2019t able to put in the microwave, and cook items to a delicious crispness (like roasted potatoes).&nbsp;You can make a quick meal for one by baking a chicken cutlet in the toaster oven \u2014 just place on a tray and add some seasoning, a drizzle of balsamic glaze and a drop of olive oil. Add to a salad and you\u2019ll have a great, low calorie lunch or dinner.\u201d<\/p><cite><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bonnietaubdix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bonnie Taub-Dix, RD<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Splurge:<\/strong>&nbsp;<span id=\"productTitle\" class=\"a-size-large\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Cuisinart-TOB-40-Classic-Toaster-Broiler\/dp\/B004JMZGM2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler<\/a>, $79.95<\/span><br> <strong>Steal<\/strong>: Black &amp; Decker Black Toaster Oven, $29.99<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3ohjV9tulJSzrH1V4s\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3ohjV9tulJSzrH1V4s\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Food Processor<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does it store easily in a small cabinet, but this handy gadget will majorly cut down on meal prep time. You can chop and mince ingredients in minutes. It&#8217;s one of the greatest kitchen hacks ever! Plus, think of all the smoothies you\u2019ll be making in your shared kitchen!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cA must-have pick for my first kitchen was a small, countertop food processor \u2014 not a huge, expensive KitchenAid, but a tiny one that\u2019s perfect for a super small apartment or studio. In fact, I still use my tiny processor all the time in my current kitchen, which is larger than my first&#8230; Having a food processor of any size is a must if you plan to make vegetables a regular part of your meal plan, which of course we all should! If you\u2019re very short on space, it can even sub as a small blender (you can make smoothies in it!) and it\u2019s great for making servings for one, so if you live on your own you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re going to have large amounts of food waste.\u201d<\/p><cite><a href=\"http:\/\/www.erinpalinski.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Erin Palinski-Wade, RD<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Splurge:&nbsp;<\/strong><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Cuisinart-DLC-10SY-Classic-7-Cup-Processor\/dp\/B01AXM4SB6\/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Cuisinart+DFP-14BCN+Food+Processor&amp;qid=1618373987&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFWU0NYUFk5V0ZIMDYmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA3NzMyNzY2TE1HUFFaR0M5RjYmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDQxMjk2NTFSWjVGMjQ1QjFMSUUmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cuisinart DFP14BCN Food Processor, 14 Cup<\/a>, $119.95&nbsp;<strong><br> Steal: <\/strong>Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Food Processor, 3-Cup, $39.95<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3oEduNF7DlpxgcHVJe\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3oEduNF7DlpxgcHVJe\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Dutch oven is a must for your shared kitchen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Dutch oven is the perfect addition to a co-living household and those awesome potluck dinners you\u2019re dying to have. But make sure to choose a vibrant color. So, the nest time you host friends for a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi\/\">dinner<\/a>, you can bring it right to the table! Save yourself a dirty dish. That&#8217;s one of the most useful kitchen hacks out there!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cOne of my first, and most essential purchases, was my big 7-quart Dutch oven. It\u2019s still a fixture in my kitchen, some 8 years later&#8230; As a graduate student, I used it to make all sorts of one-pot meals to get me through the week, like soups, stews, hearty pasta sauces, and curried chicken. It also doubles as a kitchen decor piece if you leave it out on the stove \u2014 I didn\u2019t have enough cupboard space in my tiny studio to hide it away, anyway!\u201d<\/p><cite><a href=\"http:\/\/www.everydayhealth.com\/columns\/johannah-sakimura-nutrition-sleuth\/author\/johannahsakimura\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Johannah Sakimura, RD<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Splurge:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.williams-sonoma.com\/products\/le-creuset-signature-oval-dutch-oven\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Le Creuset Cast Iron 3.5-Qt.

And that&#8217;s a super easy way to up your fruit and veggie intake.

Sakimura counts as one of her most essential early purchases.&nbsp;If you go for the splurge and invest in a high-quality knife, Sakimura recommends getting it professionally sharpened once a year.

I went with the Wusthof Classic Ikon because I loved the weight and clean design. Talk about a good investment! I still use it almost daily, eight years later, and it has held up beautifully, despite slicing more than its fair share of produce, including countless watermelons and butternut squashes (I\u2019m a nutritionist after all!) I\u2019m sure I should have it done more frequently, but it seems to hold up fine!\u201d<\/p><cite> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.everydayhealth.com\/columns\/johannah-sakimura-nutrition-sleuth\/author\/johannahsakimura\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Johannah Sakimura, RD<\/a> <\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Splurge:<\/strong> W\u00fcsthof Classic Ikon Chef\u2019s Knives, $139.99-$199.95<br> <strong>Steal:<\/strong> W\u00fcsthof Pro Chef\u2019s Knife, 8\u2033, $24.95<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers buy the best equipment for their shared kitchen?
