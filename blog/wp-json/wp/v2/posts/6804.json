You\u2019re right in the middle of figuring out who you are, what you want out of life, and not to mention, making awesome memories!

This is why you need some tips on how to save money so that you can set yourself up for a bright future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you\u2019re too young to be worried about money and savings in your 20s, think again. Your 20s are a time when you&#8217;re the most financially vulnerable in your professional life. This is why having savings becomes even more important. But don\u2019t freak out. We\u2019ve got your back. Because this is so important, we\u2019ve compiled a list of very helpful tips on how to save money. Take a look now and your future self will thank you later!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/26BRCPDmtpvBsutpe\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/26BRCPDmtpvBsutpe\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tips on how to save money: How much should I actually be saving?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts say that as in your 20s, your savings should be around 25% of your monthly income, before taxes and other deductions. Now I know 25% seems like a lot of money to save, but it includes any retirement plans you may have (we\u2019ll talk about this in detail later). So, saving 25% every month actually isn\u2019t all that bad once you break down the costs. And of course, if you follow our tips on how to save money, it will be a whole lot easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.moneyunder30.com\/percentage-of-income-should-you-save-every-month\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here is a really helpful guide<\/a> to help you figure out how to break down your costs on a monthly basis!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">See Also: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/5-simple-money-saving-tips-during-quarantine-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How To Use Quarantine As A Money-Saving Opportunity<\/a>\n<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>\u201cWhat are my goals?\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you spend approximately 90% of your 20s asking yourself this very question (The other 10 percent is spent asking what you want to eat for dinner). But your savings largely depend on what you want out of life. Maybe you want to travel the world one day or have a destination wedding. If you want to buy a three BHK by the time you\u2019re 30, you better start saving a lot more money. These tips on how to save money will only help you if you know what goals you\u2019re working towards. So, before anything else, find out what you want your future to look like.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/daasWol3l8f155ITtr\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/daasWol3l8f155ITtr\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Become a habitual saver!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know saving money is really hard for a lot of people. I mean, there are distractions everywhere. I mean, even Instagram has a shopping option now, for god\u2019s sake! But for the sake of your future self, you need to get your spending under control. Your Savings build up over time, but they can also deplete over time if you don\u2019t keep a check on it. These would not be good tips on how to save money if we didn\u2019t show you a couple of tricks to cut down your spendings. You can start with shopping at more affordable grocery stores and buying canned goods whenever you can. Try shopping at thrift stores where you get a wide variety of clothes at a fraction of their original cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/personal-finance\/2018\/09\/18\/20-ways-to-cut-spending.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here\u2019s a more comprehensive list<\/a> of things you can do to spend less money!<\/pre>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/TiO83XhZ8nOjr2kWQG\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/TiO83XhZ8nOjr2kWQG\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/the-best-money-saving-apps-to-reach-your-finance-goals\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Best Money Saving Apps to Reach Your Finance Goals<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>In the case of an emergency!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most important points in this list of tips on how to save money. Having some money for emergencies is really important. You cannot predict the future, but you can certainly prepare for it. Not having an emergency fund can have terrible consequences. In the case of an emergency, you might find all your savings gone. So, set aside some money each month in your emergency fund. It doesn\u2019t have to be a lot, just 1% or 2%. If you do just this for even eight months, you\u2019ll have a good size fund for your 20s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p><strong>Roomi tip-<\/strong> Make sure this fund is completely liquid.
