Fortunately, Sean wasn\u2019t home when the fire was blazing. Unfortunately, all of his stuff was. T<\/span>he fire consumed his c<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lothes, computers, cameras, his bike <\/span>and <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he had no renters insurance living in NYC. He heard about the fire through Twitter before ever seeing it for himself. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My friend Sean didn&#8217;t even know about renters insurance.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A<\/span>nd <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sean wasn\u2019t prepared for this situation,<\/span> like most New Yorkers aren&#8217;t<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When writing this article, I asked him if he had renter\u2019s insurance in NYC. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know renters insurance in NYC existed at the time.\u201d In the perfect world, Sean would be an outlier. But the truth is, Sean is in the majority. Most young New Yorker\u2019s don\u2019t know about renters insurance in NYC, or if they do know about it, don\u2019t have it.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that\u2019s a big problem because a fire, burglary, flood or any other devastating event can happen at any moment, to anyone. You never expect them. You never think they can happen to you. They\u2019re always the types of events you look back on after they happen and say, \u201cI never thought it could happen to me.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The good news is, Sean learned his lesson.<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And I say that\u2019s good news because (and I\u2019m not lying here) the next apartment he moved into burned down, too.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m not going to share an image of that fire, but this seemingly impossible scenario actually happened. He left his first apartment because it burned down, only to move to another apartment that burned down. Absolutely insane and unpredictable. <\/span>However,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the second time he had renters insurance in NYC which covered his losses.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of people are people are living like old Sean, blissfully unaware of how important renter\u2019s insurance in NYC is until it\u2019s too late. But <\/span>it&#8217;s a good<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> opportunity <\/span>now <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to get ahead of the game and avoid being one of those people who say, \u201cI never thought this could happen to me.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems extreme, but that\u2019s exactly how Sean felt after uber-ing to his apartment when he got notified of the first fire, unable to get with 1,000 feet because the fire department had closed down the lock.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Don&#8217;t Be a Sean.
