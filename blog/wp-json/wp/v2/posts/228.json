Living with someone who&nbsp;is unlike you isn\u2019t&nbsp;just great for a compatible roommate relationship. (Finally that \u201copposites attract\u201d thing makes some sense.) But it\u2019s also an awesome way to learn more about yourself.&nbsp;Whether your roommate is a self-proclaimed extrovert or they have some obvious extroverted tendencies that don\u2019t quite match your more introverted ones, you can still find harmony at home. Here are some tips for co living with extrovert roommates to create and maintain a peaceful home environment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Understand extroversion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Extroverts&nbsp;are generally outgoing, enthusiastic, spontaneous and overtly expressive, says <a href=\"http:\/\/patrickwanis.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Patrick Wanis<\/a>, psychotherapist and human behavior expert. One of the tips for co living with an extrovert roommate is to better understand them. They usually break the ice when meeting people. And tend to have outward confidence \u2014 you can rightfully call them the \u201clife of the party.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the hallmark trait of an extrovert is their tendency to feel their best when surrounded by people. A complete opposite to their introverted counterparts, who regain energy in solitude.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>\u201cWe all need a certain amount of alone time to recuperate, regenerate and relax,&#8221;<\/em><\/strong> he says.<strong><em> &#8220;However, the extrovert is going to get a higher buzz and actually get more energy and become more empowered by being around lots of people.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same vein, social relationships are also very important to extroverts, says hypnotherapist and self-proclaimed extrovert, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/www.mindfulhypnoticconnections.com\/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1447693073114000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZbiCifOt2ycoz-t16KXksPWm_JA\">Lainie Naugle<\/a>.&nbsp;Surrounding herself with friends can be the perfect pick-me-up on a rough day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m feeling stressed or burnt out, something as small as catching up with a friend over lunch makes me feel a lot better,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause of this, social relationships are a high priority for me.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Extroversion is not absolute<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But one of the other important tips for co living with an extrovert roommate is that you shouldn\u2019t be so quick to assume they are going to be hosting parties every day.&nbsp;Extroversion falls on a scale, and an extrovert may sometimes feel more introverted. Wanis says there are different extroverted personalities. Namely, the \u201ctalker\u201d and the \u201cdoer.\u201d The talker seeks praise, while the doer seeks power. Talkers want to be the center of attention, are great storytellers and always have something to say. They also tend to make light of serious problems. Doers tend to be great leaders and love to tell people what to do and how to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Check your misconceptions about extroversion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While they may love to be the center of attention, one&nbsp;common misconception about extroverts is that they need <em>constant<\/em> attention. They aren\u2019t \u201con\u201d 24\/7 and also need some down time. So another one of the most important tips for co living with extrovert roommates is to check your misconceptions about them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even though&nbsp;extroverts exude confidence through their outgoing personalities, it\u2019s important to remember they\u2019re not immune to hurt feelings.&nbsp;Naugle admits it\u2019s a challenge not to take it personally when someone doesn\u2019t want to hang out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cBecause I prioritize social relationships over time for myself, I can get my feelings hurt when I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s reciprocated,\u201d Naugle says. \u201cI had to learn that people have different priorities, and that it\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another very common&nbsp;misconception about extroverts is that they can only get along with other extroverts, Wanis says. But while an extrovert roommate can get a \u201cbuzz\u201d from spending time with other extroverts, it can also be draining and lead to competition. In fact, it\u2019s one of the main reasons extroverts and introverts make great roommates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIf you put two highly extroverted people together, they\u2019re going to be competing for attention. One or both of them are going to want to be the boss,\u201d Wanis says.<\/p><p>\u201cHowever, a complementary relationship is when you have an extrovert and an introvert who complement each other because the extrovert now has an audience, and the introvert who likes to watch and think, can watch and analyze the extrovert.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"729\" data-attachment-id=\"11888\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/4-expert-tips-co-living-extrovert-roommate\/attachment\/extrovert-roommate\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/extrovert-roommate.jpeg?fit=1406%2C1001&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1406,1001\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"extrovert-roommate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/extrovert-roommate.jpeg?fit=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/extrovert-roommate.jpeg?fit=1024%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/extrovert-roommate.jpeg?resize=1024%2C729&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"extroverted friends \" class=\"wp-image-11888\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/extrovert-roommate.jpeg?resize=1024%2C729&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/extrovert-roommate.jpeg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/extrovert-roommate.jpeg?resize=768%2C547&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/extrovert-roommate.jpeg?w=1406&amp;ssl=1 1406w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Accept their different needs (And communicate yours)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one of the most important tips for co living with any roommate is respecting each other. And respecting your extroverted roommate means accepting that their needs may be different from yours. They might need to come home and tell you about their day. Then turn on the TV and invite friends over to unwind. So be a friend, and humor them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cAn extrovert might get mad and disappointed if you come home and you just close the door and don\u2019t talk and share.\u201d Wanis says.&nbsp;\u201cGive them some time and some attention. Hang out with them, ask them some questions, and show interest.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But while you\u2019re trying to be a good roommate, one of the most underrated tips for co living is that it\u2019s also totally OK (and recommended) to pay attention to your own needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re around when you need space, the best way thing to tell them is, \u2018I just need some time to myself right now, but let\u2019s grab a bite to eat later?\u2019\u201d Naugle suggests.<\/p><p>\u201cMaking it clear that you\u2019re OK with spending time together later lets them know that nothing is amiss in your relationship, as they can be very sensitive to social rejection.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And who knows, eventually you may find yourself rubbing off on each other and developing skills you never had before?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cExtroverts have the strength of communication,\u201d Naugle says. \u201cThey bring people together and they turn strangers into friends. They can become close friends with their roommates and bring them out of their shells. It adds warmth to the home.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Set clear boundaries <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one of the important tips for co living that will save any roommate relationship is to create boundaries. Even though they\u2019re talkers,&nbsp;extroverts also tend to beat around the bush when discussing something important, Naugle says. Something that could seriously get in the way of a co-living situation, unless you\u2019re upfront about having clear communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cWhen it comes to setting up basic house rules, it\u2019s best to have that conversation early on and to have it clearly written down where you both can see it,\u201d Naugle says. \u201cIt might not always help them keep up with their side of the chores, but it will keep you from arguing over what the expectations are.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Know that extrovert roommates who are doers will tend to dominate the home environment, which is fine if you can both agree. But the best thing to do, Wanis says, is to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/essential-clauses-for-a-roommate-agreement-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">make the rules<\/a> together so you get a say from the beginning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just think that problems are going to go away,\u201d Wanis says. \u201cIf you\u2019re dealing with an extrovert, they\u2019re going to tell you what they like and what they don\u2019t like. You must understand that, depending on which form of extroversion they have, they\u2019re going to want to dominate or they\u2019re going to want to be much louder than you.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Know your own likes and dislikes first<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Good communication requires knowing yourself as well. So before you say &#8216;My roommate is an extrovert so we&#8217;ll never get along,&#8217; do some self contemplation. If you have a quieter personality, be clear about what you don\u2019t like and also what you need and what you\u2019re willing to be flexible on. For example don\u2019t say, \u201cI don\u2019t like loud noise\u201d when you can say, \u201cI need peace and quiet,\u201d recommends Wanis. Then you can make the rules together based on your respective&nbsp;needs. For example, Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays might be \u201cno visitors days,\u201d while visitors are fine on other days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about understanding other people that leads to successful relationships; it\u2019s also about understanding yourself,\u201d Wanis says.<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, empathy and mutual respect are what holds every co-living relationship together, so avoid putting your needs first \u2014 regardless of where&nbsp;you fall on the introvert-extrovert scale. Either way, you should be ready to step back and make some compromises for the benefit of your relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cYes, your priority may be your social life, but you can\u2019t push your responsibilities aside at the expense of the person you live with,\u201d Naugle says.<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Live with an extrovert roommate?
