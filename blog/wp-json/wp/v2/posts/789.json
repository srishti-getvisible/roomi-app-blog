Sarah tried to find a roommate on Facebook and Craigslist, but couldn\u2019t find anyone she liked enough and ended up moving out at the end of the lease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Sarah it was frustrating, but for her landlord, it was maddening because that beautiful $4000 apartment sat empty for 3 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filling apartments is the endless hustle of NYC landlords. Almost nothing besides a catastrophe costs landlords more money than empty rooms. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the problems are only getting worse for landlords who don\u2019t act.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The market is changing, are you ready?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analysts at Ten-X Commercial predict that by the end of 2018, vacancy rates across the city could be as high as 11%. Even the savviest landlords will struggle to keep their apartments filled <\/span><b>if they keep doing what they\u2019ve been doing.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the number of vacancies is only a fraction of that, the loss will be massive. Just look at today. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to calculations by shared housing marketplace, Roomi, landlords are collectively <\/span><b>losing $199,021,129 per month due to vacant rooms, at a citywide vacancy rate of 3.45%<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If the worst case does come true, and vacancy rates rise to 11%, <\/span><b>within 12 months landlords will lose $634,560,121 per month.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><b>How to fill vacant rooms, fast<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what\u2019s a landlord to do? There\u2019s only so much you can change the rent on your listings, and there are only so many brokers you can get to fill your empty apartments. The most competitive market in the country is about to get 2-3x more competitive in a few months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Roomi, the answer is to avoid having to fill empty apartments in the first place. One of the biggest issues apartments end up vacant is because one roommate moves out and the remaining roommate(s) can\u2019t fill the apartment before their lease is up, so they end up moving.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roomi is a platform where individuals can open list empty rooms in their apartment, to access hundreds of thousands of people looking for a room. It solves the classic roommate matching problem in a way that is safe, secure and transparent. That\u2019s because Roomi offers background checks, social media verification, secure messaging and more to make people feel safe about who they\u2019re renting their room to or moving in with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For landlords, this solves the empty apartment problem in the most elegant way possible. <\/span><b>It fills empty rooms before they can even become empty apartments.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Their role in the process is minimal. All they have to do is get their tenants to list their empty rooms on Roomi, using marketing materials provided by Roomi, and Roomi takes care of the rest. For qualified landlords, Roomi even boosts their tenant listings, so they get seen ahead of the rest of the existing listings on the Roomi platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Here\u2019s what you need to do&#8230;<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a landlord looking to get ahead of the market, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can learn more about Roomi here<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the coming changes, few landlords have found an effective way to act. For most, Roomi is the solution to one of their most significant challenges. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about how Roomi is helping landlords fill their empty rooms: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sarah Parkins was living in her dream apartment with her best friend &#8211; a beautiful new two bedroom in the Lower East Side, in the middle of the action.
