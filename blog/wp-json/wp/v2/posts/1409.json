If you&#8217;re not exactly BFFs with your roomis, it can feel like a challenge to navigate this isolation period &#8211; especially when you have to implement novel social distancing measures in a place that feels smaller by the day.

Instead of texting your friends about how hard it is to adjust, or how you wish you were quarantining with them instead, it is time to be friends with your roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Play an ice-breaking game that urges you to confess one negative thing, followed by one positive thing about each other.

Wash your hands frequently and if you suspect you might be ill, wear a mask when you\u2019re around roommates. Don\u2019t leave a mess after cooking, bathing, or snacking on the couch. Get rid of expired stuff in your pantry and it wouldn&#8217;t hurt you to open a window from time-to-time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6.
