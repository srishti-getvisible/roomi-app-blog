Present-day Springfield was settled by European Americans in the late 1810s, around the time Illinois became a state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most famous historic resident of Springfield is Abraham Lincoln. He lived here from 1837 until 1861 when he went to the White House as President. So, some of the most popular tourist attractions you will find here are museums dedicated to the legacy of Abraham Lincoln.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, the city lies in a valley and plain near the Sangamon River. The weather in Springfield is also fairly typical for middle latitude locations. There are four distinct seasons, including hot summers and cold winters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/potential-roommate-questions-you-should-ask\/\">Questions You Need To Ask Your Potential Roommate Before Saying Yes<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Finding rooms for rent in Springfield, IL<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1014\" data-attachment-id=\"13813\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rooms-for-rent-in-springfield\/attachment\/screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11-55-48-pm\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11.55.48-PM.png?fit=1192%2C1180&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1192,1180\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11.55.48-PM\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11.55.48-PM.png?fit=300%2C297&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11.55.48-PM.png?fit=1024%2C1014&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11.55.48-PM.png?resize=1024%2C1014&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Roomi's listing map for rooms for rent in springfield \" class=\"wp-image-13813\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11.55.48-PM.png?resize=1024%2C1014&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11.55.48-PM.png?resize=300%2C297&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11.55.48-PM.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11.55.48-PM.png?resize=768%2C760&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Screenshot-2021-05-29-at-11.55.48-PM.png?w=1192&amp;ssl=1 1192w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link broken_link\" href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3fT6rlA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Find Rooms For Rent in Springfield, IL<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The main Springfield area is also based on a handy grid street system, with numbered streets starting with the longitudinal First Street. This part of the city leads to the Illinois State Capitol. Then further into 32nd Street in the far eastern part of the city. Before, the city had four distinct boundary streets. These included: North, South, East, and West Grand Avenues. Since the expansion, West Grand Avenue became MacArthur Boulevard. And then East Grand became 19th Street on the north side, and 18th Street on the south side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Springfield has at least twenty separately designated neighborhoods, though not all are incorporated with associations. Additionally, Springfield encompasses four different suburban villages that have their own municipal governments. They include Jerome, Leland Grove, Southern View, and Grandview.

Downtown&#8217;s close to restaurants and other fun activities. With a walk score of 77, it\u2019s the most walkable neighborhood in the city. While it does have a high walk score and a bike score of 44, most downtown residents claim it\u2019s still necessary to have a car. Interstate 55 runs north-south intersecting east-west highway 97 right in the middle of downtown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Old State Capitol building, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library, and Museum, and HSHS St. John\u2019s Hospital are downtown.

It was known as the \u201cJewel of Springfield,\u201d and was home to both wealthy and working-class alike. Even today, it\u2019s the most socio-economically and ethnically diverse neighborhood in Springfield. So, to find a room to rent in this part of town is fairly easy. You\u2019ll find many styles of early 19th century homes, some of which owners have beautifully restored. If you prefer to purchase a fixer-upper, some are still waiting for some TLC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Old Aristocracy Hill<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Springfield&#8217;s neighborhood is known for its active neighborhood association dedicated to maintaining a safe, beautiful and friendly place to live and work.

Old Aristocracy Hill lies just south of downtown, between Capitol Ave to South Grand and S Second to S Ninth. It has a healthy walk score of 62 and a bike score of 60.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The neighborhood is especially convenient if you work in downtown government administration or one of the large hospitals!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Average rent in Springfield, IL<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Springfield is infamous for having rental rates much below the national average.
