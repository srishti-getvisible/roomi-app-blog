Walking, traveling the subway, taking a bus or cab are the most common ways to move around in Manhattan, some still wish to have their private vehicles or use a different means.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Walkability <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p> Manhattan is the easiest city to travel by foot, and many pedestrians take advantage of this fact. There are many pre-packaged walking tours, some are free but most are very cheap. If you go out on your own, <a href=\"https:\/\/wikitravel.org\/en\/Manhattan\">counting on 20 blocks<\/a> equals a mile and taking 20 to 30 minutes to <a href=\"http:\/\/walk.It\">walk.It<\/a> is the easiest to navigate through when looking for rooms for rent in Manhattan<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Roads\/Traffic<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid traffic, tune in to local stations with traffic updates on the Morning radio. Avoid roads and areas with heavy construction. traveling in and out of Manhattan between 8-9 a.m. and 3-7 p.m. are the toughest. If you can, try to avoid rush hour or consider some alternate routes. Many areas are blocked off from traffic and street festivals which run through spring, summer, and fall close-off avenues. Visitors that rent or bring in their cars park it due to the stress that comes from struggling to park.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Taxis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than own a car, most Manhattans prefer to use a car service app because it\u2019s more convenient. Manhattan cabs are yellow. Cab fares are strictly by meter, it is essentially that you give a 10% to 15% tip. Also note that the responsibility for tolls are on you. The difference between an available taxi and off duty taxi is their lights, it\u2019s taxi sign light is on when available and dimmed when off duty and shift change. It\u2019s worthy of note that taxis can be inefficient during rush hour. Available <a href=\"https:\/\/www.timeout.com\/newyork\/things-to-do\/cheapest-car-services-in-nyc\">car service apps<\/a> are LYFT, UBER, GETT and VIA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Public transportation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The buses and rail system in Manhattan is run by the m<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nycgo.com\/plan-your-trip\/basic-information\/transportation-in-nyc\/getting-around\">etropolitan transportation authority<\/a>. There are 43 bus routes in Manhattan, 472 train stations, and 36 rail lines. Most buses are available until midnight to 5 am. Only a few run overnight. Bus rides cost $2.50<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Airport<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From Times Square, it\u2019ll take you about 30 minutes to get to JFK International Airport which is located in the borough of Queens approximately 19km southeast of Lower Manhattan. Traveling from Newark Liberty international is easier than journeying from JFK if your eventual destination is on the west side of Manhattan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Cycle Friendly<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p> If you want to cycle uninterrupted, the Harlem river greenway is your best bet, although a short route while the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway is a 31-mile bicycle route around the island of Manhattan. You can rent a bike for $9 in <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=cycling+in+manhattan&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-ng&amp;ei=A2p-YKO0FMSLlwTw9bz4Cw&amp;oq=cycling+in+manhattan&amp;gs_lcp=ChNtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1zZXJwEAMyBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgIIADIICAAQBxAFEB46BAgAEEc6BAghEAo6CggAEA0QBRAKEB5Q6NcDWPejBGCWpwRoAnABeACAAdQDiAHGNJIBCjAuMi4yMS4zLjGYAQCgAQHIAQjAAQE&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-serp#trex=m_t:lcl_akp,rc_f:rln,rc_ludocids:4122218259216734914,ru_lqi:ChRjeWNsaW5nIGluIG1hbmhhdHRhbki9h9TPzI-AgAhaKwoHY3ljbGluZxAAGAAYAiIUY3ljbGluZyBpbiBtYW5oYXR0YW4qBAgDEACSAQ1iaWN5Y2xlX3N0b3JlqgEPEAEqCyIHY3ljbGluZygA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Manhattan<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Weather In Manhattan<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>January is the coldest month in Manhattan at 32.6 \u00b0F (0.3 \u00b0C) which is the daily temperature.
