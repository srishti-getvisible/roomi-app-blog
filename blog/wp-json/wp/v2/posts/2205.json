Shared living in and itself comes with its own set of challenges, often unanticipated, even if it&#8217;s your fourth or fifth time renting.

This ecosystem exists on a very delicate line of stretched-out thread and you&#8217;re holding one end taut just like your roommate with the other end, capice?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does the word &#8216;soul-roommate&#8217; mean to you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We often carry with us the habits we form in our previous living situations to the new setting. The thing is, these habits might not always click with your new roommate. What might be a random bit you like indulging in, might just be a deal-breaker for the roommate you seek.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We advise creating an actual list of things you want from your <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/ways-to-make-a-new-roommate-feel-welcome-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new roommate<\/a>. Make this as personal as you can. If luck&#8217;s on your side, your roommate and you might just have multiple similar interests and needs. If that&#8217;s not the case, we recommend communicating your likes\/dislikes clearly and being equally willing to accommodate their likes\/dislikes too.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/wJOAGn2z78hDpHJxsM\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/wJOAGn2z78hDpHJxsM\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Flexibility and perfect roommates that go beyond yoga.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexibility in shared living can be a little more complicated than fixing a yoga routine together. What you seek is bound to conflict with what your roommate(s) want at some point or the other. From a simple furniture addition to more serious issues like smoking and fights with their better-halves you wish you didn&#8217;t witness &#8211; especially the night before an important exam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soul roommate or not, we recommend getting this out of the way first. The best solution to creating certain boundaries is to get creative with it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get together and create a fun roommate agreement! A piece of paper where each party notes down their deal breakers, boundaries, and compromise points. Make this a sacred document, one that might also serve as a great centerpiece on your living room wall!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/dJ0ldhAxDCtIK8Jaek\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/dJ0ldhAxDCtIK8Jaek\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A table for two, please!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A known trick to getting to know someone and see if you are a good match is to share a meal, in a public setting, with maybe a drink and a half. How people act in restaurants can be very insightful and often tell you things you might have otherwise failed to catch. Be on the lookout for those that seem too &#8220;good to be true&#8221; &#8211; chances are they probably are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/ideal-roommate-match-based-zodiac\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Related: Your Ideal Roommate match based On Your Zodiac<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inviting them to a casual hang\/party with your mates might also be a good bet if the person&#8217;s already moved in.
