You cannot run a business, at least not a successful one, if you don\u2019t learn how to manage finances well. That\u2019s how companies go bankrupt and are forced to dissolve. Of course, that\u2019s a risk you\u2019re taking every time you think of running a business. However, there are steps you can take to mitigate financial trouble and avoid that very outcome. Which is where financial <em>risk<\/em> management comes into play. We know, all these words are enough to induce anxiety, but don\u2019t worry!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-here-s-some-tangible-things-you-can-do-to-get-started-on-financial-risk-management\">Here\u2019s some tangible things you can do to get started on financial risk management-<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Identify any and all of your <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.eaglebusinesscredit.com\/blog\/understanding-credit-risk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">credit risks<\/a> as soon as you can. This way you\u2019re one step ahead of any potential disasters and can sidestep easily.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Avoid loans and unknown financiers as much as you can, this will really help you in the long run.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure you pay off your outstanding debts and balances in a timely manner.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure you have reliable payment records in place.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See, that\u2019s not so hard, is it?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/VZu1684nyKGiI\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/VZu1684nyKGiI\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-golden-rule-of-financial-risk-management-have-a-plan-b\">The golden rule of financial risk management: Have a Plan B<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know this sounds like a cop-out, but trust us, it\u2019s anything but! Having a backup plan is the sign of an entrepreneur who knows what they\u2019re doing. Think about it, would you want to work for someone whose ambition has given them tunnel vision or do you want a pragmatic leader who\u2019s thought of every possible outcome and prepared for the worst? Yeah, that\u2019s what we thought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/magazine\/202006\/bill-shapiro\/pivot-plan-b-failure-strategy-twitter-slack-youtube.html\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">plan B<\/a> truly saves your business when things start going south. And trust us, things will go south at some point, that\u2019s just how it is. But it\u2019s all about how you recuperate from those failures that will define your career. So, get thinking about your plan B!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:76%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3orifjbVypbk8eRLPO\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/3orifjbVypbk8eRLPO\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/our-founder\/expat-experience-makes-good-entrepreneurs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Why The Expat Experience Makes For Good Entrepreneurs<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-all-about-the-work-work-work-work-work\">It\u2019s all about the work, work, work, work, work!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now that you\u2019re an entrepreneur, you really should get comfy with doing market research and cuz that\u2019s your life now! Of course, when your business grows, you can get more and more people on-board to help you out here. But till then, this is your job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing your market research is such an important part of the job, we can\u2019t possibly stress this enough. How much impact your business has is directly related to how detailed your market research was. After all, a shocking <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/john-white\/most-businesses-fail-why-investing-in-the-right-id.html\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">percentage<\/a> of businesses fail because there just wasn\u2019t any demand for their product in the market. This market research will also help you come up with a solid and sustainable business plan. This, of course, directly helps with financial risk management and helps grow the business in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating data collected via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uniqode.com\/qr-code-generator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uniqode&#8217;s QR code generator<\/a> also enables smarter financial forecasting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-learn-how-to-weigh-the-odds\">Learn how to weigh the odds<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By now you can already gauge how much of being a young entrepreneur is just assessing risks. Risk assessment is of course not an exact science and no one can ever precisely predict the outcome of a business decision. However, you can certainly take calculated risks while minimizing losses. When you\u2019re starting out it can be hard to know instinctively which risks are important and which ones can be pushed aside for a while. This is where a simple pen and paper will help. Write down all the possible risks and their outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have all the information, it\u2019s easy to assess which ones are important and have to be dealt with immediately and which ones can be left in the back burner for a while. That\u2019s how you come up with a proper strategy to be fully prepared. And that\u2019s essentially what financial risk management is all about. Having a good strategy and exit plan to deal with any financial fallout in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:89%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/tZCkL6BsL2AAo\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/tZCkL6BsL2AAo\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>There you have it, now you know the basics of risk management.
