Here\u2019s what experts say about finding affordable apartments for rent in Seattle and locking them down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apartments for Rent in Seattle: 101<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/hateplow-sky-timelapse-washington-v4UgKClFVQFdC\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.giphy.com\/media\/v4UgKClFVQFdC\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C320&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Timelapse Space Needle GIF by hateplow - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rent Control and Rent Stabilization<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rent control is a strict regulation of rent, and it\u2019s a rare and precious thing for few cities. It\u2019s impossible to rent a rent-controlled apartment now. Because once the original tenant vacates it, the unit most often becomes rent-stabilized. Rent stabilization controls rent in a manageable way for both renters and landlords. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This usually applies to buildings built during a certain time period (1947 to 1974 in NYC, for example). Moreover, relies on the state of the&nbsp;local economy and inflation to regulate the allowable percentage increase on rent. This allows landlords to increase rent to keep up with the market without doubling to tripling it overnight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds great for renters, right? Well, it\u2019s also a highly controversial issue, especially in Washington, where the politicians are split on the subject. Many believe it wouldn\u2019t make a difference in making apartments for rent in Seattle more affordable and that rent control is a \u201cfailed economic policy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" data-attachment-id=\"12506\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/where-to-find-affordable-apartments-for-rent-in-seattle\/attachment\/rent-in-seattle-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1251&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1251\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rent-in-seattle\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle.jpeg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle.jpeg?resize=1024%2C681&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"night view of the apartments to rent in seattle\" class=\"wp-image-12506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle.jpeg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle.jpeg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1022&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1043&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rooms-for-rent-in-seattle\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Find Rooms for Rent in Seattle<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What experts say<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Chuck Hattemer, CMO and co-founder of OneRent.co, says that while rent control might look good on paper, it poses new challenges for property owners and renters alike in notoriously rent-controlled areas <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/tips-travel-get-around-san-francisco-like-pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">like San Francisco<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThe primary issue we see is that owners of rent-controlled units have little to no incentive to perform maintenance or upgrades on their units on a regular basis,\u201d he explains, comparing current events in San Francisco to a hypothetical rent-controlled future for Seattle.<\/p><p>\u201cMaintenance costs are unregulated, and therefore the numbers just don\u2019t make sense if you wanted to invest $5,000 into renovations but can only raise the rent 1.6 percent and earn an additional $200 a year or something along those lines.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Seattle rents drop amid COVID-19 pandemic as apartment incentives increase\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ve0QUSDezcY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hattemer argues that the lack of rent regulations in Seattle is a more beneficial system, allowing investors to renovate old or undesirable buildings to market levels, and charge the standard rent.

A Slippery Slope. So where does that leave renters? On a slippery slope, to say the least. Though the lack of rent control essentially frees up the housing stock, it doesn\u2019t help in a tight rental market. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/renting-an-apartment-in-a-pandemic-roomi\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Guide To Renting An Apartment After School: The Pandemic Edition<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overview of rent control in Seattle <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Seth Stephens, a professional landlord at Renters Warehouse of Seattle, there is a lot to consider when you hit the local rental market \u2014 the first being a shortage of supply.\u201c The biggest hurdle facing the Seattle area is lack of homes on the market and the cost of them,\u201d he says. \u201cA quality home is being rented in a matter of hours or days with multiple applications, making it tough for tenants to find that perfect home.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/the-panozzo-team-thepanozzoteam-thepanozzos-the-panozzos-U6v5T7a8dsSSNn79Jv\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media4.giphy.com\/media\/U6v5T7a8dsSSNn79Jv\/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Uh Huh Writing GIF by thepanozzoteam - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not surprising, considering the vacancy rate in the area can vary from as high as 4.6 percent to as low as 1.4 percent, depending on the neck of the woods you\u2019re renting in. And availability is just one of the issues.\u201c The average two-bedroom rent in Seattle is $2,400 monthly,\u201d Stephens continues. \u201cAs you get into the surrounding areas, you see those prices drop, but it\u2019s still not exactly affordable.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/apartment-rental-fees-can-landlord-legally-charge\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>What Apartment Rental Fees Can My Landlord Legally Charge Me?<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Deeper insights on rent in Seattle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the reasons local renters have been crying out for the return of rent control in the last few years. In a market based on inflation and government-regulated control, the rent might be more adaptable, and so would the renters. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it stands, Stephens says that owners have had to catch up to the market, and tenants looking for apartments for rent in Seattle may very well be suffering because of it.\u201c We\u2019re seeing many owners who have had tenants for three to four years and have no idea the market is up $300 to $800 monthly,\u201d he explains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"What $1,000 A Month Gets You In Seattle\" width=\"1250\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qLPQHhawxCw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering a month-to-month tenant must only be given a 30-day-notice before a landlord can raise the&nbsp;rent, it\u2019s important to know a few key things about apartments for rent in Seattle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Negotiating, Communicating, and Rooming Up<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering what\u2019s a renter to do in a no-rent-control-high-demand-low-supply market, don\u2019t worry \u2014 you\u2019re not alone. Here are some great tips to navigate the rental market in Seattle (or anywhere, for that matter).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1.&nbsp;Sign a Longer Lease<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tenantsunion.org\/en\/rights\/rule-changes-rent-increases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">Washington Tenants Union<\/a>, in apartments for rent in Seattle, a landlord cannot change any aspect of a lease during the fixed-term period except by mutual agreement. So the longer your lease term, the longer you can hold onto a great deal. In many cases, landlords prefer tenants who are willing to sign longer leases because it offers them security as well. (More on that in the next section.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to really find a great deal? It\u2019s all about getting in early, says Hattemer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to look in areas that are still developing and on the up-and-up. This will mean that you can lock down a long-term lease in an area that is going to have lots of new development, job opportunities, new restaurants, new things to do, new public transportation, and more.<\/p><p>\u201cTo rent in Seattle specifically, look at neighborhoods such as North Queen Anne, Magnolia, or West Seattle.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Negotiate With Your Landlord<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this is totally allowed and <em>always<\/em> recommended. Apartment prices aren\u2019t fixed, and you may be surprised at your bargaining power. Negotiate the rent&nbsp;before you sign a new lease. And before you resign an old lease, keeping in mind your strong suits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" data-attachment-id=\"12508\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/where-to-find-affordable-apartments-for-rent-in-seattle\/attachment\/rent-in-seattle-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-1.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1255&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1255\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rent-in-seattle-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-1.jpeg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"talking to landlord in your apartment for rent in seattle\" class=\"wp-image-12508\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-1.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1047&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-1.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cTenants who have low-debt-to-income levels, stable jobs, and good credit are still the ideal tenants for an owner.

If you can do a longer term lease, this will allow an owner to justify dropping the rent or being open to certain terms a tenant might want.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that landlords aren\u2019t picky just for any reason.

And thus the owner is financially motivated,\u201d adds Hattemer, who also reccommends offering additional incentives deposits for pets.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Communicate With Your Landlord<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To rent in Seattle alone isn&#8217;t enough. Remember when we said landlords are human, too? Keep that in mind when trying to build a good repertoire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cA landlord has two major concerns. They want rent paid on time and their home to be taken care of\u201d Stephens continues. \u201cIf you can accomplish these two things, you can keep an affordable home. And also have a good relationship with the landlord.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And to ensure timely maintenance and a well-kept residence, it\u2019s vital to keep your landlord up to speed about any issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" data-attachment-id=\"12509\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/where-to-find-affordable-apartments-for-rent-in-seattle\/attachment\/rent-in-seattle-2-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-2.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1255&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1880,1255\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rent-in-seattle-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-2.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-2.jpeg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"bedroom interior\" class=\"wp-image-12509\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-2.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-2.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1047&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/rent-in-seattle-2.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cLandlords appreciate tenants that are proactive, flexible, and patient,\u201d adds Hattemer.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.
