Some personality clashes are normal and expected when two (or more) people live together, but this is becoming much worse. Whether they make a mess of the shared washroom, leave dirty dishes all over the place, or have no sense of boundaries &#8211; whatever the case may be, a stressful roommate can ruin your home environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your home should be a place <em>away<\/em> from all the stress, not be the source of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you do when kicking them out or moving isn&#8217;t an option? Ignore them? Not possible. They&#8217;re too irritating to ignore!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what else can you do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some things you can try to reach a common ground and co-habit a little more peacefully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get out of the house <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your roommate makes living in your house miserable, then sometimes it\u2019s a good idea to just take a break from the house itself. Getting out of the house is always good for your health, but it\u2019s essential for your well-being (especially if your roommate is an insufferable monster!). Take a walk in the park, join some classes, go to a cafe &#8211; have some &#8216;me time&#8217;. This will help to clear your mind and you&#8217;ll come home re-energised.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/cPZezAmszThfVRyurh\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/cPZezAmszThfVRyurh\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-caption gallery-caption\">Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GIPHY<\/a><\/figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Confront the issues head-on with your stressful roommate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to make a terrible living situation better is by communicating your feelings. If you or your housemate struggle with confrontation, just remember, it doesn&#8217;t have to be so difficult! It\u2019s just two adults communicating their concerns with each other. Try your best not to be rude to your roommates and listen to what they&#8217;re saying so that you can reach a middle ground without too much hassle. Be kind and talk to them like an adult &#8211; you\u2019ll find that it&#8217;s a lot less awkward than it seems.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/RfeBpOZy0y1rhnl3sT\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/RfeBpOZy0y1rhnl3sT\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Give your stressed out roommate Some Space<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone with siblings will tell you that living with someone 24\/7 can make them a hundred times more annoying than they really are. Every little thing will start to get on your nerves- the way they chew, the way they talk, the way they laugh &#8211; and living with a someone that you already find irritating only makes this worse! Try and give each other some space, set a time where you don\u2019t disturb each other, or rather, don\u2019t interact with each other. Time apart can really do wonders for people. As the saying goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:85%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l0CRCPXURKX7lyU48\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l0CRCPXURKX7lyU48\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-caption gallery-caption\">Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GIPHY<\/a><\/figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vent about that stressful person (with someone else!)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes all you need is to vent. Instead of yelling at your stressful roommate or letting everything fester inside you, turn to a confidant. A friend, sibling, or parent can really help in a situation like this. It\u2019s okay if they don\u2019t have a solution for you, but it might actually be better if they don\u2019t try to give you all the answers. Sometimes all you need is for someone to listen to your rant and show support.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/UsTh3kCkLLLnn1UZUg\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/UsTh3kCkLLLnn1UZUg\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-caption gallery-caption\">Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GIPHY<\/a><\/figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Find a mediator<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have exhausted all other options, then you\u2019re left with no other choice than to call for backup. If you are a college\/university student, you can get the help of the campus mediators who can sit you both down and get to the root of the problem. Outside intervention can really put things in perspective for both of you and perhaps help you see the other\u2019s point of view. If you\u2019re not a college student, this might be a bit more tricky. Setting up an intervention can help in extreme cases, especially with stressful people. Get some of your mutual friends or acquaintances to help you out by setting up an intervention. But be careful, don\u2019t gang up on your roommate. You want to create a safe environment where everyone can communicate openly.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:54%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/Xg9qVfblOUg5oMBS1v\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/Xg9qVfblOUg5oMBS1v\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-caption gallery-caption\">Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GIPHY<\/a><\/figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers with advice to tackle stressful people?
