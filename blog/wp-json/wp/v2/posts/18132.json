When finding rooms for rent, there are many apps and websites just waiting for you on your phone or laptop. Despite that, not all room finders are as reliable as we&#8217;d like, so how can we know which one has the best features and offers the best price? Don&#8217;t fret! In this article, we&#8217;ll discuss everything room finder-related to help you in your journey in moving to a new city. Read on to see the comparison of Roomrs and Roomi, the Roomrs alternative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/bungalow-alternative-choose-best-room-finder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roomi vs Bungalow: Which is the Best Portal to Find Rooms for Rent?<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room\">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/MXpVk1PmdSvAmNjvUg\" title=\"filters\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Before using (or paying for) any application, we want to check whether its features are right for us. The same applies to room finder apps or websites when you&#8217;re apartment hunting, so we&#8217;ve listed a few of the most essential features that can make your room-finding experience much more manageable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"no-fee-apartments\">No fee apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Roomi the best room finder is their no fee listings. &#8220;No fee&#8221; means there aren&#8217;t any added charges by the app or website when you log in, plus no broker&#8217;s fee or surprises further down the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrastingly, many Roomrs reviews report having paid a lot of hidden and arbitrary fees when using the room finder. There are fees to contact a landlord, become a Roomrs member, book a viewing, and an additional fee to cover the cost of the initial application and background check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pet-friendly-apartments\">Pet-Friendly Apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When apartment hunting, you might find that many landlords turn away potential tenants when there&#8217;s a pet involved. Roomi recognizes this problem, so they&#8217;ve made pet-friendly features available to help you narrow down your search and find a room that fits both you and your pet. Simply select the appropriate filter while searching for listings, and this Roomrs alternative will do the rest. Roomrs also has listings that permit pets, but they have a strict no-pet rule for units with more than one bedroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subletting\">Subletting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both room finders have subletting features available to their users. They also conduct background checks to make sure that your potential roommate is someone you can trust. However, in Roomrs, there&#8217;s no guarantee of who your potential roommate(s) will be; you&#8217;ll only be given their gender, age, and occupation. You also don&#8217;t have the option to message them beforehand, so you&#8217;ll only really get to know your roomie once you meet them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Roomrs alternative, Roomi has secure in-app messaging so you can talk to your potential roomie safely and freely, before you make any commitments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities\">Filtering rooms based on amenities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot to consider when finding rooms for rent and a crucial one is the list of amenities available in the property. So, Roomi and Roomrs have made filtering based on amenities possible for their users. Just choose everything that fits your needs (from an in-unit washer or even a doorman!) for all the appropriate listings to appear. One thing to note is that Roomrs doesn&#8217;t provide a list of included furnishings in their apartments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms\">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type (entire place\/shared rooms)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you want to live on your own or with others, you can find apartments based on listing type in Roomi and Roomrs. Roomi does go one step further, giving you the option to look at more specific listings with their shared room, private room, and entire place filters. On Roomrs, there are only two options: shared or private.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules\">Filtering rooms based on House Rules<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many websites like Roomrs don&#8217;t include house rules as part of their filtering, making looking for rooms difficult when you want to get specific. Thankfully with Roomi&#8217;s extensive filters, you can choose to have no smoking and drinking as a rule in the apartment, as well as rules about couples, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/faq\/how-to-search-for-rooms-that-allow-couples\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to search for rooms that allow couples<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features\">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3ohhwKRT1iDiCsatAA\" title=\"cost\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"allowing-free-listings\">Allowing Free Listings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roomi wants its users to have a hassle-free experience in searching for rooms, so browsing for listings is free in the app and website. Although you can get more out of the room finder with a <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.freshdesk.com\/en\/support\/solutions\/articles\/44002274316-what-is-included-in-my-subscription-\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roomi Gold subscription<\/a> for only $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week. By being a Roomi Gold member, you can have a Fully Verified badge on your profile and get your listings boosted by 7x! You&#8217;ll also have access to unlimited messages, five active listings, and free bookings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, you&#8217;d have to pay an enrollment fee to gain access to all listings and be able to message a potential landlord in Roomr. On top of that, when booking a room, all members must pay a security deposit and an additional $125 membership fee per month plus rent. They also have a utility cap wherein if the apartment exceeds the limit, the overage should be divided and paid by you and your roommates. Additionally, Roomrs members can incur a &#8216;Flex Fee&#8217; depending on the length of the lease ($125\/month for 3-5 months and $75\/month for 6-7 months).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-app-messaging\">In-app messaging<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Roomrs alternative, Roomi offers its users a free and secure in-app messaging feature, all-in-one! Messaging a potential roommate or landlord is smooth and easy with Roomi, plus you have nothing to worry about because all communication inside the app is kept safe and secure. For Roomrs, you can only request a call with their support team, and for listings, you only get to contact a potential landlord or roommate once you pay and become a member.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible\">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/b1xWNiJdfzdOiKNZdm\" title=\"safety\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Safety and security are top priorities when using any kind of app or website. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to go through everything before giving away any of your private information. Roomi takes all preemptive measures to secure their services and protect their users further. For one, the Roomrs alternative verifies their users by asking them to provide a copy of their lease, utility bill, or any government-issued ID. Once complete, they&#8217;ll be able to show a verified badge on their profile. On top of that, your exact listing address isn&#8217;t available to other Roomi users, and only an approximate location is shown. As a bonus, Roomi has a Support and Content Moderation team available 24\/7 that picks out bad listings and can cater to any concerns you might have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, Roomrs doesn&#8217;t show the exact location of any listing and has its own support team. Yet, according to some Roomrs reviews, the room finder has unresponsive customer service, and many users report having a bad experience regarding the app&#8217;s response to concerns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Related<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/faq\/can-i-list-multiple-rooms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Can I list multiple rooms?<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you\">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many room finders are available to use, but not all are worth your time and money.

With their no fee listings, a wide variety of search options, incomparable features, and fair prices, you can expect to find the best apartment for you by using the Roomrs alternative!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"has-white-background-color has-background-dim-100 wp-block-cover__gradient-background has-background-dim\"><\/span><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignfull is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"5969\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/shared-apps\/attachment\/roomi-app\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=1600%2C1066&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1066\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Roomi-App\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Roomi-App-best roommate finder\" class=\"wp-image-5969 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-large-font-size\"><strong>Roomi is your one-stop option to list or find rooms, find roommates to settle into a new city easily.
