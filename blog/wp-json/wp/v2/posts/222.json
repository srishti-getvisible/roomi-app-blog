And while that requires some level of compromise and patience, it will ultimately benefit your self-growth.&nbsp;So if you find yourself living with an introvert roommate (and you\u2019re quite the opposite), don\u2019t worry! You can still have a great roommate relationship. We talked to a few experts on how you can get off on the right foot when living with an introvert roommate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Understand introversion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People often hear \u201cintrovert\u201d and think of a loner or homebody. But it actually describes someone who is receptive to energy, says Nancy Tavares-Jones, registered psychotherapist and identity expert at Life Pathways Psychotherapy in Toronto.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cExtroverts prefer to surround themselves with lots of people and obtain their energy from them,\u201d Tavares-Jones says. \u201cIntroverts, on the other hand, prefer to obtain their energy from within. So, after a very long work week, an extrovert would prefer to go out and decompress with lots of people. Whereas an introvert roommate would prefer to recharge solo or with a partner or two, very low-key.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more is introversion isn\u2019t black and white, and there\u2019s no such thing as being a pure introvert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cThere are more introverted people, and those people will be more within themselves and will not necessarily enjoy spending a lot of time externally, and it\u2019s the same on the flip side as well,\u201d Tavares-Jones says.&nbsp;\u201cYou can have very social introverts and very shy extroverts,\u201d Tavarez-Jones says.<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Don\u2019t think your introvert roommate is \u2018anti-social\u2019 or \u2018shy\u2019<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because your introvert roommate doesn\u2019t exude energy does not mean they don\u2019t enjoy company. Rather, introverts prefer having deep, meaningful relationships with only a few people.&nbsp;So if your roommate goes straight to their room at the end of the day,&nbsp;it\u2019s not necessarily indicative of how they feel about you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/som.org\/board-of-directors\/laurel-clark-d-m-d-d\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Laurel Clark<\/a>, resident emeritus of the School of Metaphysics describes herself as an introvert. And she agrees that introverts do like social interaction. But their preference for intimate relationships can be misconstrued as being stand-offish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cJust because someone is an introvert, it doesn\u2019t mean that they want to be alone all the time,\u201d Clark says. \u201cThey usually are very good with one-on-one communication and can be good conversationalists. They just oftentimes have a hard time making small talk.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In an age when people are often encouraged to go out, socialize and make new friends, it can be difficult for your introvert roommate to be themselves, Tavares-Jones says. Being with other people is simply taxing for them, she stresses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand that they\u2019re not being <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">antisocial<\/a>,\u201d Tavares-Jones says. \u201cIt\u2019s how they regain energy.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"778\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"11906\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/4-expert-tips-co-living-introvert-roommate\/attachment\/introvert-roommate-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?fit=1580%2C2079&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1580,2079\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"introvert-roommate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?fit=228%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?fit=778%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?resize=778%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A boy sitting alone with his camera on the edge of a pink and white wall \" class=\"wp-image-11906\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?resize=778%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 778w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?resize=228%2C300&amp;ssl=1 228w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?resize=768%2C1011&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?resize=1167%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1167w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?resize=1556%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1556w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?resize=1568%2C2063&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/introvert-roommate.jpeg?w=1580&amp;ssl=1 1580w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Respect the difference between you and your introvert roommate <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether your roommate tells you they\u2019re an introvert, or you make an educated assumption based on their everyday behavior, the first step to maintaining a healthy relationship is simply accepting the differences in your personalities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to feel sorry for them,\u201d Tavares-Jones advises. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to feel upset for them. That\u2019s just how they prefer to spend their energy.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Introversion isn\u2019t a good or bad thing; it\u2019s just a set of preferences that need to be respected. This respect, Tavares-Jones stresses, is one of the key things to a happy home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of respect is keeping in mind how your behavior affects your roommate. Having lived with both extroverts and introverts, Clark says she\u2019s noticed that extroverts sometimes don\u2019t realize how loud they are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cLiving with an extrovert who\u2019s not sensitive to the fact that they talk out loud might interfere with an introvert\u2019s think space, and that can be a challenge,\u201d Clark says.<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re living with an introvert roommate, Clark suggests getting to know their habits and when their preferred quiet times are. Excessive noise or late-night parties at home could be upsetting. You may have a large social network, but inviting over people your roommate doesn\u2019t know without getting a clear OK could very easily seem disrespectful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Communicate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like with any healthy relationship, communication is key when living with an introvert roommate. Make sure you take the time to hear your roommate\u2019s concerns. Introverts may not speak much, but they still have something to say. Even if they\u2019re not the best at expressing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cYour introvert roommate will often keep their energy to themselves, so because they don\u2019t share what their thoughts are, you really have to keep in mind that just because they\u2019re not sharing, it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have their opinion on how the house is run,\u201d Tavares-Jones says.<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Clark says that it took her time to practice communicating her needs to her roommates. But doing so created greater awareness of each other\u2019s needs and encouraged sensitivity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cWhat I learned in the process is that, oftentimes, I was expecting the extrovert to know what I was thinking and they didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for me to say what my thoughts are and not just expect somebody to read my mind,\u201d Clark says.<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tavares-Jones also suggests asking the introvert roommate to offer their own input on how to create a healthy, happy environment. And remember, patience is key!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t have an answer, let them think about it and process it and let them come back to you. Introverts oftentimes need some time to mull things over. Whereas extroverts think out loud on the spot and that can sometimes throw introverts off as well.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers live with an introvert roommate?
