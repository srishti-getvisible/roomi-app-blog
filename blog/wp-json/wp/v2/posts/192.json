But when you have to share a space with someone, it\u2019s vital to find a way to get along. Even if that means looking past the stack of dirty dishes&nbsp;or overflowing garbage can. But when the little stuff becomes too much to handle for one party, it can create palpable tension that can quickly turn toxic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good communication is the key to a healthy roommate relationship, but if you\u2019re getting bad vibes without a clear reason why, you might have a serious issue on your hands.&nbsp;We talked to an expert on common behaviors of a passive-aggressive roommate and how to deal if you\u2019re living with one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-passive-aggression\">What is Passive Aggression?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Psychology professor and clinical psychologist&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/psychology.nova.edu\/faculty\/profile\/dorfman.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. William Dorfman<\/a>&nbsp;defines passive-aggressive behavior as a dishonest expression of anger and hostility \u2014 an indirect expression of feelings people don\u2019t want to confront. The most serious implication of this behavior is that doesn\u2019t directly solve problems but rather expresses resentment&nbsp;and disapproval, making it difficult to deal with or improve a situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-are-the-signs-of-a-passive-aggressive-roommate\">What are the Signs of a Passive-Aggressive Roommate?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thirty-year-old blogger, Chloe, who prefers not to use her real name, knows what this feels like. She and a friend lived with a passive-aggressive roommate in a townhouse during her freshman year of college. She says their&nbsp;roommate regularly passive-aggressively found ways to be inconsiderate. Eventually, the situation escalated to the point they felt uncomfortable in their own home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>\u201cHe would leave messes, and we would have to clean up after him, but then he would complain about me to the third roommate or about her to me,\u201d says. \u201cIt became very uncomfortable because we would end up just trying to avoid him to keep the peace. It was like the tension became our fourth roommate. It was this real thing that was always present. You aren\u2019t home without comfort and feeling protected and safe. When that is stripped from you, you avoid home until it\u2019s late. You have no peace, no comfort.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While anyone can react to a difficult situation passive-aggressively, Dorfman says some consistent behaviors indicate it\u2019s not&nbsp;someone simply blowing off steam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>\u201cIt\u2019s inherently an interpersonal process and a personality trait.&nbsp;Sometimes, we even diagnose it in clinical psychology as a passive-aggressive personality disorder when it really characterizes a person, not just once in a while.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To add, here are some common passive-aggressive behaviors that your roommate might exhibit along with strategies for dealing with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-procrastination-on-chores\">1. Procrastination on chores<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter how many times you ask your roommate to do something, they\u2019ll make excuses until it becomes obvious that they\u2019re not happy. They might&nbsp;say they\u2019re going to do the dishes after you ask, but it never happens. Repetitive procrastination&nbsp;is likely an indication of not wanting to do something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dorfman says,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>\u201cWe all procrastinate, but when you procrastinate with someone else, it affects the other person\u2019s rights and they\u2019re left with the problem.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-being-forgetful-and-late\">2. Being forgetful and late<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A passive-aggressive roommate consciously or unconsciously forgets what\u2019s asked of them, or is constantly late. Lateness, according to Dorfman, is another way of saying &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take control of the situation.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you may ask your roommate to arrive home by a certain time so you can rest, but they\u2019ll be late and say they forgot your request. Or they may forget that you asked them not to eat your food in the fridge. When your roommate makes it a habit&nbsp;to be inconsiderate, it can be a sure sign of passive aggressiveness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-silent-treatment\">3. Silent treatment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A passive-aggressive roommate may also shut down when faced with conflict. Instead of talking about the issue, they express neither hostility nor honesty. Rather than negotiating to solve an uncomfortable situation, they give you the silent treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not talking, Chloe says, was one of the main issues in her roommate relationship. Looking back now, she says she\u2019s more aware of what to look for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>\u201cThe person will either say nothing was wrong or lash out. Either way, I would try to bring a peaceful and calm environment to whatever forum you decide to have and just keep having communication lines open.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-actions-don-t-match-the-attitude\">4. Actions don&#8217;t match the attitude<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most toxic passive-aggressive behavior is acting one way and feeling another. They come across as being insincere or \u201cfake nice\u201d. For example, your roommate might ask you to \u201cpick up\u201d some toilet paper from the store, but it eventually becomes a routine.&nbsp;Dorfman likens the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/coliving-101-help-my-roommate-talks-behind-my-back-roomi\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">situation<\/a>&nbsp;to someone stabbing you in the back while smiling to your face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>\u201cOften people who are passive-aggressive have an obvious, gratuitous attitude toward you that is not consistent with the way they act,\u201d Dorfman says. \u201cIf you\u2019re smiling at someone and being very sweet and friendly, how can you be angry?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-your-roommate-doesn-t-have-a-good-reason-to-be-angry\">5. Your roommate doesn\u2019t have a good reason to be angry<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every passive-aggressive roommate necessarily procrastinates or is stubborn and manipulative. The root of the behaviors of your roommate could also be that they don\u2019t like being limited by others. Before jumping to conclusions, you should consider this first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>\u201cIf you\u2019re not doing anything to instill or create any frustration or resentment, they don\u2019t need to act in a passive-aggressive way,\u201d Dorfman says. \u201cIt\u2019s only when they\u2019re called upon to do something or they\u2019re not getting their way. Rather than address that they\u2019re frustrated, they shut down and become stubborn, quiet, and withdrawn.<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>\u201cThey keep on saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to do it\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 and yet you continue to feel resentful about them. So, when your feelings don\u2019t match up and you\u2019re left confused about how you should deal with this person, that\u2019s one indication that it\u2019s not necessarily you. You\u2019re getting mixed messages from this person.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-6-backhanded-compliments\">6. Backhanded compliments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Backhanded compliments are comments or expressions that seem positive at first, but it&#8217;s actually an insult. These are also known as &#8220;non-compliments&#8221; or &#8220;disguised insults&#8221; as backhanded compliments are usually indirect and subtle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples of backhanded compliments are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>When you get a new haircut and your roommate says, &#8220;your haircut makes your nose look smaller.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You&#8217;re going out for the night and they say, &#8220;that&#8217;s a beautiful dress on you. I didn&#8217;t even realize it was you at first glance.&#8221;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>When your roommate comments on how your room or personal space looks: &#8220;I wish I was as relaxed as you in this mess.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-7-being-sarcastic\">7. Being sarcastic<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a sarcastic roommate can be tiresome if it gets too much. It&#8217;s similar to backhanded compliments in a way that both are verbal and indirect, but sarcastic comments are a bit more upfront than backhanded compliments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, sarcasm is usually with irony or mockery that can be hurtful, especially with roommates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-8-slamming-doors-intentionally\">8. Slamming doors intentionally<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another sign of having a passive-aggressive roommate is when they slam the doors to your apartment intentionally. For example, you had an argument, you told them off, or confronted them on something they did, then they suddenly leave the apartment then slam the door on their way out. It&#8217;s disrespectful and can disturb others living the apartment or even on the same floor, as the noise of the door slamming travels through the hallway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-deal-with-a-passive-aggressive-roommate-tips-amp-tricks\">How to Deal with a Passive-Aggressive Roommate: Tips &amp; Tricks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s normal to feel angry when <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/rules-to-set-in-apartments-for-rent-with-roommates\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dealing<\/a> with the behaviors of a passive-aggressive roommate. But the thing to keep in mind with passive-aggressive roommates is, you can&#8217;t change them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>\u201c[You] can get them to stop eating their food a lot easier than they can get them to become more open with their anger and more responsible with their feelings,\u201d Dorfman says. \u201cYou deal with the specific situation, not with the personality.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As per Dorfman, some solutions to dealing with a passive-aggressive roommate are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Tell your roommate you&#8217;re frustrated, ask them what&#8217;s going on, and discuss your concerns with them. But you should also be prepared for them to get defensive and shut down.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Talk to someone you trust who can see the situation objectively to get their perspective.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Try going to therapy or counseling to work things out if both are willing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the solutions depend on how volatile the behaviors of your roommate are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>\u201cPassive-aggressive style is on a continuum; it\u2019s not all or nothing. Certain people are more passive-aggressive than others, so I wouldn\u2019t count anyone out who has a particular difficulty with someone,\u201d Dorfman says. \u201cYou have to make the effort to try to resolve the issues and call somebody on what\u2019s going on.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-solution-to-dealing-with-passive-aggressive-roommates\">The Solution to Dealing with Passive-Aggressive Roommates<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding new roommates may be the solution to dealing with a passive-aggressive roommate. By seeking out individuals who are more communicative and considerate, you can create a more positive and harmonious living environment. Don&#8217;t let one negative experience discourage you from finding roommates who will bring joy and positivity to your home.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"499\" data-attachment-id=\"21008\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/finding-no-fee-apartments-in-new-york-city\/attachment\/roomi-4\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi.png?fit=2430%2C1183&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2430,1183\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Roomi\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi.png?fit=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi.png?fit=1024%2C499&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi.png?resize=1024%2C499&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Roomi\" class=\"wp-image-21008\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi.png?resize=1024%2C499&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi.png?resize=768%2C374&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi.png?resize=1536%2C748&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi.png?resize=2048%2C997&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi.png?resize=1250%2C609&amp;ssl=1 1250w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Roomi<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what <a href=\"https:\/\/roomiapp.com\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Roomi<\/a> is for.
