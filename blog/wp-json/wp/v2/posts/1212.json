The <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/finance\/benefits\/benefits-for-tenants.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NYC Rent Freeze Program<\/a> will bring forward talks to freeze or roll-back rent for the city\u2019s one million rent-stabilized units. As with everything new that 2020 has thrown at us, you\u2019ve probably got questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-stimulus-package-for-nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Everything You Need To Know About The Stimulus Package For NYC<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve gathered some Q and As on the key things you need to know about the rent freeze in NYC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-the-nyc-rent-freeze-program-all-about\">What is the NYC Rent Freeze Program all about?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/nyc-resources\/freeze-your-rent.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NYC Rent Freeze Program<\/a> was actually introduced back in 2016 for people living in rent-regulated properties in NYC. It stops rent increases on one-year and two-year lease renewals. The program helps eligible seniors or those with disabilities stay in affordable housing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the Rent Guidelines Board has engaged in <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/ny.curbed.com\/2020\/5\/8\/21250970\/rent-guidelines-board-nyc-preliminary-vote-rent-freeze\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">preliminary conversations<\/a> about how to handle rent freezes for the city\u2019s stabilized units.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, other groups of people in New York and around the world have faced brand-new financial hardships. As a result, many are feeling anxious about whether they\u2019ll be able to afford to pay rent and bills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, there have been speculations about rent assistance from the government for renters. In an announcement on 7th May, Mayor de Blasio didn&#8217;t confirm that he would be freezing rent in New York for tenants in non-controlled apartments. But he did announce that New Yorkers can use their security deposits to pay rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: \u201cI urge the state to act and to allow renters to use their security deposits to pay rent. There is no reason at this point given how much dislocation has occurred that a security deposit sitting in a bank account\u2026can help the renter, help the landlord have money to pay for their expenses.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" data-attachment-id=\"7673\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/rent-freeze-program-nyc\/attachment\/rented-new-york-apartments\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rented-new-york-apartments.jpg?fit=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,427\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rented-new-york-apartments\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rented-new-york-apartments.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rented-new-york-apartments.jpg?fit=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rented-new-york-apartments.jpg?resize=640%2C427&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Rented apartments in NYC\" class=\"wp-image-7673\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rented-new-york-apartments.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/rented-new-york-apartments.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-am-i-eligible-for-rent-freeze\">Am I eligible for rent freeze?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The NYC Rent Freeze Program may apply to you if you are 62 years old or older, or disabled, and earn below $50,000. To be sure, use this <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/rentfreeze\/tools\/rent-freeze-qualifier-tool.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">rent freeze qualifier tool<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, there\u2019s no explicit rent relief for people living in New York if they don&#8217;t qualify for the Rent Freeze Program. However, a housing advocacy organization, Housing Justice for All, is currently pushing for a statewide rent freeze. There may be updates in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, you have to continue paying rent in New York if you\u2019re not eligible for assistance from the government \u2013 at least until we hear otherwise from official sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-will-i-be-evicted-if-i-can-t-pay-rent\">Will I be evicted if I can\u2019t pay rent?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 20th this year, Mayor de Blasio announced a 90-day ban on evictions through an <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.governor.ny.gov\/sites\/governor.ny.gov\/files\/atoms\/files\/EO_202.8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">executive order<\/a>. This was to protect tenants who may be going through some hardships at the minute. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not obligated to pay rent. The moratorium provides temporary relief to those struggling, who can at least feel confident that they won\u2019t be evicted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently, Cuomo extended the 90-day moratorium until August 20th, 2020. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-might-they-freeze-my-rent-sometime-soon\">Might they freeze my rent sometime soon?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Possibly. There are discussions around suspending rent in the city. De Blasio said at a news conference, \u201cIf ever there was a time there should be a rent freeze, it is now.\u201d<br>There is a <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nysenate.gov\/legislation\/bills\/2019\/s8125\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">proposed rent freeze bill in committee<\/a>, which needs support from Andrew Cuomo before it can be passed. It would help those whom the pandemic has affected financially. This includes residents left without work or who have had salary cuts and small business tenants that can&#8217;t operate anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers learn more about rent freeze in NYC?
