And precisely how cheap is \u201ccheap\u201d? The answers might surprise you.

Because while true in many senses, it\u2019s Texas\u2019s famed \u201cmore bang for your buck\u201d lifestyle that could ultimately be driving up prices. Let\u2019s walk through the specifics of living in Texas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cost of living in Texas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To put this into perspective, the cost of living in Austin is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.numbeo.com\/cost-of-living\/city_result.jsp?country=United+States&amp;city=San+Francisco%2C+CA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">51 percent cheaper<\/a> than in San Francisco. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.numbeo.com\/cost-of-living\/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&amp;country2=United+States&amp;city1=New+York%2C+NY&amp;city2=Austin%2C+TX&amp;tracking=getDispatchComparison\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">40 percent cheaper<\/a> than in New York City, aka the country\u2019s two most expensive housing markets. And while dinner won\u2019t cost you an arm and a leg,&nbsp;residents&nbsp;say other areas are taking a hit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cAnecdotal experience and cost of living in Texas data will show that this price increase is almost exclusively in rent,\u201d says Luke Orlando, a lifelong Texan, and a senior at The University of Texas at Austin majoring in finance and government.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Taxes in Texas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You might start packing your bags immediately after you hear this: Texas is one of seven states that don\u2019t charge an <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/finance\/guide-to-filing-taxes-as-a-college-student\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">income tax<\/a>. Depending on where you stand in your tax brackets, it could be putting a lot of extra pennies in your pocket. Sounds amazing, right? Well, not so fast. It turns out that Texas\u2019s property taxes are pretty hefty.&nbsp;In fact, Texas comes in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thefiscaltimes.com\/2015\/08\/14\/10-Worst-States-Property-Taxes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sixth place<\/a> for the highest property tax in the country. And that means higher rent. Which brings us to the main point:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rising rents for living in Texas<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering just how fast rents are rising for living in Texas? Enough to land both Austin and Houston on the list of&nbsp;top 10 metropolitan areas that had the highest rent increases last year. Not too far down the list of cities with rising rents: San Antonio (yes, even with or maybe because of San Antonio&#8217;s urban legends) and Dallas-Fort Worth. And at least for the capital city,&nbsp;experts suspect residents will suffer through another spike in 2016, by as much as 5 to 6 percent. It\u2019s unsurprisingly unsettling for both new and current residents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cRelative to the rest of the U.S., Texas is still fairly cheap to live in,\u201d says longtime Texan and Austinite Emily Ergas. \u201cBut rent in Austin is rising significantly every year, and many of my friends have had to move once their leases were up due to a rise in prices. And gentrification is clearly happening in parts of town [contributing to the higher cost of living].\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary: Living in Texas is \u201ccheap\u201d comparatively, but the recent influx of newcomers is creating a demand for more housing. Still, there\u2019s one thing that Texas offers many young professionals that cities like NYC and SF simply don\u2019t, points out Orlando.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cPeople moving here have driven up the cost of rent, making it comparable to other large cities, but the opportunities for savings absolutely still exist in Texas metros and will for the foreseeable future.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Myth #2: It\u2019s a place to \u201csettle down.\u201d<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Texas is currently leading the nation in population growth, so it\u2019s clear those looking for greener pastures (maybe literally) are headed down south. And while the big open spaces slower paced lifestyles are a draw for families and baby boomers, they\u2019re not the only ones with the Texas Bug.&nbsp;San Antonio (with San Antonio&#8217;s urban legends) saw the largest growth in millennial population among America\u2019s largest metros, with a 9.2 increase between 2010 and 2013. Houston\u2019s millennial population grew by 6.2 percent during this time; Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s by 4.7 percent; and Austin\u2019s by 4.2 percent. All four metros were in the top 25 of the list. Texas, you could say, is very much \u201cin.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThe mild winters and robust job markets are huge draws for Austin,\u201d says Orlando. \u201cI love our lack of congestion, incredible food options, and the palpable sense of Texan exceptionalism.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Myth #3: Texas is old-fashioned and politically monochromatic.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a reason why some are calling Austin the new San Francisco. The <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/tech.co\/make-way-silicon-valley-heres-tech-startups-flocking-austin-2015-04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recent swell<\/a> of tech startups in Texas\u2019s capital have contributed immensely to the city\u2019s well known love for diversity. (Are you really surprised when the city\u2019s motto is&nbsp;\u201cKeep Austin Weird\u201d?) It\u2019s particularly the mix of old and new, Texans say, that make living in Texas so great. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just as likely to find a chic new coffee shop or tech startup as you are a taco truck or panaderia even in lower-income areas in east Austin,\u201d says Orlando.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Southern stereotypes don\u2019t fit every Texan any more than they fit every Southerner. So while it may be a largely red state, not every Texan is made the same. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI lived abroad in Chile and Spain for two years, and the most common questions were: \u2018Do you ride a horse to school? Do you own a gun? Do you love George Bush?\u2019 No on all accounts actually,\u201d says Ergas, exasperated.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And the newcomers can be just as bad, she adds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cThey expect Southern accents, guns, cowboys and Republicans, so people are generally surprised when they don\u2019t find that. People eventually realize that the major cities in Texas are fairly liberal, and that accents and cowboys aren\u2019t the norm.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Myth #4: Texas is big.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so this isn\u2019t a myth, but \u201cbig\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it, so it bears explaining. Texas is massive. Like, <em>huge<\/em>. Big enough to have once been a country (something Texans <a href=\"http:\/\/www.history.com\/this-day-in-history\/texas-declares-independence\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">still celebrate<\/a> today, by the way).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPeople from other states and countries always underestimate the size of Texas,\u201d Ergos says. \u201cIt still shocks people that I attended a university in-state, but it was a five-hour drive home.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is this important for renters living in Texas? There\u2019s plenty of room to grow for everyone flocking here, of course. According to Orlando, the urban sprawl is one of the things newcomers have to get used to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cChicago is about 234 sq. miles and has several hundred thousand more people than Houston, which is 600 sq. miles,\u201d he points out.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Very recently there has been some controversy on this subject, as residents chafe&nbsp;about the recent increase in housing development and the push to build on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailytexanonline.com\/2016\/02\/17\/austin-should-embrace-urban-density-not-reject-it\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">smaller lots<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Myth #5: Texans ride a horse to school.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No. Just\u2026.no. Please, for the sake of every Texan out there, don\u2019t ask anyone if this is true! It\u2019s not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So get while the gettin\u2019s good.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There you have it. While rent might be increasing in Texas, and the spooky San Antonio urban legends might just be true, the cost of living in Texas certainly beats out many other major cities; there\u2019s plenty of room to spread out, and with the boom in jobs in the state, it\u2019s the perfect place for young professionals to <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/career\/inspirational-career-books-to-read-during-your-20s-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">start their careers<\/a>.
