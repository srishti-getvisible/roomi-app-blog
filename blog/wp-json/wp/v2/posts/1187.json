Or if they don\u2019t like you, and you can&#8217;t form a good roommate relationship. Moreover, if you live with a roommate who hates your friends, what can you do about that? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you fail to understand why your roomi is so against your awesome group of BFFs? Then it\u2019s time to take an outsider\u2019s view at the situation!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-consider-why-your-roommate-hates-your-friends\">Consider why your roommate hates your friends<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love your friends and you can\u2019t understand why anyone else would think otherwise. Then think about some common reasons why your roommate and friends might be struggling to make a bond. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first step is to think about the problems in your head. Then it will be easier to know which steps to take next to fix your roommate&#8217;s relationship with your friends. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"731\" data-attachment-id=\"7923\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/roommate-hates-friends-what-to-do\/attachment\/roommate-hates-my-friends-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommate-hates-my-friends.jpeg?fit=1820%2C1300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1820,1300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"roommate-hates-my-friends\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommate-hates-my-friends.jpeg?fit=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommate-hates-my-friends.jpeg?fit=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommate-hates-my-friends.jpeg?resize=1024%2C731&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"two girls sitting back to back \" class=\"wp-image-7923\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommate-hates-my-friends.jpeg?resize=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommate-hates-my-friends.jpeg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommate-hates-my-friends.jpeg?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommate-hates-my-friends.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1097&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommate-hates-my-friends.jpeg?resize=1200%2C857&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/roommate-hates-my-friends.jpeg?w=1820&amp;ssl=1 1820w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by asking yourself these basic questions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-often-are-your-friends-over\"><strong>How often are your friends over? <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find yourself thinking &#8216;my roommate hates my friends&#8217; often, think about how much time they spend in your apartment. Is it more than 2-3 times per week? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that is the case, it might be affecting your roommate&#8217;s relationship with you as well! They might feel that their space is being invaded and they\u2019re uncomfortable in their own home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-your-roommate-hates-your-friends-because-they-re-loud-or-messy\">Y<strong>our roommate hate<\/strong>s<strong> your friends because they&#8217;re loud or messy <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another probable reason why your roommate hates your friends could be the way your friends behave with them. They could unknowingly be acting disrespectfully towards your roommate\u2019s space. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So think about whether they\u2019re loud, messy or they\u2019re constantly taking up the kitchen or bathroom. If this is the case, it will probably affect your roommate\u2019s quality of life, and ultimately your roommate relationship too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-your-friends-make-an-effort-with-your-roommate\"><strong>Do your friends make an effort with your roommate? <\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your friends haven\u2019t bothered to get to know your roommate, this can be one of the reasons your roommate hates your friends. So your job is to make sure you\u2019ve properly introduced them so your roommate doesn\u2019t feel left out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-invite-your-roommate-to-hang-out-when-your-friends-come-around\">Invite your roommate to hang out when your friends come around<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think it&#8217;s not that your roommate hates your friends, but they simply haven&#8217;t gotten a chance to get to know each other, give them a chance to mingle. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask them to join you guys for a Netflix binge or invite them out for drinks or dinner. So the goal here is to strengthen your roommate relationship and open up some common dialogue between them and your friends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"731\" data-attachment-id=\"7921\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/roommate-hates-friends-what-to-do\/attachment\/living-with-a-roommate\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-a-roommate.jpeg?fit=1820%2C1300&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1820,1300\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"living-with-a-roommate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-a-roommate.jpeg?fit=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-a-roommate.jpeg?fit=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-a-roommate.jpeg?resize=1024%2C731&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"four girls talking to cultivate roommate relationship \n\" class=\"wp-image-7921\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-a-roommate.jpeg?resize=1024%2C731&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-a-roommate.jpeg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-a-roommate.jpeg?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-a-roommate.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1097&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-a-roommate.jpeg?resize=1200%2C857&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/living-with-a-roommate.jpeg?w=1820&amp;ssl=1 1820w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has redeeming qualities. Try to create connections between your roommate and friends. Maybe something like, <em>\u201cBrad, did I tell you Nicole is a Knicks fan, too?\u201d<\/em> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Even totally different personality types can find common ground somewhere.<\/a> So instead of thinking &#8216;my roommate hates my friends,&#8217; make an effort to cultivate friendship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-talk-to-your-roommate\">Talk to your roommate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think your roommate hates your friends to an extent that they seem reluctant to hang out, have a heart-to-heart with your roommate. It\u2019s important that you get to the bottom of <em>why <\/em>your roommate hates your friends. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to have a successful conversation, ask open-ended questions but approach the conversation with sensitivity. Simply demanding, \u201cwhy do you hate my friends so much?\u201d will make your roommate feel defensive, and they won\u2019t want to share their feelings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead, try something like <em>\u201cI get the feeling you don\u2019t like my friends as much as I do. I don\u2019t want you to feel uncomfortable in your own apartment, so I\u2019d love it if we could work something out.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-make-an-effort-to-give-your-roommate-their-space\">Make an effort to give your roommate their space<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If living with a roommate teaches us one thing, it is that sometimes we just have to accept that some personalities don\u2019t &#8211; and probably never will &#8211; vibe well together. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you\u2019ve tried everything you can to make things amicable when your friends are over (i.e. asked them to stop drinking all the coffee and to turn down the music after 10 p.m.), and still feel like your roommate hates your friends &#8211; then you need to reassess their visiting schedule to save your roommate relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-limit-the-number-of-times-your-friends-come-to-visit\">Limit the number of times your friends come to visit<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To make living with a roommate easier, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/healthy-living-for-you-and-your-roommate-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">make house rules<\/a> for a maximum number of guest visits per week. (Usually 2-3 is a standard amount.) And make sure your friends stick to the rule! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your roomi will appreciate you making the effort to give them space. And if they see your friends less often, they might not mind their presence quite as much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-put-yourself-in-their-shoes\">Put yourself in their shoes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re feeling annoyed about having to reduce visits from friends, think about how you\u2019d feel if you hated your roommate\u2019s friends. <a label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/confession\/comments\/9b3p5q\/i_hate_my_roommates_best_friend\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Or go onto forums where people talk about why they hate their roommate&#8217;s friends. <\/a>However, you could try other activities instead; explore what NYC has to offer or hang out at your friends\u2019 apartments for a change!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers cope when their roommate hates their friends?
