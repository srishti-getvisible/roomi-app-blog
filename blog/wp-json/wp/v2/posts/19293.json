As a result, many room finders are available online, but which one is best? Which one can you <em>actually<\/em> use to move? In this article, we&#8217;ll give you two options, Airbnb and Roomi (an <a href=\"https:\/\/competitor.roomiapp.com\/rooms-finder-compare\/airbnb-vs-roomi\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Airbnb alternative<\/a>!). We&#8217;ll talk to you about the app&#8217;s features, prices, and even their security! So, read on to find out which room finder is the best for finding rooms for rent in NYC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room\">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/f9jwBVzohvX7LSRqWU\" title=\"pros\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>When choosing a room finder, you should consider the features and benefits available to get the most out of it. Below we&#8217;ve listed some of the key features that most people look for in a room finder, to help you decide between Roomi and Airbnb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"no-fee-apartments\">No fee apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the option of no-fee apartments is unusual in most room finders. Fortunately, Roomi, the <a href=\"https:\/\/competitor.roomiapp.com\/rooms-finder-compare\/airbnb-vs-roomi\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Airbnb alternative<\/a>, offers plenty of no-fee listings to its users. This means that there aren&#8217;t any hidden or extra charges on top of your rent, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about going over your budget. In Airbnb, you have to pay a service fee of up to 14.2% of the subtotal for every confirmed booking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pet-friendly-apartments\">Pet-Friendly Apartments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding apartments that allow pets is tricky and may even lead to disappointment. However, with Roomi&#8217;s pet-friendly filters, you may be surprised by how smoothly your room hunting can go! Just choose the filter according to which pet you have (a dog, cat, or any other pet!) and Roomi will show all appropriate listings. Airbnb has the same feature, but you aren&#8217;t able to choose what kind of pet you have. Without this clarity, you could face issues with your landlord when moving in or even be refused.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"subletting\">Subletting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Roomi and Airbnb have worldwide subletting services available for their users, but what makes Roomi stand out is their quick and safe process. The <a href=\"https:\/\/competitor.roomiapp.com\/rooms-finder-compare\/airbnb-vs-roomi\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Airbnb alternative<\/a> provides complete background checks and has secure in-app messaging to ensure the safety of its users. Airbnb also conducts background checks but requires a service fee of 3% for all Airbnb hosts and more for Airbnb Plus hosts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities\">Filtering rooms based on amenities<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for a new place to live online gives us the luxury to choose the amenities we want in potential properties. But unfortunately, not all room finders have the specific feature that fits your needs. With Roomi&#8217;s many filters, you can think of any amenity and this <a href=\"https:\/\/competitor.roomiapp.com\/rooms-finder-compare\/airbnb-vs-roomi\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Airbnb alternative<\/a> will make it work! From having a doorman to month-to-month listings, Roomi can cater to your needs easily. Airbnb also lets you filter results based on amenities, but their filters are largely limited to the appliances available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms\">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type(entire place\/shared rooms)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In both Roomi and Airbnb, you can look for specific listings based on their types, like an entire place, a private room, or even a shared room. You can easily choose the filter that fits your needs and both room finders will show relevant listings to help you find a room for rent in your preferred city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules\">Filtering rooms based on House Rules<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to finding a new place, house rules are an important factor that should be considered. Thankfully, Roomi and Airbnb both offer house rules filters, but Airbnb only has pets and smoking options. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/competitor.roomiapp.com\/rooms-finder-compare\/airbnb-vs-roomi\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Airbnb alternative<\/a> Roomi, lets you choose whether you&#8217;re okay with drinking, drugs, and even having couples over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features\">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:62%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/26uf14WIlvzuZkKLS\" title=\"pricing\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of things to factor in when finding rooms for rent in NYC and the most pressing one is money. So, it&#8217;s vital that you use a room finder that is either free or charges a small fee to find everything that you&#8217;re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"allowing-free-listings\">Allowing Free Listings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Roomi, all users have two free credits to create two listings or to activate any pending or deactivated listings. But you can easily purchase more if you feel like those aren&#8217;t enough with Roomi&#8217;s flexible credit plans. Plus, with a Roomi Gold subscription, that only costs $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week, you can get even more out of this <a href=\"https:\/\/competitor.roomiapp.com\/rooms-finder-compare\/airbnb-vs-roomi\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Airbnb alternative<\/a>! For one, you&#8217;ll receive a Fully Verified badge for your profile, have unlimited messages, get five more active listings (that are 7x more boosted!), and save on booking fees! In Airbnb, posting a listing is free of charge, but in some cases, renters may be subject to extra fees such as a service fee or host-only fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-app-messaging\">In-app messaging<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many websites like Airbnb have free in-app messaging, but how sure are you that your messages are kept safe and secure? Thankfully Roomi offers great security and free in-app messaging! You can message potential landlords or roommates within the app for free, without having to worry about your privacy. Airbnb also has in-app messaging, but you only can send a few messages daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible\">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to room finders, it&#8217;s important to ensure that the app you&#8217;re using has credible listings and that your contact information is stored securely. That&#8217;s why Roomi, an <a href=\"https:\/\/competitor.roomiapp.com\/rooms-finder-compare\/airbnb-vs-roomi\" target=\"_blank\" label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">Airbnb alternative<\/a>, takes the extra step to make sure that all users are protected. This includes a thorough verification process (providing a copy of their lease, utility bill, or any government-issued ID) and hiding the exact location of listings. Similarly, Airbnb verifies and does background checks on its users for added peace of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you\">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?<\/h2>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:75%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3orieKZtxf90bKHuww\" title=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/3orieKZtxf90bKHuww\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p>Both Roomi and Airbnb have many similar features, but which room finder is the best to use when finding rooms for rent in NYC? For one, Roomi has more specific filters when it comes to searching for listings and it will cost you way less when subletting and booking rooms. With Airbnb, on the other hand, there are extra charges and fewer filters to choose from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all these things considered, Roomi is the definitive choice when deciding which room finder to use. So, what are you waiting for? Download the app now and start the search for your ideal room!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-white-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim\"><\/span><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignfull is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:24% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" data-attachment-id=\"5969\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/co-living\/shared-apps\/attachment\/roomi-app\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=1600%2C1066&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1066\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Roomi-App\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Roomi-App-best roommate finder\" class=\"wp-image-5969 size-full\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1536%2C1023&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Roomi-App.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Roomi is your one-stop option to list or find rooms, find roommates to settle into a new city easily.
