A fire is unpredictable and dangerous. So it\u2019s that much more important you prepare in case one breaks out on Spaghetti and Meatballs Night. Make sure all of your smoke alarms are active. (Yes, they drove you crazy when you <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/lifestyle\/10-life-lessons-learned-from-cooking-roomi\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">burned the bacon<\/a> that one time, but that\u2019s no excuse not to put the batteries back in). Keep a small fire extinguisher in the kitchen, get&nbsp;renters insurance, and of course, map several fire escape plan routes from each room. Don\u2019t know where to start? Here are&nbsp;six important steps to take when preparing your fire safety plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Before a fire<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Assess your surroundings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Emergency response expert and CEO of Epicenter Media &amp; Training <a href=\"https:\/\/about.me\/chris_tarantino\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Christopher Tarantino<\/a> says the first step to preparing for a fire escape plan is to understand how much you\u2019re at risk for one in your home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cRisks can include living in a high-rise or on a higher floor of your building, living right next to a chemical engineering lab, having a window that faces a busy street, living in a natural hazard-prone area ((like tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.) Or any number of hazards that may increase the likelihood of bad stuff happening to you.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, take a look around your apartment before you sit to make your fire escape plan. Remember when your mom warned you to turn the stove off and not to hang things near space heaters? She wasn\u2019t just nagging. Cooking equipment is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfpa.org\/research\/reports-and-statistics\/fires-by-property-type\/residential\/home-structure-fires\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">leading cause<\/a> of household fires (making up about 45 percent of structural fires), with heating equipment following in second. So pay careful attention to these appliances. Keep them updated, clean, and free of debris. As&nbsp;Erik Endress, CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/about.share911.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"broken_link\">Share911.com<\/a> and volunteer firefighter of 30 years says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThe best way to be prepared is to ensure that you have working smoke and fire alarm systems that will wake you up if the fire happens while you\u2019re sleeping. If you sleep with your door closed, check to make sure that the sound of the alarm will actually wake you and your roommates up.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Make a fire escape plan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So you know your risks now. Your appliances are updated. You practice good caution. And your smoke alarms are good to go. The next step is to make a fire escape plan. Living in an apartment complex, you can still be in the line of fire even if trouble starts down the hall. Endress says the simplest safety methods are the best when preparing for escape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cKnow your plan for egress. Stand in each room and ask yourself, what is the fastest fire escape plan? It may be that the fire escape or a balcony where you can wait for firefighters will provide a better environment than trying to evacuate down the stairs.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Communication is also extremely important. And the best thing you and your roommate can do is make a fire safety plan together. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cHow can we combat this risk?\u201d Endress recommends asking each other. \u201cIdentify the tools that are at your disposal (including a emergency and\/or escape plan.) Such as a fire extinguisher, and make sure all roommates know where it\u2019s kept and how to use it.<\/p><p>\u201cLook at and evaluate escape routes keeping in mind the path may be dark, smoke-filled or obstructed. Think about worst-case scenarios and discuss how you would respond as a team.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, make sure you have a meet-up point to find each other if you get separated due to your fire escape plan. After making it to safety, the next step is to check on your roommates, neighbors and anyone else who may have been in the building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Practice your fire escape plan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you\u2019ve heard it often enough to hate the word, but here it is some more. Practice, practice, practice your fire escape plan.&nbsp;Remember all those fire drills from school? It\u2019s time to do some of those at home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThere is a saying in the fire service that\u2019s used for firefighter training. But still applies nicely here. Don\u2019t practice until you get it right. Practice until you can\u2019t get it wrong,\u201d says Tarantino.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-attachment-id=\"12255\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/6-critical-steps-fire-safety-plan\/attachment\/fire-truck\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/fire-truck-.jpeg?fit=1050%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1050,700\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fire-truck-\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/fire-truck-.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/fire-truck-.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/fire-truck-.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"A fire truck \" class=\"wp-image-12255\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/fire-truck-.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/fire-truck-.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/fire-truck-.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/fire-truck-.jpeg?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">During a fire<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Assess your surroundings before acting out your fire escape plan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, now it\u2019s time to put all your practice to good use. Let\u2019s say the apartment is aflame. Before you start panicking, remember your fire escape plan. Then take a quick second to assess where the fire might be coming from. Tarantino points out that not all fires need intervention from professionals. But it\u2019s totally okay to call 911 if you\u2019re uncertain. If the fire is small and can be handled safely with a small extinguisher, douse the offending meal. If the blaze is any larger than a stovetop fire, leap into action with your fire safety plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Put your fire escape plan to action<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When taking your fire escape plan route, it\u2019s super important to watch for structural damage, check doorknobs with the back of your hand, and close doors behind you. The first is obvious: If you see beams falling in, the fire and the smoke will be the least of your problems in that direction. If you try a doorknob and it\u2019s red-hot, find another route. And closing doors behind you ensures the fire has more barriers before getting through. If you\u2019re unable to escape the building, use alternate plans involving windows like a fire escape or hook-ladder. And if you\u2019re only a floor above the ground, you might be forced to jump.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cIf you have to jump, reduce the distance you will fall by hanging down from the window, which reduces your fall by your height,\u201d advises Endress.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Regroup!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whew, you made it out okay. After you\u2019ve spoken with firefighter personnel, it\u2019s time to meet up at your designated checkpoint. Whether it was a small kitchen fire or a blazing inferno that consumed the whole floor,&nbsp;it\u2019s important everyone is accounted for in the aftermath. In the middle of a disaster, it\u2019s not unlikely people will forget their phones and other electronics, which is why an official meeting place is that much more important to include in your fire safety plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>\u201cThe first question the fire department will likely ask is whether or not everyone is out of the building, so make sure you keep good communication with your roommates and you understand how emergency response works in your area or university,\u201d says Tarantino.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>D\u2019you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers make a fool-proof fire escape plan?
