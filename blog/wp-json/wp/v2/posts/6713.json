Maybe you like minimalist decor, while they\u2019re a hoarder. Differences in home decor preferences can be really annoying. But coliving means you have to accept your differences and try to find common ground. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be unhappy with your apartment. Changing up your home decor can be great for your mental health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in order to revamp your home decor, you need to declutter first. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen enough Marie Kondo videos to know what I\u2019m talking about. So how do you do it? How do you declutter when you share an apartment with someone? You can\u2019t just get up one day and throw away half the stuff in your house because you want to take your home decor to the next level. You and your roommate need to be in this together- that\u2019s what coliving is about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why today, we\u2019re going to show you how to declutter when you share an apartment with another person!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/4ZtzzqkAahINGZoUxo\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/4ZtzzqkAahINGZoUxo\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">See also: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/why-natural-light-is-the-best-apartment-decor-ever\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Why Natural Sunlight Is Apartment Decor &amp; Therapy In One<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share an apartment, Share the burden<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re coliving with someone, you need to divide up chores evenly, it\u2019s only fair. You can\u2019t share an apartment with someone and not do any of the work (and vice versa). So if you\u2019re dividing up everything else, then why should decluttering be only one\u2019s person\u2019s job? Get your roommate with you one weekend and just start sorting through all your stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decluttering can be really difficult for some people, so having another person to do it with is actually a great idea. Pick one day where you declutter your part of the house and another day for your roommates. You can sort through your common items one afternoon, it probably won\u2019t take a lot of time. Let your roommate know that if they want a cute new home decor, they need to get rid of the old stuff!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:56%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/ozjeCxDeMNePgS6mcv\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/ozjeCxDeMNePgS6mcv\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<p><strong>Roomi advice: We know you&#8217;re probably very enthusiastic about decluttering your home. But be careful when you\u2019re dealing with your roommate\u2019s stuff. Some people have a very strong emotional connection to the stuff they own. Don\u2019t force them to throw out anything that they hold near their heart!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thespruce.com\/when-to-get-rid-of-clutter-2647992\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here\u2019s a helpful guide<\/a> to help you decide what stuff to keep and what to throw away.<\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Focus on what you have in common<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re deciding on what to keep and what to throw away with your roommates, make sure you keep in mind what you two have in common aesthetically. If you have a hot pink lamp that they hate, throw it away. Similarly, if they have a painting you hate, ask them to get rid of it. That\u2019s just how it works when you share an apartment with another person. At the end of this process, you will start to see what your shared aesthetic really is. This step is really important to figure out what your home decor is going to look like. Coliving tends to bring out some eccentric home styles and we\u2019re here for it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Roomi Advice: Set a number of things that you both will need to give up- nothing more and nothing less. This way, no one will feel like they\u2019re being forced to get rid of more stuff than the other person.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog2.roomiapp.com\/us\/apartment-hacks\/home-decor-tips-by-nyc-interior-designers\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">5 Simple Tips From NYC Interior Designers To Ramp Up Your Home Decor<\/a><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay Decluttered<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve gone through the painful process of throwing stuff away, don\u2019t go right back to buying more stuff to fill the empty space! It defeats the whole purpose. Because you share an apartment with them, make sure your roommate is on the same page as you on this one. Make a pact, a coliving pact, if you will. No one buys more than two new things a month. If you and your roommates are avid shoppers, this might be hard for you, but you\u2019ve got this! This is how your home decor will remain coherent and uncluttered!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/bemorewithless.com\/how-to-stop-shopping\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here are some really helpful tips<\/a> if you have a hard time giving up shopping.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter\">\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top:100%\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<iframe src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/AS7CiXvwZhmKmKYGV6\" title=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/AS7CiXvwZhmKmKYGV6\/giphy.gif\"><\/iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figure>\n\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maximize your space<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, one of the great joys of home decor- maximizing your existing space! When you share an apartment with someone, your place can fill up so fast that you forget just how much space you actually have. But now that you and your roommate have decluttered, all that space is back. Maybe you can install new shelves or rearrange your living room just to change things up. Get your roommate and strategize about what to do with all this new space!
