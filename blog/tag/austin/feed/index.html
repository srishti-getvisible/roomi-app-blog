<p>One of the most interesting places to visit in Austin is the Palmetto State Park. Although you’ll be surrounded by overgrown vegetation, the Palmetto plants and the scenic beauty have a Jurassic vibe to it. Take a walk along the flat trails which cut through the algae-covered swamps surrounding the palmettos, or, if you’re feeling adventurous, you can canoe or kayak across the swamps as well. As the only park in the state with tropical vegetation, The Palmetto State Park should be a mandatory stop on your Austin tour.</p>



<p><strong>Costs:</strong> $3 for Adults and Free for children 12 years or under.</p>



<p><strong>Timings:</strong> Open daily</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;ve been planning a move to or are looking for rooms for rent in Austin, you should know you&#8217;re in for a good time. In 2019, Austin was voted as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2019/05/31/is-austin-texas-the-best-city-in-america/?sh=496a233c65c5">the best place to live in America</a> for the third time in a row. In 2020, it was the second-best place to live in America. Now, if that&#8217;s not telling of how much people love the place and how much it has to offer to the people who choose to call it home, then what is?</p>



<p>But on a serious note, as with everything in life, picking a neighborhood to rent a room in Austin should also depend on a bunch of factors. But mostly, it should be a decision based on what you&#8217;re into. Here are some factors to put things into perspective.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Austin</h2>



<p>The phrase, &#8220;Everything is bigger in Texas,&#8221; never gets old. But for everyone who is still considering finding rooms for rent in Austin, you should know that this phrase very well applies to the heat as well. Austin’s weather is amazing 10 months out of the year, and there’s barely a winter to speak of. But when July and August come around, you’ll see temps reaching 100+ degrees. Luckily, Austin has its fair share of public pools and swimming holes that you can take advantage of!</p>

<p>And if at all you&#8217;re a music fan, we don&#8217;t need to say much because you might already be aware of how crazy the music scene in Austin can be! Every March, hundreds of thousands of people invade the city for its annual music, film, and interactive conference and festival, <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sxsw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South by Southwest</a></strong> (SXSW, or just “South by” to locals). The other behemoth music fest is Austin City Limits (ACL), where many acts get their big break. All your favorite bands will stop in Austin on tour, every single one!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding Rooms For Rent in Austin, TX</h2>



<p>Finding rooms for rent in Austin, Tx is an experience most Austinites, old and new, swear by.</p>



<p>Austin, Texas, has recently been recognized as one of the top 10 places to purchase a rental property in the U.S. And many property owners are seeing a return on investment as high as 10.7 percent!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top Neighborhoods in Austin, TX </h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>North Loop:</strong> Think 1992, but with better pizza. North Loop is the ultimate intersection of working-class meets bohemian cohort. Its defining characteristic is its namesake street, which winds through the middle of the neighborhood. The small commercial stretch—codified at some point as the North Loop IBIZ District—contains several surprisingly long-lived local vintage and record stores, coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and such requisite oddities as the quirky convenience store, the anarchist bookshop, and the women-owned adult-toy shop.</li><li><strong>Cherry Wood:</strong> This is the ultimate special find if you&#8217;re looking for that for your next rental place in Austin. The vibe here is laid back as the laid back can be. With the gigantic shade trees, winding streets, and French place names (so many that it’s sometimes called French Place), East Austin’s Cherrywood neighborhood has a slightly Southern character. You’ll find bungalows and other small, wood-frame homes; Craftsman-style houses large and small; and one- and two-story stucco homes, many originally built for families of returning soldiers after World War II.</li><li><strong>South Menchaca</strong> Every Austinite that was done with the over-touristy nature the city quickly took over or was just simply priced out of areas of South Austin are finding community and hometown friendliness, much lower home prices, and a less hectic pace by moving just a little farther south. South Menchaca is one of the neighborhoods attracting such seekers; it’s close to those attractions when the mood hits, and more low-key, neighborly bars and shops are popping up all around!</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Average Rent in Austin, TX</h2>



<p>If we&#8217;re being honest, neighborhoods can be sensitive, organic entities, highly affected by the built and natural environments as well as by those who live there—and those who leave.</p>



<p>There’s no denying that Austin is booming. Transplants continue to move here in record numbers, thus affecting the average price of the rooms for rent in Austin, Tx. But the inventory is low, and the rental market is tight. At the same time, some longtime Austinites, overwhelmed by the transformation of their neighborhoods or just seeking a change, are on the move. So here are some numbers to put things into perspective.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rooms for Rent in Austin, TX </strong></td><td><strong>Average Rent</strong></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://bit.ly/2PyLdQN" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">1 Bedroom Apartment in Austin, TX</a></td><td>$909</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://bit.ly/3t2nS7Q" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">2 Bedroom Apartment in Austin, TX</a></td><td>$1,716</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://bit.ly/3vzD65X" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">3 Bedroom Apartment in Austin, TX</a></td><td>$2,325</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University life in Austin, TX</h2>



<p>Some of the reasons why students turn to Austin are the bustling entrepreneurial spirit, Austin&#8217;s commitment to personal freedom, and a passion for unearthing new discoveries. Add to this a vibrant, internationally renowned music, film, and art scene, along with a thriving economy that leads the way in the technology, engineering, and health care industries. Keeping this in mind, let&#8217;s move on to the top universities in Austin, TX.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of Texas at Austin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.txstate.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas State University</a></li><li><a href="https://www.southuniversity.edu/austin" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">South University &#8211; Austin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stedwards.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saint Edward&#8217;s University</a></li><li><a href="https://www.concordia.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concordia University &#8211; Texas</a></li></ul>



<p>Let&#8217;s now consider the cost of living in Austin as a student. As of 2021, a single person estimated monthly costs of living in Austin are 834.08$ without rent.</p>



<p>Although food, drinks, rent, and housing are going to be cheaper than New York or California prices, Austin still holds its own in terms of cost of living. It&#8217;s always good to remember that even if you&#8217;re able to find inexpensive rooms for rent in Austin, Tx, and you’ll still be spending on things like transportation, delicious meals at can’t-miss restaurants, and entertainment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Transit Friendly is Austin, Texas?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Walkability</h3>



<p>While not considered the most walkable city in the U.S. (Austin is the 29th most walkable large city in the US with a “walk score” of 41 out of 100), Austin is home to several neighborhoods that are more pedestrian-friendly than others.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Traffic</h3>



<p>The constant influx of residents is putting a hurt on the city’s infrastructure. There are only two main arteries for commuting (I-35 and the TX-1 Loop aka MoPac), so peak hours are pretty miserable. No joke—it will take you 30 minutes to go three miles. If possible, find a job before you find a place to live and plan your commute accordingly. Those with jobs downtown will find that it is well worth it to spend the extra dough to be closer to work, as the bus system (CapMetro) is the only viable public transportation option for Austin residents.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Taxis and Rideshares </h3>



<p>Taxis and rideshares for an integral part of Austin&#8217;s economy as well as the people&#8217;s happiness. Besides the most common Uber and Lyft, that came back to Austin after a long Hiatus just last year, there are some Austinite favorites including:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Public Transport</h3>



<p>Austin&#8217;s public Capital Metro Bus System serves a population of more than 1 million in its 535-square mile service area. With a system of more than 1,600 bus stops and 82 routes, Central Texas is served by local, MetroRapid limited-stop, MetroFlyer, MetroExpress, and University of Texas Shuttle routes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cycling</h3>



<p>With numerous hills, elaborate trails, specialist shops, and cyclist-friendly laws, Austin is an ideal city for bike enthusiasts.</p>



<p>It is ranked as the seventh-best cycling city in America by Bicycle Magazine and offers an abundance of fun trails, stocked shops, and eclectic communities devoted to cycling. Whether you&#8217;re training for the Tour de France, scaling limestone walls on your new Trek, looking to start a fixie gang, or simply using your two-wheeler to commute — Austin&#8217;s got you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nightlife in Austin</h2>



<p>There are hundreds of bars in Austin, one for everyone&#8217;s taste! The legendary 6th St bar scene has spilled onto nearby thoroughfares, especially Red River St. Many of the 6th St places are shot bars aimed at college students and tourists, while the Red River establishments retain a harder local edge. A few blocks south, Rainey St is also jumping, with old bungalows now home to watering holes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Food in Austin</h2>



<p>Everyone knows Austin’s reputation as a music town, but these days the Texas capital is just as renowned for its food, which features both traditional Texan flavors and dishes that confound stereotypical expectations. Austin has a reputation as a welcoming, friendly place, but like New Yorkers over pizza, Austinites may come damn near throwing a punch if you take issue with their choice of brisket smoker or breakfast taco maker. Local specialties like that are just the beginning of the food conversation in the Texas capital though.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll find everything you want, and then some more. So, here are some of our favorite Austin restaurants!</p>

<p><meta charset="utf-8">If we take a look at Austin on the map of Texas, you&#8217;d realize how it&#8217;s the slightest bit off-center. Yep, it&#8217;s off-center in the most characteristic way possible. In more ways than one Austin has been that place where all of the state&#8217;s best bits have come together in the most lively mix. But among all the places to visit in Austin, you&#8217;re not always going to find the most equal and measured experience. If you&#8217;re going here, expect a certain complexity in the many things to do in Austin. A complexity that is almost always difficult to gauge beforehand.</p>

</div>



<p>A formerly slow-paced but quick-witted college town was branded as a live-music capital, and later a tech-mecca. It&#8217;s the left-wing outpost of a state that&#8217;s given over to conservative politics. There&#8217;s an abundance of natural beauty, outdoors, enough and more places to sport, recreate, and get off the beaten path. The very artful people of Austin can be seen doing top-notch creative work. It&#8217;s a friendly place that&#8217;s transitioning from its cosmic cowboy past through a neo-hippie/urbanist-tech present to a big-city future, with a side of rural Texas ancestry.</p>

<p>Here are some of the many things we love about Austin, Texas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Karaoke Underground</h2>



<p>Think Karaoke — but punk. It&#8217;s everything the punk-loving amateur karaoke singer in you desires, with jams from non-chart-topping banks ranging from Crass to Sleater-Kinney.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Moonlight Towers</h2>



<p>Some think of these as odd, others call them romantic, but most refer to them as odd-romantic. They&#8217;re the ultimate Austin quirk, especially since it&#8217;s the only city <em>in the world</em> that still uses them as street lights! Here&#8217;s a <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.moontowermovie.com/?fbclid=IwAR2MghTCD9T8qXEEkeCl_HjmlsH-Fe6C8xEk4hl8dEhHVefXxi-Rytk7O0w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">very cool documentary</a> on the moonlight towers that you can check out.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Amtrak at night!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Amtrak_Wolverine_at_Royal_Oak_during_night_rain%2C_October_2014.jpg" alt="Amtrak Wolverine at Royal Oak during night rain, one of the best things to do in Austin Texas"/></figure>



<p>In isolation, the train station behind the Town Lake YMCA might not seem like much but the surroundings have always added a low-key romantic charm to it in the artiest, urban decay fashion. Disembark on a journey from the Amtrak at night, towards the bright lights of tall towers in a bustling big city — the vibes are truly immaculate <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">UT&#8217;s Landmark Program</h2>



<p>Of the many things that came out of the University of Texas&#8217; ambitious public-art acquisition agenda, <em>The Color Inside,</em> by James Turrell, a rooftop skyspace remains as one of our most favorites! You can find this at the University of Texas at Austin’s Student Activity Center, among many more such grasping concepts!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mountain laurels in full bloom</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll feel like it&#8217;s spring here even when you know you&#8217;re in the middle of winter still. They&#8217;re nothing more comforting than lush spreads of mountain laurels, what great about them is that they stay green all year round — however some may also be poisonous to animals so don&#8217;t get too comfortable with them either.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The all-age music spaces</h2>



<p>If you love music, Austin is <em>the</em> place to be. From <a href="https://www.aclfestival.com/information" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Austin Kiddie Limits</a> stage to clubs that allow kids (with supervision) and older minors to attend and play live shows.</p>



<p>The constant and persistent availability of such places are a true testament of the intergenerational approach to music that Austin proudly represents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The day after summer ends</h2>



<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be the hottest day of the year and neither would be the day where temperatures drop to chilly. That half an hour in the evening you look for and call the golden hour? Think of a whole day that&#8217;s full of similar vibes, there&#8217;s a soothing scent of autumn in the air — you know the worst heat is now done with and for another year you wouldn&#8217;t be bothered. It&#8217;s fall at its southern best.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Barton Springs&#8217; forever kind of <em>cool.</em></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/360_Barton_Springs_5July08_%289%29.JPG" alt="Barton Springs Pool, one of the nicest places to visit in Austin Texas, especially in the summer"/></figure>



<p>No, we don&#8217;t mean this figuratively. The air around Barton Springs may get hotter as temperatures increase but the water maintains the same cool temperature throughout. The city’s spring-fed pools are always around 68 degrees, a sustaining chill only natural water sources can truly provide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 90&#8217;s charm that started here</h2>



<p>The vocabulary for the decade that followed was set by <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlmfRuXxuXo" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slacker</a></em> (1990) that captured the atmosphere in the most decade-setting picturesque ways imaginable. Yeah, Richard Linklater will probably keep denying any generational influence his work had till his dying days, but we all know that&#8217;s not true.</p>



<p>Some places that have preserved this charm we speak of so fondly include this record store that goes by the name <a href="https://www.endofanear.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">End of an Ear</a>, the <a href="https://www.austintexas.org/listings/red-river-caf%C3%A9/3562/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red River Cafe,</a> or even taking a pedicab ride! If this doesn&#8217;t add to your list of places to visit in Austin, what will?</p>
