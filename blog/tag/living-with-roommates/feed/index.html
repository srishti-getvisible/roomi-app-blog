<p>If you’re tirelessly having to ask for bill money, seeing someone have a 3-week sleepover, or wondering where the smell of cigarettes is coming from, you may have not taken the time to create a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">roommate</a> agreement.</p>



<p>Having&nbsp;roommates&nbsp;in NYC is often an&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-my-roommate-is-driving-me-up-the-wall-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">economical</a>&nbsp;necessity. Choosing the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/3-traits-look-roommate/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">right roommates</a>&nbsp;is half the battle among dodging potential creepy landlords and cat-lady neighbors. Now that you’ve settled with a few people with whom you share enough common ground to cohabitate, it’s time to team up and create a roommate agreement, to avoid any major arguments in the foreseeable future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-things-to-include-in-a-roommate-agreement">10 Things to Include in a Roommate Agreement</h2>



<p>Just as you sign an agreement to lease a rental with your roommate, you need an internal agreement too. Here are 10 things to include in a roommate agreement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-splitting-shared-expenses">#1 &#8211; Splitting shared expenses</h3>



<p>Your finances are why you chose roommates in the first place. Keep your wallet and boundaries in check by including in your game plan for when, where, and who pays up.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommates-split-utilities/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Splitting utilities</a>&nbsp;with roommates can be trickier than collecting for rent, so make sure all the details are worked out in the agreement. List the person responsible for collecting payment from everyone, the utility/company the payment is for, the exact amount to be paid, and date of each month it’s due.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#2 &#8211; Household chores</h3>



<p>Unless you’re a fan of cleaning up messes you didn’t make, household chores are a priority to include in your roommate agreement.</p>



<p>It would be wise to keep a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.care.com/c/stories/5933/ultimate-household-chore-list/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">chore list</a>&nbsp;separate from your roommate agreement.&nbsp;The chart as well as the consequences for following it should be mentioned in the agreement.&nbsp;Cleaning charts should be as specific as the bill schedule listing who does what, when. You could give the “clean up your own mess” theory the ol’ college try, but if it doesn’t workout then amend your roommate agreement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3 &#8211; Guests and entertaining</h3>



<p>Next up is one for the visitors, parents, boyfriends/girlfriends, and one-night friends. Set limitations on length of stay and details to be considered during a visit. This includes letting guests know there are house rules.</p>



<p>Here, you and your roommates can iron out a lot of other details like booze or no booze in the house, where to smoke (always outside and away from front door), and&nbsp;<a href="https://untappedcities.com/2016/07/11/cities-101-nycs-noise-pollution-and-how-the-city-resolves-it/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">noise level</a> or curfew. Keep in mind each other’s schedules, your Saturday off may be someone’s Monday at work. Not a bad idea to keep everyone’s schedules in-sight before throwing a get-together and inviting a bunch of guests.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4 &#8211; Communication styles (especially with conflicts!)</h3>



<p>Encourage open and honest communication by setting up regular roommate meetings to discuss any issues or concerns that may arise. This doesn&#8217;t have to be formal meetings with a confrontational approach, it could just be a simple meal together.</p>



<p>But when issues arise, having these regular &#8216;roommate meetings&#8217; can help resolve any internal issues you may have. Remember, communication is key! Talk about your problems and make sure that all of you are open to sorting it out to ensure a smooth relationship in the apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5 &#8211; Sharing food</h3>

<p>Discuss how you&#8217;ll handle sharing food and groceries. This could include each person having their designated shelf in the refrigerator or setting up a system for sharing expenses. But if you decide to share everything, make arrangements on a grocery shopping schedule. Or you could also arrange an inventory of all the food that you have and take turns buying food for the apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#6 &#8211; Pets</h3>



<p>Although having a pet can be a source of entertainment and happiness, it&#8217;s not all rainbows and butterflies. So, whether you or your roommate has a pet or is planning to get one, it&#8217;s necessary to include this in your roommate agreement.</p>



<p>You have to consider allergies, potty times, noises a pet can bring, and all the other factors included in taking care of one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#7 &#8211; Bathroom and kitchen schedules</h3>



<p>One of the most common things to argue about among roommates is the bathroom or kitchen times. So before any major argument arises, it&#8217;s better to include a schedule in your roommate agreement. Most especially if you have multiple roommates and just limited bathroom and kitchen space, making a schedule can help save the apartment from a disastrous morning rush.</p>



<p>To get started, make a schedule of everyone&#8217;s work or school time then figure out the order of who gets to use the bathroom and kitchen first. This makes everything more efficient and prevents anyone from being late to their schedules for the day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#8 &#8211; Moving out early</h3>



<p>Moving out should be included in your roommate agreement as it can get a bit tricky without it. Your lease may state the basics, but it&#8217;s important to have everything down to a T, like who&#8217;s responsible for what among the roommates.</p>



<p>Here, determine what steps need to be taken if one roommate decides to move out, including how to handle finding a replacement or dividing any remaining lease responsibilities. Consider these as well:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How much notice should be given before formally moving out</li>



<li>Finding a replacement</li>



<li>How to divide communal items</li>



<li>Returning the security deposit</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#9 &#8211; Quiet hours</h3>



<p>We all value our sleep, and no one wants to sleep with loud music or noises around them. So, it&#8217;s better to determine appropriate times for quiet hours to ensure that everyone has an opportunity for rest and relaxation.</p>



<p>Here, talk about who are light sleepers, who has early morning shifts, or just decide on a quiet time for the whole apartment. This could also just be a group chat message or quick chat to settle on a few hours of peace and quiet.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#10 &#8211; Violations of the roommate agreement</h3>



<p>When you sign an agreement to lease a rental with your roommate, you agree to certain rules and regulations. Failing to meet those standards can get you kicked out. Well, the same should be the case for failing to uphold the roommate agreement as well.&nbsp;While this is a seriously uncomfortable situation to be in,&nbsp;it must be done.</p>



<p>Having a roommate who doesn’t honor the roommate agreement&nbsp;can be infuriating to live with. If you&#8217;re roommate is a repeat offender, even with multiple house meetings and enough time to correct their wrong doings, it&#8217;s completely possible to ask for them to leave.</p>



<p>Clearly, someone who isn&#8217;t following the set rules is living as uncomfortably as those who prefer them. The agreement has been&nbsp;<em>agreed</em>&nbsp;upon and will result in consequences and really unfavorable living conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roommate Agreements</h2>



<p>Creating a strong and comprehensive roommate agreement is essential for a harmonious living situation in 2024. By including the 10 key elements discussed in this article, you can set clear expectations and ensure a positive environment for everyone involved. But before you can set roommate agreements, you first need to find roommates.</p>

Co-living has become a sustainable choice for many as the cost of living increases in cities.</p>



<p>But as it turns out, not all of them are having a great experience. There are many factors that affect your relationship with roommates and once in a while, some roommates just don’t pan out so well. Living with a roommate demands you to share resources and get along with different people. Not exactly a piece of cake for everyone!</p>

<p>Living alone is difficult. Period! It’s not just the rent or doing every chore yourself; living alone can get lonely from time to time. Living with a roommate could solve these problems &#8211; and more!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-saves-you-a-big-chunk-of-rent-and-housing-resources-"><strong>Saves you a big chunk of rent and housing resources</strong></h3>



<p>This is the biggest reason why most young adults start living with a roommate. Imagine how much you could do with the money saved on lower rent- not to mention electricity bills and other utility expenses!</p>

But it&#8217;s important to know the ins and outs of cohabitating with someone before you sign a lease together.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-how-to-find-amazing-roommates-"><strong>How to Find Amazing Roommates</strong></h2>



<p>Living with a roommate is all about trusting a stranger. Sounds unnerving, right? To put your faith in someone you barely know! But if you start off in the right direction, the pay-off is worth it. Trust us!</p>



<p><strong>Online tools and communities are a great way to begin the hunt for the perfect roommate. Roomi is one of the best roommate finder apps out there.</strong> You can get in touch with people who need roommates near you and talk to them before the meeting.

<p>When living with a roommate, it can be easy for us to set unforgiving standards for others. Don&#8217;t forget that you&#8217;re not perfect either (although you might disagree!) and reflect on your own actions before playing the blame game.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-2-dealing-with-common-roommate-problems">2. Dealing with Common Roommate Problems</h3>



<p>What are some of the most common roommate conflicts that arise when you&#8217;re living with a roommate?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sharing spaces like the living room, kitchen, and bathroom</li>



<li>Sharing the WiFi</li>



<li>Splitting bills</li>



<li>Cleaning common spaces</li>



<li>Running errands</li>



<li>Invading private space</li>



<li>Too many people in the house <strong>(What to do if your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deal-roommates-significant-never-leaves/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate&#8217;s significant other won&#8217;t leave</a>!)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The intensity of the problems can vary depending on how you react to them. Having some ground rules can help to a great extent but you must also be careful of some small loopholes.</p>

<p>For example, you&#8217;ve made a cleaning schedule for everyone to follow, and everyone has agreed. The next day you wake up and find the kitchen sink full of dishes that you didn’t use. You knock on the door of your roommate and it’s empty. They are already out for the day. ?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It can make you feel mad. Maybe you wait all day to confront your roommate, with those dirty dishes in your eyesight, and later you argue about it. But is that really going to help?</p>



<p>The best way is to calm down and assume that maybe your roommate had something urgent that made them skip the chore. Ask them about it and try to understand their reasons. Once you have listened, you can tell them how it was difficult for you to manage your breakfast on time because they didn’t do the dishes.</p>

<p>Whether you are inviting a new roommate in or already living with a roommate, there are always a few expectations &#8211; the “ground rules”, as we like to call them. You&#8217;re expected to clean your own dishes and empty the garbage when it gets full, for example. Not everyone is as lucky as Rachel to have Monica do all the cleaning!</p>

<p>Setting house rules for roommates is no easy task. Begin with regular house meetings to get everyone on the same page regarding chores and errands. Divide the daily and weekly tasks for everyone to follow. Go together for tasks like buying groceries; you might find it&#8217;s a fun, bonding activity!</p>

<p>Living with a roommate demands you to become an adult, and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-manage-finances-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">managing finances</a> is paramount. Splitting the rent and paying utility bills on time is important for everyone in the house. However, if your roommate has a genuine reason to not pay the rent on time- it’s okay! Financial situations may go up and down once in a while for everyone. It’s okay to wait a day or two if your roommate is not able to pay the bills, but you can send them a gentle reminder to let them know that it’s rent day. ?</p>



<p>Splitting bills with roommates can get even more complicated when you make lots of shared purchases. Grabbing margaritas at the weekend, ordering pizza for dinner, or buying furniture for the home? All too often, one person fronts the bill and the others take far too long to pay it back.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-5-setting-boundaries-in-between-all-the-sharing">5. Setting Boundaries in Between all the Sharing</h3>



<p>Living with a roommate is all about learning to share while maintaining boundaries. You share a small space including the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. Check out some <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sharing-a-closet-with-spouse-organization-ideas/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ideas for sharing a closet.</a></p>

<p>Have a clear discussion on which groceries can be shared and what is off-limits. And if you are a Joey who doesn’t share food, it’s okay to let your roommate know. Just remember: that also means you can&#8217;t help yourself to their snacks&#8230; no matter how good they may look!</p>

<p><strong>Boundaries especially come into play when you talk about privacy</strong>. The bedroom is probably the only place that is completely private, so always ask permission before entering. If you share a bedroom, you must respect their personal belongings.</p>



<p>Despite this, sometimes we forget where the lines are. Say, for example, your laptop suddenly stops working one day and you decide to work on your roommate’s laptop. <strong>And what about <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sharing-wifi-with-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing wifi with roommates</a>?</strong></p>

<p>It seems <em>natural</em> to hack resources but this is a strict no-no. Ask politely to avoid any dramatic run-ins. If your roommate isn&#8217;t comfortable sharing their stuff, respect that and move on.</p>



<p><strong>Taking it to the emotional level, relationships that involve regular interaction require boundaries.</strong> When you are living with a roommate, you need to understand when you can be great buddies and when you need to give them some space.</p>

<p>Not all roommates want to share their personal problems and there are a couple of things that might surface when living together. You may have an <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-expert-tips-co-living-introvert-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">introverted roommate</a> who doesn&#8217;t want to go into every detail about their life. Aim to be a friend when they need you, but always make sure to respect their boundaries.</p>



<p>On the other hand, living with an <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-expert-tips-co-living-extrovert-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">extroverted roommate</a> could require you to set your boundaries clearly. If you find yourself living with a roommate that constantly wants to socialize, make sure you&#8217;re on the same page so you can enjoy some alone time, too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-6-fun-activities-should-be-part-of-the-daily-chores">6. Fun Activities Should be Part of the Daily Chores</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;re crystal clear about the boundaries, there is so much freedom to enjoy when living with a roommate. You could arrange a fun outing once a week or invite friends over for a house party on special occasions. But beyond that, you must also have the time in your daily routine to talk and chill out.</p>



<p>People who spend time with their roommates every day have a greater chance of having a satisfactory roommate relationship. Simple acts like going out for a morning walk together can help you get along better.</p>



<p>Doing chores with roomies makes the dreaded deep-clean more fun. Once a month, why not plan a &#8220;family dinner&#8221;, where you all go shopping and cook a feast together? <strong>There are plenty of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-bonding-activities/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate bonding activities</a> to look forward to when you are living with a roommate.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-7-let%E2%80%99s-talk-about-pets">7. Let’s Talk About Pets</h3>



<p>This one is a bonus for anyone dealing with a roommate&#8217;s pets or those with a pet of their own. Pets are just like roommates &#8211; except that they are animals and they don’t pay rent!&nbsp;Pets are the responsibility of their owners, but when you have <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deal-roommates-untrained-pet/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommates and pets</a> living together, there’s a lot to keep in mind!</p>

<p>As a pet owner living with a roommate, you&#8217;ll need to make sure everyone else in the house is cool with your furry friend. Let them know from the outset that you come as a package. And don&#8217;t expect your roommates to take care of them &#8211; the grooming, feeding, and cleaning are down to you.</p>



<p><strong>On the other hand, if you are living with a roommate who has a pet, you must let them know if there are any issues.</strong> Whether the dog is barking at night, or the house is becoming less hygienic, point this out to the pet owner. They should take responsibility for this.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-peace-resolution-101-"><strong>Peace Resolution 101</strong></h2>



<p>So, you have made the house chore chart, you are clear with your boundaries, and have happily agreed to deal with the pet situation. That’s a lot of healthy compromises and yet one fine day, it could all fall down and there could be a dramatic fight that you can’t avoid. Boom!</p>

<p>It’s alright to feel disappointed and not talk for a while. Let the dust settle down and perhaps, the intensity will fade away. <strong>Never hold a grudge due to any <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/first-hand-advice-avoiding-political-drama-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">political drama with roommates</a>.</strong> Everyone has different opinions based on unique experiences, and often it&#8217;s best to agree to disagree.</p>



<p><strong>Maintaining <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-ways-keep-peace-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">peace with your roommate</a> can test your patience</strong>. Listen with an open mind, react rationally, and keep the communication flowing when living with a roommate. Just because something your roommate has done has hurt you doesn’t mean that you should cut contact. It will just create tension &#8211; something you definitely <em>don&#8217;t</em> want at home.</p>

<p>It’s okay to knock on their door and let them know that they are disturbing you. If they don’t quiet down, get some earplugs or white noise. Don&#8217;t hesitate to make a noise complaint to the building owner if living with a roommate is making your ears hurt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving out and living in an apartment can be a liberating experience. You&#8217;re finally out of your parents&#8217; hair, plus you get to stay in the city you&#8217;ve always dreamed about. But there&#8217;s a downside to your newfound freedom. And that&#8217;s using shared living spaces in the property. Part of the reality of being a renter is using a communal kitchen and sharing a bathroom.</p>



<p>Showering and grooming can be a hellish experience depending on your roomis. If you live with slobs, you&#8217;re probably all too familiar with the sight of hair stuck in the drain. Or that mildew building up on the shower curtains. If you&#8217;re the unhygienic roommate, it&#8217;s time to get your act together so you don&#8217;t gross your fellow renters out. Living in an apartment, after all, is all about respecting other people&#8217;s need for clean and safe spaces.</p>

<p>It can be chaotic when everyone&#8217;s scrambling to use the bathroom at the same time each day. When the entire apartment needs to get ready for work or school, your shower schedules are sure to clash.</p>



<p>This problem can easily be solved by coming up with a pre-agreed shower schedule. Set a time for every person to shower and apply a time limit, so no one hogs the bathroom.</p>



<p>When sharing a bathroom, it&#8217;s also important that everyone pitches in to keep it as spotless and germ-free as possible. This is where a cleaning schedule comes in. Take turns cleaning the bathroom at least once a week, using a checklist to make sure all surfaces are properly sanitized. Don&#8217;t skip the jobs everyone hates, here!</p>

<p>On top of the weekly cleaning schedule, it&#8217;s good manners to clean up after using the bathroom. With any shared living spaces, simple acts like wiping surfaces dry go a long way to keeping the area fresh. Store multipurpose spray or wipes under the cabinet, so no one has an excuse not to clean as they go! Some simple maintenance after you shower helps to keep mold and hard water build-up at bay.</p>



<p>Sharing a bathroom also means not leaving any traces of hair behind. For the gentlemen, try using a grooming mat to catch all your mustache and beard trimmings every time you shave. This is a non-slip material you place on top of the sink while you get rid of that five o&#8217;clock shadow. Just dust the hair into a trashcan and you&#8217;re done with cleanup.</p>

<p>Since you&#8217;re sharing a bathroom with roommates, you want to be extra mindful about how much time you spend there. It&#8217;s primarily meant, after all, for essentials like showering and doing your business on the toilet. Consider doing your grooming activities like styling your hair, putting on makeup, and checking out your outfit in your room. Invest in a vanity or full-length mirror so you can carry out your beauty routine there instead of in the shared bathroom.</p>

<p>Sharing a bathroom with roommates can get pretty messy, especially if everyone leaves their body washes, shampoo bottles and toothbrushes lying around. One trick is to buy a shower caddy &#8211; those plastic baskets that hold your stuff. Every time you shower, just bring it with your things inside so they don&#8217;t get mixed in with everyone else&#8217;s.</p>



<p>If the entire home has a caddy, simply hang them up with wall adhesives and label them with names. Now everyone has a place to store their shower essentials.</p>

<p>With shared living spaces, there&#8217;s a big chance that you and your roommates use a lot of the same products &#8211; from shaving gel to hairdryers. Make the most of the space under the sink to store these shared items and make them accessible.</p>



<p>You can find a lot of organizing bins and baskets on Amazon to store things like a pro. Label them with individual names or just write &#8220;everyone&#8221; on the items you&#8217;re happy to share. You can also hang hooks over the door for towels, so you don&#8217;t have to step over wet, dirty towels when sharing a bathroom.</p>

<p>When sharing a bathroom, no one wants to use one that smells disgusting. It&#8217;s particularly awkward and embarrassing if you leave it stinky and a roommate needs to use it right after you.</p>



<p>Scents can do a lot to make using the area more pleasant. Lighting a scented candle, using an aromatic diffuser, or just spritzing a room spray can instantly uplift the bathroom&#8217;s vibe. Try leaving a bag of potpourri to perfume the bathroom. Every time you do number two, you can also use poo sprays to mask those unwanted odors.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to keep sharing a bathroom with roommates that&#8217;s dirty, smelly, and cluttered. But at the end of the day, not everyone is a germophobe or a neat freak. While everyone can agree on rules and responsibilities, there&#8217;s always someone bound to mess up every now and then. Remember to take it easy and don&#8217;t get mad if someone forgets to leave out a fresh roll of toilet paper.</p>

<p>Colors come in different shades, and so do college roommates. This is not unexpected; people are framed differently and have their worldviews (and actions) shaped by their experiences, cultures, and environments. Then, this means you&#8217;ll need different strategies to cope with different kinds of college roommates. In this article, we have characterized 10 different types of college roommates using characters from the Harry Potter series.</p>

<p>Dobby may be a put-down little guy, but he will stay faithful and loyal to anybody that stands with him. In Harry Potter, Dobby has a large heart despite his situation. If he so much as believes in you, he will stand by you even if it is against the norm. Not every roommate becomes a good friend, but one like Dobby will be if you can look beyond his current state.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>Stick your neck out for Dobby and you can be sure he&#8217;ll be there for you, even at his peril.</p>

<p>Cedric is brave and bold. Much more, he believes in fairness and is quite trusting. He will not try to gain an unfair advantage over you, and he will do what he can to return every favor you render to him. He trusts the information that Harry gave him before the first task even when he had no reason to. He also returned the favor before they head to the lake for their second.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>

<p>This type of roommate is not much fun as they are constantly buried in schoolwork. Getting them to go on an outing may be a hassle but you can trust that this one will have your back. There is an additional advantage to having a Hermione; you can be sure your assignments will get done.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>If you have a dorm roommate like this, take advantage of their knowledge to improve yourself. You never know when what you learn passively will be needed.</p>

<p>If you have a roommate like Ginny, there is every tendency that you will feel intimidated because she will be unusually good at everything. But you do not need to be. In Harry Potter, Ginny is compassionate and caring (ask Luna and Neville). She’s also intelligent and strong. This kind of roommate may be shy at first, as Ginny was, but she will bloom into a strong and independent person.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>Enjoy the comfort of being around the all-rounder type of roommate. Maximize your time together by learning as much as you can.</p>

<p>Luna taught us that being different is not wrong. That&#8217;s because she didn’t care about the perception others had of her. Throwing a shade at this kind of roommate won’t get you anywhere. Beyond this weirdness, Luna was brave and loyal to her friends.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>You will learn from this roommate that happiness starts with being yourself regardless of what anybody thinks. This will help your self-esteem greatly.</p>

<p>This one values friendship but will not shy away from telling you the truth if he feels what you are doing is wrong. In Harry Potter, Neville risked the only friends he had at Hogwarts by standing up to them in the Gryffindor common room. He even went as far as to threaten that he would fight them to keep them from sneaking out again.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>We all need someone who we can trust to tell us the truth, even when it hurts. Keep a Neville close for this reason.</p>

<p>A roommate like Dumbledore is so open-minded that they will listen to what you have to say in all situations without first judging. In Harry Potter, Dumbledore&#8217;s mind was so broad that he needed a journal to account for his many thoughts so that he could return to them later.</p>

<p>This kind of roommate has made a few mistakes because they love adventures, and they continue to haunt them. They are often misunderstood and do not feel a need to correct the wrong impressions people have of them. They stick to what they know is right, and even in the face of death, stick by it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>Stick close to this one. He is loyal and will defend you to the last breath.</p>

<p>This kind of roommate is quick to attach labels and fill in the rest of the blanks. So, because Harry Potter is a Potter, he must be brash and act like a blockhead. Ron is a Gryffindor so he must be conceited, and arrogant. Despite the assumptions, they know how to hide their own identities and you will be wrong to label them based on what you see.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>You never really know this kind of roommate because they are masters at hiding their true intentions. The best thing to do around them is to be yourself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 21st century has not only brought in changes in technology but also in social views and traditions. Gone are the days when couples would wait until marriage to cohabitate &#8211; now, it&#8217;s very common to see couple roommates living together long before that. Marvel fans will be familiar with the show WandaVision, which features the Avengers, Wanda and Vision, living together in a suburban area. Here&#8217;s what you can learn from them if you plan on living with your boyfriend/girlfriend soon. Be careful if you&#8217;ve not seen the show yet, though &#8211; this article contains spoilers!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do you know what you&#8217;re getting into?</h2>

<p>Living with your boyfriend/girlfriend is a big deal. There are a lot of things you need to talk about before making the decision to become couple roommates. There needs to be that assurance that both of you are on the same page with virtually everything. Living with another person, no matter how close you are to them, can create sticking points in your relationship. Because of this, it&#8217;s vital to make sure you both know each other&#8217;s boundaries. Ask the important questions regarding budgets and finances, chores, sharing, or whether it&#8217;s the right time. Though fans of the show WandaVision do not really know how Wanda and Vision got together, they must have had some serious talks about their future together offscreen if they decided it was time for them to get married.</p>

<p>Some people may be offended by this question. Of course, you feel strongly for your significant other, otherwise, you wouldn&#8217;t be dating them. But, before you consider living with your boyfriend/girlfriend, you need to be sure of where you both stand in the relationship. Do you both have the same plans for the future? Be clear about how you feel about each other before taking this big step. Wanda and Vision are one of the cutest examples of couple roommates ever. Their chemistry has always been electrifying, both in the comics and on the show. It was clear that they both knew where they stood from the beginning.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Any plans for kids?</h3>

<p>Most people don&#8217;t want to hear the word &#8216;children&#8217;, especially if they&#8217;re still dating. But, if you decide that you&#8217;re ready to start living with your girlfriend/boyfriend, then you may want to (gently!) broach the subject. You can&#8217;t decide for your partner and think they have the same goals as you do. Conversations such as, &#8216;do you want kids?&#8217;, or &#8216;how many kids are we talking about here?&#8217;, need to be had. Having children is a big responsibility in a relationship, and you may disagree on certain things if you don&#8217;t reach a consensus. For example, Wanda and Vision had problems figuring out the name for their baby (which turned out to be twins, but that&#8217;s beside the point!)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pets?</h3>

<p>Apart from dealing with the stress that comes with having children, if that&#8217;s what you decide you both want, you should also talk about pets if you plan on living with your girlfriend/boyfriend. Most children love pets, but they require a lot of care and attention. When Wanda and Vision&#8217;s twins initially asked for a dog, there was a bit of a problem because they didn&#8217;t know if they were ready for one. Do you or do you not want pets? The best thing to do is talk about it.</p>

<p>How do you deal with guests as couple roommates? Do you want to be able to entertain guests? What preparations will you both agree on for when a guest wants to sleepover? When living with your boyfriend/girlfriend, it&#8217;s expected that you&#8217;ll have guests, and you both need to prepare so that you aren&#8217;t stranded when a guest shows up unexpectedly &#8211; just like how Wanda&#8217;s brother, Pietro, shows up in WandaVision.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nosy neighbours</h3>

<p>You may have good neighbours, but there may also be one you can&#8217;t stand. Nobody likes nosy neighbours, but you can&#8217;t escape them. Sometimes, you may encounter a neighbour who wants to be in your business, the way Agatha was in WandaVision. As stated earlier, living with your boyfriend/girlfriend means setting effective boundaries, and you and your partner need to establish some for your potential neighbours.</p>



<p>So there you have it! Moving in with your partner is a big responsibility, but if you do things right, then you can be sure to avoid encountering problems in the future. Good luck!</p>

<p>Having roommates can be good practice for when you eventually become an adult. Whether you are living with a roommate for the first time or you&#8217;re changing roommates, the experience can be awesome!</p>



<p>Sure, clashes may happen. They are bound to, given that you are individuals that share different interests and possibly come from different backgrounds. Sharing WiFi with roommates is one such area where you might come across some problems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Am I a bad person for not wanting to share my WiFi?</h2>



<p>Nah! There are a thousand and one reasons why you may not want to share your WiFi, especially when the requests become incessant. Sometimes it may be that you are on a tight budget and sharing will impact you financially. At other times, it may be that you don&#8217;t see any reason to share when your roommate also has an active internet subscription.</p>



<p>Perhaps you already specified what things and roles you would like shared in your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sign-roommate-agreement/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommates&#8217; agreement</a>. Maybe it is that sharing makes you feel cheated. Whatever the case, not sharing WiFi with your roommate does not make you a bad person.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to know if someone is stealing your WiFi</h2>



<p>Even if you don&#8217;t want to share your WiFi, if you&#8217;re not careful, your roommate can still access it. Here are three ways you can recognize if someone is stealing your WiFi</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Check your indicator light</h3>



<p>This is perhaps the easiest way to know if someone has unauthorized access to your WiFi. If your router’s light is on even when all your wireless devices are off, then you know that someone has hacked into your WiFi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Check your router’s device list</h3>



<p>Type in the specified router IP address into your browser. Once you are logged in, look for ‘Attached devices’ or ‘Device list’. If you notice any IP address other than yours on the list, then someone is using your WiFi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Check your security settings</h3>



<p>If you notice that your roommate is sharing your WiFi without authorization, then you may need to make your device more secure. You can do this by utilizing the WPA2 or WPS security alongside a complex password which you must update regularly.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with sharing your WiFi as long as it doesn&#8217;t become an incessant or everyday thing. So by all means, go ahead. However, should the sharing request from your roomi become frequent, consider asking your roommate to contribute to the subscription from the outset. If you are both going to pay, then have some form of agreement on usage proportions, because chances are that your internet consumption won&#8217;t be the same.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges to expect when sharing WiFi with roommates</h2>



<p>Several challenges arise when more than one person is using the same internet connection. Some of the most common points to tackle when you&#8217;re sharing WiFi with your roommates are listed below.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Network speed</h3>



<p>Network speed slows down dramatically when more than one person is connected to it. This is especially true when the individual is engaged in a bandwidth-draining activity like online gaming or video streaming. You can fix this by choosing an internet provider with more bandwidth. The more the bandwidth, the less the lag and the faster your browsing experience will be.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Security</h3>



<p>That you are sharing with your roommate alone does not mean the network is not visible to your neighbors. This means that others can as well try to access your internet connection even without authorization. This means that you must encrypt your wireless signals to prevent unauthorized access. Set up a password that no one can guess!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Illegal activities</h3>



<p>If your network provider detects any <a href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/wi-fi-network-criminal-liability.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlawful activity on your service</a>, the bandwidth will be throttled until the illegal activity stops. Unfortunately, only the person whose name is on the wireless network contract can be held responsible. Make it clear in advance that illegal activity is not acceptable, in a roommate agreement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can my roommate see my messages when we share the WiFi?</h2>



<p>Not possible. They may be able to check what apps or websites you’re browsing sometimes, but they would not be able to see your activity on the apps or website. This is because most internet connections and apps are encrypted to make them secure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bottom line</h2>



<p>Whether you choose to share your internet with your roommate or not, ensure you discuss it. If you can&#8217;t, make your reasons clear. And if you can share, have that discussion and agree on who pays what, when, and how this will affect usage. This will go a long way to ensure that sharing your WiFi with your roommate (or not) doesn&#8217;t become a reason for an argument.</p>

<p>There’s nothing like sharing food with roommates to help build a stronger bond. While food can help bring people together, it can just as easily drive a wedge in your amicable relationship with your roommate. Living with a roommate involves establishing boundaries, and let’s face it, most of us aren’t very good at that. So, Roomi is here to help you navigate your way through the ins and outs of sharing food when you’re co-living.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Starting the conversation: who goes first?</h2>



<p>Although food is a big part of everyone’s lives, no one really thinks about it until they start living alone. Who knew that midnight snack cravings could be so expensive? As you venture into adulthood and budgeting (yikes), it&#8217;s important to track your expenses, and your roommate stealing your food usually isn&#8217;t part of the plan.</p>



<p>Before move-in day, ensure that you&#8217;ve ironed out all the finer details of living together, including food and grocery responsibilities. If your roommate hasn’t brought it up yet, don’t hesitate to start the conversation yourself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What should you discuss?</h2>



<p>If you’re in a co-living situation with multiple roommates, include everyone in the discussion. Whether you want to have a “roommate meeting” or discuss over text, you&#8217;ll need to keep a few points in mind.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what to discuss:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>What are the staple items that you’ll share?</li><li>What’s the best way to split the bill?</li><li>How should you designate ‘special’ food items that are off limits?</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Good roommate etiquette: Ask and ye shall receive</h2>



<p>We all have cravings sometimes, or simply want to try something new. Set a good example by asking your roommate if you want to try something they’ve bought for themselves. It’s easier to ask first than to apologize later. By setting a good example of simply asking your roommate for their food, it ensures that they do the same for you. Want to earn extra brownie points? Be quick about replacing what you ate or buy them their favorite snack to compensate!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Save your receipts!</h2>



<p>Decided to have a few common staple items? Ensure that you save the receipts! It can be difficult to keep track of how much everyone needs to chip in. Hence, it’s best to save the receipts. Stick the receipt on your fridge and have people write or cross out their names once they’ve paid their share. Not only does it serve as a quick reminder for everyone, but also makes it easier to keep track of payments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">To label or not to label?</h2>



<p>When you’ve not had a proper discussion about sharing food with roommates, it can be hard to know whether you should label your food items. You may think it’s rude to label all food items, and much easier to share the food amongst yourselves. Unfortunately, this can quickly lead to conflicts and arguments.</p>



<p>If you’ve already had a discussion about staple food items to be shared, you only need to label the food items that are the exception. In case you’ve decided not to share any food items, ensure that you label everything you buy &#8211; unless it’s something that you’re comfortable sharing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Try cooking together!</h2>



<p>While it isn’t feasible to cook every meal together, you can plan weekly or monthly dinners where you cook with your roommates. Not only is it a great roommate bonding activity, but it can also end up being much cheaper than trying to cook for yourself!</p>



<p>Go out to the shops and plan what you want to cook, and split the cost right away rather than leaving it for later. Keep everyone’s food habits and allergies in mind while you create a fun meal to enjoy together. It is an excellent way to catch up with your roommates, as well as indulge in some home-cooked dishes for a change!</p>

<p>If you dream about having a roommate relationship like Ted and Marshall from How I met Your Mother, you must take our living advice seriously! Both of them made living with roommates look like a cakewalk, and honestly, it can be only if you set your priorities and boundaries in place! Your roommate left the empty milk carton in the fridge; what would you do pick from the options below:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>I would call them and scream about it, this is unacceptable.</li><li>Or I would get a new one, add the expenses to the app which helps us settle the bill, and then remind them that they forgot to throw away the old carton.</li><li>I would start labeling grocery/food, I take my cereal very seriously!</li></ol>



<p>If you found peace with option 1, we would politely ask you not to dream about having a tight bond like Ted and Marshall.</p>



<p>If option 2 would be your way to handle the situation, we are very proud of you! Let&#8217;s find Ted to your Marshall!</p>



<p>Option 3 is not all that bad, but could be used eventually if your roommate keeps on repeating the same mistake!</p>



<p><strong>Find your perfect +1 for exploring the city you are planning to move to. With us, it&#8217;s always a match! </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;ve watched the show &#8216;Friends&#8217;, you should be no stranger to Joey and Chandler and their roommate relationship. In fact, many of us grew up watching Friends and dreaming of living with roommates in NYC and having adventures. Roommate-based TV shows give us a romanticized view of life with roommates. However, there is also a lot to learn from them about apartment rules and living with a roommate. Read on as we look at Joey and Chandler and the lessons on apartment living from this iconic roommate duo.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find the right roommate</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/LoJwuxdKYJ1ja"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/LoJwuxdKYJ1ja/giphy.gif?resize=500%2C245&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="500" height="245" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>In Friends, we see Chandler search for a new roommate when Joey moves into a new, swanky apartment. While at the supermarket, he meets Eddie, who later moves in with Chandler as his new roommate. However, Eddie and Chandler have nothing in common and struggle to get along as roommates. Eddie hates Baywatch, foosball, and sports, steals mannequins from Macy&#8217;s, and dehydrates fruit for fun. Furthermore, when Eddie&#8217;s ex-girlfriend Tilly comes by to drop off his old, empty goldfish tank, he becomes suspicious of Chandler. He believes that Chandler slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.</p>



<p>After several mishaps and confrontations, Chandler finally manages to rid himself of Eddie. Hence, the moral here is to make sure you find someone who is the right fit if you are planning on living with a roommate! They are a huge part of apartment life and can make or break the experience.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set and follow apartment rules</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/good-job-2HMUYBYrhg4Gk"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/2HMUYBYrhg4Gk/giphy.gif?resize=281%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt=" - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="281" height="200" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Not everyone will appreciate you building a cardboard box fort in the living room! And there is a lot to learn not to do from Joey as well. Furthermore, no one likes a messy or noisy roommate who doesn&#8217;t do their fair share of the household chores. Be sure that you have a clearly laid out and agreed-upon set of apartment rules and responsibilities. Taking out the trash, washing the dishes, and paying bills are all shared responsibilities.</p>



<p>Additionally, you&#8217;ll avoid conflict if you have your apartment rules clearly laid out while living with a roommate. Also, don&#8217;t forget the most important rule; &#8220;Joey doesn’t share food!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Accept your roommates for who they are</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/friends-milk-joey-tribbiani-BLZVQ73Gl53Ak"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/BLZVQ73Gl53Ak/giphy.gif?resize=450%2C327&#038;ssl=1" alt="Joey Tribbiani Friends GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="450" height="327" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>When living with a roommate, there are going to be peculiar habits that you may notice and even find annoying. For example, in Friends, Joey and Chandler have their differences and still manage to go past them and live together. There is no perfect roommate, but it&#8217;s about finding the thing you both love and accepting each other.</p>



<p>Maybe you think a big white dog statue is an eyesore and a waste of space. However, it&#8217;s all about accepting their different tastes and opinions while living with a roommate. Even if your roommate is a bit immature or messy like Joey, a bit obsessive like Monica. Besides, Chandler has seen it all and still managed to get along and live with both of them!</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Looking for a roommate? Here are some qualities to look for!</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Occasional conflicts are a part of living with roommates</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/Friends-friends-season-5-tv-dAuumiq85i5evf5UVY"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/dAuumiq85i5evf5UVY/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Not Listening Season 5 GIF by Friends - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="400" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Living with a roommate means that you are bound to have disagreements from time to time. For instance, maybe your roommate has done something that annoys you, or you can&#8217;t seem to agree on something. Remember that even iconic roommate duos like Joey and Chandler have conflicts sometimes. Moreover, it&#8217;s about overcoming these disagreements and making peace that teaches us great lessons about living with a roommate. Even if your roommate might think it&#8217;s funny to wear everything you own, with no underwear on.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, communication and forgiveness are key to getting over issues you have while living with roommates. Furthermore, you should never hold a grudge and move on, much like when Chandler kissed Joey’s girlfriend and offered to sit in a wooden box until Joey forgave him.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Friends in need are friends indeed!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/tvland-friends-recliner-friendsontvland-r728rYRDDKzp6"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/r728rYRDDKzp6/giphy.gif?resize=400%2C225&#038;ssl=1" alt="Reclining Best Friends GIF by TV Land Classic - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="400" height="225" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>A roommate is much more than just someone you bump into from time to time. In fact, they are one of the closest friends you&#8217;ll have away from home and living in NYC like in Friends. Joey and Chandler showed us that you can go from strangers to the best of friends. Moreover, being one of the most iconic duos from roommate-based TV shows means there is a lot to learn from them. A roommate is always there for you and has your back. Whether you&#8217;re upset, heartbroken, in trouble, or want to kick back and watch some Baywatch!</p>



<p>Besides, it&#8217;s always great to have someone to help around, like when you need to pivot a giant bed to get it up the stairs. How Joey and Chandler knew each other and what troubled the other person so well are roommate goals! Joey and Chandler were also willing to help their other friends and give their all. Just like that one time Monica got stung by a jellyfish at the beach.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Remember to have fun!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dancing-friends-cV5s29FfjZOkU"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/cV5s29FfjZOkU/giphy.gif?resize=318%2C212&#038;ssl=1" alt="Friends Dancing GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="318" height="212" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Living in NYC and trying to manage your work can be stressful and difficult. Therefore, it is important to have a roommate who can remind you to take a break and have fun. Joey and Chandler on Friends are always ready to have some fun or take a break from the stress of life. Even though Joey and Chandler weren&#8217;t always great at giving advice, they were there for each other.</p>



<p>Similarly, just being there and willing to have some fun is sometimes all you need from a roommate when you&#8217;re feeling down. Joey and Chandler are always able to put a smile on people’s faces. Whether it is with their jokes, pranks, or occasionally by accident.</p>
