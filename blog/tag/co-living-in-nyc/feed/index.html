										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you traverse the net in search of a room share in NYC and potential roommates, you’re going to come across a lot of different styles of ads. Some will be from legit people looking for a good situation. Others . . . not so much. Here is a helpful guide on<a href="https://www.spareroom.co.uk/content/info-tenants/safety-tips-for-room-seekers/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> what to look for</a> in room share ads in NYC, for peaceful co living. Also, you can assess whether the person is for real or up so something shady.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lookout for price points in room share ads  </strong></h2>



<p>Are they reasonable rates, or to good to be true? <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you see low rent for co living in NYC, it can feel like wandering the Sahara desert for forty days and forty nights and stumbling into an oasis. Your heart races, your eyes grow wide, and with a wild whoop of joy, you race towards it, exhaustion forgotten.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in the cartoons, this always turns out to be a mirage. And the over-eager wanderer ends up with a mouthful of sand.</span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="679" data-attachment-id="10985" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/underrated-nyc-neighborhoods/attachment/best-neighborhood-nyc/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1246&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1880,1246" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="best-neighborhood-nyc" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?fit=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=1024%2C679&#038;ssl=1" alt="apartment in NYC" class="wp-image-10985" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1018&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, room share in NYC is crazy expensive. But the rates are that high because supply and <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/lc/resources/home/articles/rental-tips-for-first-time-renters" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">demand allow it</a>. With a strong emphasis on demand. New York is so incredibly awesome, so rich in opportunity, that people are willing to pay through the nose to live in one of the greatest cities on Earth.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To end, there are two lessons here, really. One. Don’t wander around deserts without water, a map, and a camel. That’s just science. Two. If someone is posting really low rent for a room share, you should be very, very cautious. There’s a good chance they’re up to no good.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Room Share Ads Details: Quantity Has A Quality All Its Own</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s compare two different room share ads in NYC. One says, “Brooklyn. $1000 a month. Got floors. A window. Thanks.” Okaaay. Clearly, not super detailed. Hopefully, the ceiling is included with this amazing package deal. The other ad has offered lots of helpful info about the lease, stressed the roommate’s co living rules, and added a few free-written paragraphs about the room. Like this </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/rooms-for-rent/Brooklyn/rPQr5w7bZ?source=local" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well written <span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Roomi. Nice! Lot’s more information here.</span></p>

<p>Further, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he obvious advantage is that you can get a better understanding of the room. Similarly, of the co living situation. Yet, there’s a second, less obvious reason to go for the well written room share ad in NYC and avoid the sparse one. The person who wrote a detailed ad was willing to invest their time.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do details in room share ads make co living in NYC better?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone isn’t willing to put in a little effort to write up a complete room share ad, what’s that say about them? Truly, they don’t seem very respectful of your time. They expect you to do all the work which makes finding rooms for co living exhausting. Heck, they may even be hiding something. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would explain why they are treating their room share ad like an interview with the police and offering as little information as possible. Not good signs. So always look for well written, detailed, complete room share ads in NYC that show the individual is honest and willing to put some effort in to make you feel at home.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So ten pictures are worth, like, ten thousand words. Throw in twenty pictures, and we’ve got a novella. If an room share in NYC ad reads well and the price is right, but there aren’t any photos, buyer beware. However, this isn’t to say there needs to be hundreds of photos to qualify as a good room share ad. For instance, there could be five photographs in the room share ad, chosen from helpful angles.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, this determines what your co living life in NYC could look like!</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should get a sense of the entryway, the main room, the bedroom if it has one, bathroom, and kitchen, at the very least. If there are fifty pictures of the main room and not a single one of where you’ll be sleeping, then approach with extreme caution. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe they didn’t take a picture of the bedroom because if they opened the door, all the stacks of pizza boxes and ramen noodles cups would tumble out. Also, the cockroach colony hates that because they labored for days to arrange it all into a miniaturized village.</span> Forget co living, you definitely wouldn&#8217;t want to live there in any way!</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey. It’s New York. Anything could happen.</span> </p>
