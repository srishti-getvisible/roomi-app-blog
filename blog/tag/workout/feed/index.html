<p>From late-night binging to early morning workout sessions, there&#8217;s no better partner-in-crime than your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/science-roommate-makes-happier/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate</a>. Especially since most of us now have to work from home, exercise is something that the entire household can do together. And since the holiday season has passed,  we&#8217;re all left a particularly unwanted present, namely, the dreadful holiday weight! If health &amp; fitness is on your mind, we have just the exercise routines for you to get you started while working from home. Remember, all awesome things take time! So be consistent, patient, and strict with your workout schedule. And we promise that your hard work will bring you closer to your &#8216;physically fit&#8217; goal every day! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should I exercise with my roommates as I work from home?</h2>



<p>Health &amp; fitness can be super boring to some, at least in the cold winter months when lazing around seems like the best option. However, nothing is more motivating than to have your friends/roommates join you in your attempt to add some exercise to your routine as you work from home. There&#8217;s something really comforting to see your friend sweat and slog alongside you.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Friendly competition can be a good thing when you are&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.self.com/fitness/workouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working out</a>&nbsp;because it will push you further than you would on your own. Doing this total body workout with a friend will motivate you try to keep pace with them and in turn make you complete more rounds of work than if you are doing it by yourself.&#8221; </em></p><cite><strong><em>Mat Forzaglia, Fitness Professional</em></strong></cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a good total body exercise routine to start with as I work from home?</h2>



<p>We have a great total workout routine that even beginners will enjoy. We like to call it 5 under 10, as there are 5 exercises under 10mins. It&#8217;s great for  those who have just started to exercise while working from home.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do I exercise properly as I work from home? </h2>



<p>Work from home is stressful enough as it is, don&#8217;t let your exercise routine make it worse. So, take it easy. Often times newbies who are enthusiastic about health &amp; fitness, end up doing exercises improperly. This results in muscle damage and injuries. To prevent such mishaps, let&#8217;s look at the correct way of doing the exercises in our 5 under 10 routine:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It looks like it&#8217;s going to be a long winter. The best adjustment you can make to your health routine while working from home is to start the day with some strength, flexibility and cardio exercises. If you do them before breakfast, you get your metabolism (and your productivity) fired up for the day. The best way to stay focused is to keep changing your workout routine, so why not take advantage of the space in your apartment and create a home gym? After all, you don&#8217;t need fancy equipment to have the best (and cheap) home gym around!</p>



<p> If the idea of working out in the comfort of your own home and saving money on fitness memberships sounds good, here are some tips to follow when setting up a home gym. Trainers all around the world swear by these 7 pieces of gear to make every home gym effective. Are you ready to work up a sweat?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. A mat</h2>



<p>This is not only the best, but also a cheap home gym equipment that you need to get started. There are two variations of mats available;&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=yoga+mat&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=thrillist0d-20&amp;linkId=d2660bec63d6e79ef26c63da1bba9a88&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">a yoga mat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/33tJyOO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a jump mat</a>. The latter is a bit thicker, and is used for much more intensive exercises. A jump mat can also double as a yoga mat if you prefer a little more cushioning.</p>



<p>Work out in your bedroom if you have the space (and want to Downward Dog in private) or convert your living room into a workout space with a few quick changes. Shift your furniture to the side to give your mat some space, and then you can binge-watch Netflix while you exercise. Just make sure your roommates are on-board with the set-up first.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Resistance bands</h2>



<p>Resistance bands are core pieces of equipment for a home gym. They take up very little space, and are versatile and cost-effective. They come in various resistance levels, so you will always have new ways to challenge yourself. Regardless of what you do, make sure you have a structured plan that covers all parts of the body, instead of doing a few reps of bicep curls or lunges, here or there.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Jump rope</h2>



<p>Every home gym needs a good licorice&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.verywellfit.com/best-jump-rope-4158057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jump rope</a>. A jump rope helps supplement workouts and keeps your feet moving when you might not get a full workout. There are many cheap jump ropes available for beginner exercises, and even advanced variations if you feel like taking your skipping to the next level. It&#8217;s a cheap addition to your home gym, but boy is it worth it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Dumbbells</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking to break out of bodyweight exercises all day, a set of dumbbells is just what you need. Storing them is pretty simple &#8211; keep them under the bed when you finish working out. Adjustable dumbbells add a little more heat to your routine., giving you the ability to go light or go heavy. The easiest way to keep challenging your body from workout to workout is to add more load and weight to the exercise. If you have the extra room, you can even get yourself&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=adjustable+dumbbells&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=thrillist0d-20&amp;linkId=29a894fa31fcb5728b788f904e2e615a&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">adjustable weights</a>&nbsp;for your dumbbells.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Pull-up bar</h2>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/10-best-pull-up-bars-of-2020/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">pull up bar</a>&nbsp;is one of the basics for a full home gym. If you&#8217;re new to pull-ups, you&#8217;ll likely feel like giving up quickly when you set up the bar and pump out. Even if you&#8217;re hardly moving, stay with it, as pull-ups are a great way to strengthen your upper body and core. The more you use the pull-up bar, the faster you&#8217;ll see results. You can easily attach the pull-up bar to your door frame without taking away from your limited floor space. Just do a pull-up every time you pass by, and you&#8217;ll see results in no time.</p>
