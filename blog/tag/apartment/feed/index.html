<p>Clutter. A pretty-looking word, but not a pretty sight. Sometimes in life, we all come face to face with it. When we&#8217;re too lazy to keep things neat and tidy, or when we&#8217;re moving apartments. Or if we&#8217;re simply messy by nature. In this article, we&#8217;re going to talk about how to declutter your home, and whether it&#8217;s even meant for you. If it is, then you&#8217;ll find some helpful tips on how to declutter your apartment with the help of Dana White&#8217;s book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35540769-decluttering-at-the-speed-of-life" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decluttering at the speed of life</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">To each their own when it comes to being messy</h2>



<p>Before going in, we want to talk subjectively about clutter in the apartment. On one hand, there&#8217;s ongoing research that suggests messy people are more creative. As psychologist <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/opinion/sunday/its-not-mess-its-creativity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Kathleen Vohs tells the New York Times</a>, <strong><em>&#8220;being around messiness would lead people away from convention, in favor of new directions.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.mic.com/p/are-messy-people-really-more-creative-21783421" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nancy Irwin, another psychologist talks to Mic</a>, <strong><em>“If one truly believes their creativity comes from clutter, then they may only feel creative in their messy environment. This is the placebo effect, and mess has no real neurological benefit on creativity in and of itself.”</em></strong></p>



<p>In conclusion, this argument is &#8230; a mess in itself too.</p>



<p>Which is why, we want to tell you that it&#8217;s your life, and your space. So do whatever makes you feel at home, in your home!</p>



<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got that off of our chest, let&#8217;s see some ways to declutter your home in the best way possible, even if it&#8217;s in a messy way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is clutter to you?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>I define clutter as anything I can’t keep under control. If a space in my home consistently gets out of control, I have too much stuff in that space. I have clutter. </p><cite>Dana White</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>What do you define as clutter then? Is it just a messy way to keep all the things that are of use to you? And how does it make you feel? If you do feel overwhelmed every time you look at that particular space. Or if you don&#8217;t use anything from the messy pile of clutter on your table, then it&#8217;s surely time to declutter your apartment.</p>



<p>But on the other hand, if the mess is something you like to look at, or if the chaos drives your creativity, and you use things from the mess almost every day, then you don&#8217;t really need to declutter your home. It&#8217;s all a matter of what you want to live with, and what you just can&#8217;t.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do you have space for the clutter or do you NEED to declutter your home?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Accept the limitations of the space you have, and declutter enough that your stuff fits comfortably in that space. </p><cite>Dana White</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>What makes messy living extremely overwhelming is if you have a small space that hosts clutter like uninvited guests. So as Dana White says in Decluttering at the speed of life, you need to accept the limitations of your space. Even if you like a messy environment, make sure it doesn&#8217;t completely block your open spaces around the room. And if it does, it&#8217;s time to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/apps-to-sell-used-goods-online-and-declutter-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">declutter your home</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hoarding isn&#8217;t organizing</h2>



<p>We know, this one stings. But it&#8217;s the truth. And we all struggle with it when we sit to declutter our home. Some things are too pretty to throw away and we understand. But the problem is, keep one pretty thing, and soon it becomes boxes and boxes of things that you don&#8217;t know what to do with when you sit to declutter your apartment. However, you still <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/is-your-roommate-a-slob-or-a-hoarder-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">want to hoard</a> things, in hopes for an idea to come knocking on the box&#8217;s door.</p>



<p>But as Dana White says in Decluttering at the speed of life:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Keep Boxes don’t work. They let me put off making a final decision. I can temporarily place a particularly difficult item inside, confident that the future version of me will know what to do with it. Future Me doesn’t deserve that much credit, and honestly, she doesn’t appreciate the pressure. </p><cite>Dana White</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>So do your future self a favor, sing along with Elsa, and LET IT GO, LET IT GOOOOO to declutter your home!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep the interesting stuff going when you declutter your home</h2>



<p>If your clutter is made up of interesting things that add value to your life in any way, keep them. What you need to know is the distinction between what you compulsively hoard, and the stuff that actually makes you happy when you declutter your apartment.</p>



<p>Because as Dana White says in Decluttering at the speed of life</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>A common trait among people who struggle with clutter: they’re interesting, and they like interesting stuff.</p><cite>Dana White</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>So to declutter your home in the best way possible, find a healthy balance, like in every other aspect of life, and you have nothing to worry about. Most importantly, do whatever makes you feel comfortable and free in your space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living with roommates is more than just split bills, rent and space. Unfortunately, this closeness brings with it a higher risk of transmitted infection during the pandemic. One of the most significant disagreements that roommates have in their cramped apartments is how to correctly social distance. Whatever your relationship with those humans you live with, establishing these 5 key rules can help you reduce both physical contact &#8211; and heated conflict.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Discuss boundaries while living with roommates</h2>



<p>Boundaries take on a new meaning and are critically important in a time like this. It may be that you and your roommate disagree on quiet hours and cleaning regimens during &#8220;normal&#8221; life, but a pandemic calls for some necessary changes. It&#8217;s healthy to maintain open communication with your roommates regarding social distancing and person-to-person interactions.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="281" data-attachment-id="10496" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/taking-coronavirus-precautions-with-roommates-roomi/attachment/pandemic-rules/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pandemic-rules.gif?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,281" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pandemic-rules" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pandemic-rules.gif?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pandemic-rules.gif?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pandemic-rules.gif?resize=500%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="roommates establishing boundaries during a pandemic" class="wp-image-10496"/></figure></div>



<p>Due to the health hazard that coronavirus presents, you and your roommates must read from the same page regarding social distancing and sanitizing. You can openly talk to your roommate if you feel uncomfortable with the idea of them stepping out often and meeting people for leisure. </p>



<p>One common problem is having to deal with your roommate&#8217;s significant other spending more time in your apartment. Be honest and open about your apprehensions with your roommate. It&#8217;s a good idea to set a few healthy boundaries while living with roommates so that both of you feel secure in your home.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Make a pact to stay home</h2>



<p>Being serious about staying home means no family visits, no vacations, and no balcony parties. You can consider putting it down in a roommate agreement for the benefit of all your housemates. If your roommates do not take this seriously, explain the consequences to them. The coronavirus pandemic doesn&#8217;t look at age, gender, or financial stability. It can happen to anyone &#8211; regardless of where they live and what their living situation is like. The least you can do for yourself and the people around you is practice social distancing and regularly sanitize your hands whenever you go out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Come up with a contingency plan to stay safe </h2>



<p>Be prepared in advance! You should devise a contingency plan in case any of you gets affected by the coronavirus. Even if you&#8217;re practicing strict safety measures, it&#8217;s still possible to contract the virus, especially if one of you is an essential worker.</p>

	</div>
	


<p>Think about what you&#8217;ll do&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-to-do-if-your-roommate-has-covid-symptoms-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">if someone falls ill</a>? Will this person&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-to-do-if-your-roommate-has-covid-symptoms-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarantine</a>&nbsp;in his or her bedroom? What about washroom visits? Will this person be allowed kitchen visits? Or will a roommate leave meals outside their bedroom door?</p>



<p>This conversation while living with roommates could be uncomfortable and scary, but it&#8217;s necessary. If you have a small apartment, your plan needs to be very creative, possibly with one roommate leaving the apartment altogether. The conversation should include finances; maintain an open dialogue with your landlord and consider requesting a payment extension if you&#8217;re facing financial issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Living with roommates calls for a cleaning schedule</h2>



<p>With COVID-19 pandemic raging, promote new routines, especially if your roommates go weeks without Clorox. Choose one day of the week to&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/deep-clean-and-sanitize-your-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep clean and disinfect</a>&nbsp;and share the responsibility while living with roommates.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to designate a space for dirty shoes, clothes, and items. You can immediately remove all your keys, phone, shoes, and clothes as you come back from the supermarket and prevent bacteria from tracking the entire apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Designate individual spaces for work</h2>



<p>Some roommates in the apartment may be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doorsteps.com/articles/working-from-home-without-a-home-office-6-ways-to-maximize-productivity" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">working from home</a>, and it&#8217;s wise to designate a suitable workspace in your apartment.</p>



<p>If someone is continuously on their phone, it may be worthwhile to give them a room with a door. You may also need to establish quiet hours. Try to keep an open mind and remain flexible, as the pandemic situation is temporary and will soon subside.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For those that are contemplating making the move to LA, the only informing factor to all following decisions should be the fact that Los Angeles is gigantic, enormous, and huge. Besides being massive, LA is also at an average of $640,000 for a typical home, having a growing number of people unable to buy a home. The only resolve to their situation then becomes renting an apartment in Los Angeles. More than half the people in Los Angeles are renting properties, making it the fourth-highest percentage of renters in the nation.</p>



<p>Check out our Roomi rent report to find out more about average <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-december-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">room prices in the U.S.</a> in December 2020.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>According to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zumper&#8217;s National Rent Report</a> &#8211; LA maintains its spot in the top ten most expensive cities to rent in the US &#8211; with the average rent for a one-bedroom at $2,020 &amp; a two-bedroom at $2,820.</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But what is the rental process like when you&#8217;re ready to make the move to LA? What are the steps following your decision to be renting in Los Angeles? What are some of the things you should consider when finding an apartment in the city of angels? </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide to finding your space in Los Angeles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Questions to ask yourself when searching for an apartment to rent in Los Angeles.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s</strong> <strong>your budget?</strong></h3>



<p>Answer the defining questions first. By that we mean, try looking up the latest median costs for the apartment size <em>that&#8217;s best for you</em>. </p>



<p>For instance, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apartment List</a> states the median rent for a one-bedroom in LA to be $1545 and $2027 for a two-bedroom. </p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve decided on your budget, <strong>do not forget to take into account the security deposit, first (and probably last) month&#8217;s rent, and an application fee of up to $50.</strong> (Note: Some landlords demand that your income be thrice the amount of your total rent).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What neighborhood is best for me to be renting in Los Angeles?</strong></h3>



<p>The best bet you can make for (sort of ) easy living in an apartment in LA, is picking a house close to where you work. At peak rush hour, it takes over two hours on a bus to get from one end of the town to another. If you&#8217;re unable to find a neighborhood close to work, try looking for a neighborhood that falls close to a well-connected bus route. Additionally, it should also not be far enough to become an expensive cab ride on a tipsy night.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/lol-la-thumbs-up-3o752gga17aO8OlQWI"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/3o752gga17aO8OlQWI/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Los Angeles Lol GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are my options besides apartment finding websites?</h3>



<p>With websites like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi</a>, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Zillow</a>, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://zumper.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zumper,</a> you wouldn&#8217;t need to hire a realtor. But oftentimes, once you&#8217;ve left for a search in an area, it can be quite beneficial to search for other properties in that area, on foot. This is a method that has proved effective for numerous people. Since landlords prefer renting to locals, you&#8217;re more likely to stumble on a place that isn&#8217;t listed online.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is renting an apartment in Los Angeles different from New York City?</h2>



<p>While you probably wouldn&#8217;t have exhausted the same energy as you would when apartment hunting in New York. Be it a steeper budget or a coveted neighborhood, you might just find yourself unable to find your dream oasis, when renting an apartment in Los Angeles is your goal. And that&#8217;s okay. You might just need to manage your expectations better. Considering, well, <a href="https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/rates.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the vacancy rate in LA</a> is at 3.9% right now, and bidding wars for rentals don&#8217;t just get ugly on TV.</p>



<p><em>Several <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.realtor.com/advice/rent/why-right-now-is-prime-time-for-negotiating-rent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">surveys</a> indicate that tenants renting in Los Angeles have more leverage during the winter months &#8211; making them the ideal time to move. Fewer people are concerned with moving amidst cold or bad weather, so you are likely to find better deals when it&#8217;s cold outside.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Things to know when you&#8217;re visiting an apartment you could be potentially renting in Los Angeles.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/thehills-the-hills-104-l2JdTy6mg3vViNwUU"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/l2JdTy6mg3vViNwUU/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C324&#038;ssl=1" alt="Los Angeles La GIF by The Hills - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="324" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>When you&#8217;ve finally come across a couple or more apartments that you like, take a day out to review them in person. You&#8217;ll likely be dealing with the apartment manager, the landlord, or a management company. </p>



<p>Some things you should be on the lookout for are:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Holes in the corners of the room?!</h4>



<p>These are common, and they most definitely indicate a bug infestation. Take this up with the building manager before you move in, and if you really like the place, request a deep clean and fixes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Do not be alarmed if you don&#8217;t see a fridge or a stove!</h4>



<p>Some landlords in LA just don&#8217;t provide one and you may need to bring your own.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other questions you must ask when looking at the apartment you may be renting in Los Angeles.</h4>



<p>Is the parking suitable for your needs? What about the place&#8217;s pet policy? Is there a pet deposit? Just some questions you don&#8217;t want to be looking for answers for <em>after signing a lease.</em></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">If you&#8217;ve found an apartment in LA that you would like to rent, should you apply right away?</h3>



<p>As mentioned before, the market is very tight. It is recommended that you submit an application the moment you find a place you like. </p>



<p>Getting your dream oasis, especially in Los Angeles often comes down to two things: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Being the first one to apply. </li><li>Having a good credit score. </li></ul>



<p>Keeping your previous landlord&#8217;s info, employer&#8217;s reference and bank statements handy will also help you speed up the process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Rent Control for apartments in Los Angeles like?</h2>



<p>Rent Control essentially keeps a check on how much your rent is raised every year. Everyone calls it <em>Rent Control</em>, but the concept in itself is referred to as <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hcidla2.lacity.org/tag/rent-stabilization-ordinance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">rent stabilization.</a> </p>



<p>This basically means two things &#8211; one, over the longer term, tenants in rent-controlled units end up paying less, and two, these units come with protection measures for tenants who are evicted unfairly.</p>



<p>There is rent control in other cities of LA County as well. However, the measures might differ.

Not to mention decorating a new apartment can often mean digging deep into those pockets. But hold on, we&#8217;re here so you barely need to stress to make your new apartment feel like home!</p>



<p>Here are 8 tips to help make your new apartment feel more like home.</p>

<p>This is a super easy, affordable way to brighten up your apartment. Hanging string lights has become an increasingly popular room decor trend &#8211; and for good reason!<br>Buy a few strands of fairy lights and brighten up any space in your apartment that is looking bare. Check out Target or Home Goods for affordable string lights and decor. Get even more creative and hang up small photographs or polaroids on your string of lights using clothespins!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buy house plants! The more the merrier!</h2>

<p>Decorating your apartment with plants is both visually pleasing and budget-friendly! <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-be-a-great-plant-parent-this-fall-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop at your local grocery store and pick up a few of your favorite potted plants.</a> No worries if you don’t have a green thumb, artificial plants will do the trick too! This is also one of the easiest ways to make your apartment feel like home. Plants do a great job at cozying up a place, that is if you&#8217;re committed to taking care of them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Decorate walls with art that represents you.</h2>

<p>Make sure to include personal photographs in various rooms in order to make your new place feel homier. Photographs give us a sense of comfort and help us to feel connected with family and friends even if we aren’t physically with them. Invest in a few cute frames and hang your favorite pictures on a bare wall to give it some life.</p>

<p>Pick out a color scheme for a particular room and add decorative pillows and throws to make the room pop. If your room is looking bland, add a few colorful or patterned pillows to the room! Fuzzy throws are also a great addition to any couch or chair to make a room feel cozier. There’s no such thing as too many blankets!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Invest in a nice rug, maybe two. Or three. ?</h2>

<p>Decide what room you’ll be spending the most time in (for example, your living room) and invest in a good quality rug. Do your research and find a reputable company so your rug will last. If you’re striving for a clean and modern look for your apartment, decorating with a white or grey rug would be a great addition to any living room, and the neutral tones will never go out of style!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hang curtains, blinds, or shades. Whatever fits your aesthetic best! </h2>

<p>Hanging curtains is a perfect way to make any apartment feel homier. Once you’ve decided on your color scheme, decide what color curtains would go best in your apartment. Not only are curtains aesthetically pleasing, but they offer insulation and help keep in heat during the colder months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Put candles on display, and play with as much light as your can.</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Apartment hunting is no easy feat.&nbsp;Once you’ve finally found a place that’s within your budget, close to public transportation, and home to an awesome roommate, you’ll probably just want to get on with having signed a lease agreement and call it a day — but not so fast. Did you make sure to thoroughly examine the place for any red flags? Unless you take the time to check that everything is in working order — particularly in older apartment buildings — you could be setting yourself up for some serious problems down the road. So before signing a lease,&nbsp;run through this checklist of apartment features you have to inspect first.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Check for a properly working&nbsp;fridge before signing a lease</h2>



<p>If you’re viewing an apartment that’s currently occupied, this might make you look a bit sketchy. However, real estate author and attorney Ron Leshnower says it’s important to know whether or not the apartment’s refrigerator is in good working order. The first thing to check before signing a lease? Something incredibly basic that, if overlooked, could mean a fridge full of spoiled food.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Open and close the refrigerator door to make sure the handle works,” he recommends.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Also, take note of the temperature inside the refrigerator and freezer. If it doesn’t feel cold enough, it could be a sign that it’s not working properly. If the tenants are around, ask if they’ve ever had any issues with the fridge keeping food cold during hot summer months. Note any previous issues, and ask your landlord if you have a concern before signing a lease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Check for functioning windows</h2>



<p>This one is important year-round. You want to make sure you can open and close your windows without letting in any drafts. Drafty windows can mean freezing air in the winter, but if you can’t even open them, you might be stuck in sweltering <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/3-best-ways-beat-heat-nyc" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">heat during the summer.</a>&nbsp;Checking to see if your windows work before signing a lease is a simple task that could save you a lot of headache.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Open the windows to make sure they’re not stuck,” Leshnower says. “And make sure they can be locked for your security.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Take note of any drafts or cracks you see. It could be something you barely notice, but if left unseen, you might waste hundreds of dollars in energy&nbsp;trying to warm up or cool down your apartment later.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Is there weird partial carpeting?</h2>



<p>Regardless of your personal feelings on carpeting, partial carpeting can be a sign of a bad coverup. Principal broker and CEO of Love Where You Live Realty, <a href="http://ilovetheupperwestside.com/about-love-where-you-live-realty/mike-mishkin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Mishkin</a>, says some&nbsp;landlords try to hide damaged floors by&nbsp;throwing a carpet down on top — which is pretty much the equivalent to putting a giant bandaid on the problem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“If there is partial carpeting, make sure you ask your broker why that is,” says Mishkin. “It might be there to cover eroded wood or buckling floors, which could end up causing you problems down the road.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>If you notice any weird partial carpeting, ask the landlord if there is a history of floor damage. If he/she doesn’t answer your question clearly, it could be a sign of something fishy. Make sure to clear this up before signing a lease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Check for clean running water before signing a lease</h2>



<p>One good thing about most plumbing issues is that they’re usually pretty apparent. Head to the bathroom and kitchen and run couple of quick checks you’ll have clean, properly running water upon moving in. Make sure you have hot water (<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/renters-rights-landlord-provide-hot-water/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s your right as a tenant</a>), and look for anything else that signal potential water problems before signing a lease.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Run the shower and sink,”Leshnower says. “And flush the toilet, so there are no unpleasant surprises after you move in.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>See if the pipes underneath the sinks leak when you run the water, and pay attention to the water pressure in the shower.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Checking under the sinks can sometimes reveal other water damage, which could be blamed on you as the tenant if not noted upon the initial inspection,”explains real estate representative Ivan Ciraj</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Also take note of anywhere that water doesn’t drain easily. This could a sign of blocked pipes. Also note any areas where you see mold before you go on to have a signed lease agreement ready. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Is there a functioning door buzzer?</h2>



<p>If the apartment’s amenities include a buzzer system, make sure it’s actually in good working order. Mishkin says to ask if you can test it out while you’re doing your walkthrough. Have your roommate stand outside and buzz in while you listen to hear if it works from the apartment. Then make sure you can buzz him or her in without a problem before signing a lease. </p>



<p>So, you’ve compiled a list of issues. Now, how do you bring them up to your potential new landlord? Rather than rely on a landlord’s word, Leshnower recommends having the landlord agree to address these problems in writing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Have him consent to fix the issues within a certain time frame by adding that language to your lease,” he recommends. “This way, your problems are more likely to be addressed, and you’ll feel more comfortable signing your lease. It will also prevent a situation where the landlord later claims that you, in fact, caused the problems that need repair.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Don’t let potential apartment problems weigh you down on move-in day when you already have a signed lease agreement. Nip them in the bud before signing a lease so they don’t cause unwanted issues for you and your roommate.</p>
