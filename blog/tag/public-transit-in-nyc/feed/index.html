										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ride-sharing apps have become the norm for people who don&#8217;t want to drive a car or use a cab. Sometimes it&#8217;s safer and more convenient to leave the driving and traffic headaches to someone else. Ride-hailing apps have revolutionized how we get about and may help you save a lot of money on travel expenditures. Especially during the pandemic in New York City, there&#8217;s been a shift from <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains/">subways</a> to Uber or Lyft, the two most popular ride-sharing apps. But is one better than the other?</p>



<p>So without any further ado, here’s our comprehensive guide: Uber or Lyft for traveling around NYC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-is-better-uber-or-lyft-in-nyc">Which is better, Uber or Lyft in NYC?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lyft-offers-better-customer-service">Lyft offers better customer service</h3>



<p>You want quick customer assistance when anything goes wrong, especially if your money is on the line. Email, website, in-app help, and an emergency line are all available by both apps.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, both companies have fallen behind on customer service as they have expanded, but Lyft has received higher overall <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k11345115-Lyft_vs_uber-New_York_City_New_York.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">customer service</a> scores. Uber&#8217;s support section includes a lot of predefined solutions, whereas Lyft takes more time with specific concerns and delivers more clear answers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-cost-more-or-less-the-same">They cost more or less the same!</h3>



<p>Basic rideshare costs for both are approximately $1 to start, $2 per mile, and $0.25 per minute. Actual pricing depends on the base fare, distance traveled, drive duration, and a flat booking charge. Prices for both services might fluctuate <em>depending on demand and traffic</em>, making it difficult to determine which is less expensive at any one time. For example, if there are fewer drivers on the road during rush hour, any app may be more expensive, costing up to 1.5 times the regular fee.</p>

<p>Uber and Lyft both have several pooling options to help you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-save-money-while-living-in-midtown-east-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">save money</a>. You share your trip with other nearby passengers for a cheaper fee in carpooling ride-shares. Although carpooling takes longer than regular rides, but it&#8217;s significantly less expensive.</p>



<p>Uber&#8217;s ride-sharing service is UberPool, whereas Lyft provides Shared and Shared Saver rides. Before booking your journey, you may check out your carpooling possibilities on both. UberPool rides need a short walk to a convenient meeting place for the driver. Also, Lyft&#8217;s Shared Saver rides require a short walk, whereas Shared rides do not.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi Tip: A shared ride on Uber or Lyft doesn’t guarantee your driver will pick someone else up, but the discounts apply regardless.</strong></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-safety-measures-a-close-run">Safety Measures: A close run</h3>



<p>Uber and Lyft take driver and passenger safety seriously, taking proactive measures to keep riders as safe as possible. Both businesses use comparable safety precautions, including background checks, giving riders&nbsp;driver information, and panic buttons in the app. Riders may check the name of their driver, car model and color, and license number.</p>

<p>Uber&#8217;s app also includes a <a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/sharing-eta-and-trip-status?nodeId=e1f8ed2b-c0e5-4456-9c73-552cf11c5581" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">RideCheck</a> function that helps users stay safe. This function is said to employ GPS data and sensors to identify unusual behavior in Uber&#8217;s app. Lyft has recently added new <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/lyft-announces-smart-trip-check-in-after-sexual-assault-allegations/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">safety features</a> to the app, including the ability to call 911 within the app. Moreover, it sends your location to emergency services and for the app to detect when a ride has &#8220;unexpected delays&#8221;.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-subscription-plans-which-is-better-uber-or-lyft">Subscription Plans: Which is better, Uber or Lyft?</h3>



<p>Both Uber and Lyft offer subscription options for frequent users, but it&#8217;s important to know which one can save you more money. Regardless of traffic, weather, or time of day, Uber&#8217;s Journey Pass subscription service for UberX and Uber Pool claims to &#8220;consistently&#8221; save you money on each ride. Uber claims that you can save up to 15%, but that amount is subject to change. Also, it&#8217;s unclear if you&#8217;ll save more than 10% or closer to 15%.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s a little too generic, especially considering Ride Pass costs $25 each month.</p>

<p>Lyft offers more subscription plans than Uber, giving users additional alternatives if they don&#8217;t use the service daily. Lyft also offers a <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001541868-Lyft-Pass" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Commute Plan and a Personal Plan</a>, which differ from the Smart Savings and All Access plans.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-ride-hailing-app-wins-uber-or-lyft">Which ride-hailing app wins: Uber or Lyft?</h2>



<p>Uber caters to business travelers, offering a quiet and professional ride from point A to point B. In contrast, Lyft&#8217;s catchphrase &#8220;Your Friend with a Car&#8221; is quite evident as customers can have a joyful and friendly conversation with the drivers.</p>



<p>Team Roomi favors Lyft for its many small benefits, including a slightly better high-demand pricing reputation and a more convenient support channel. Moreover, it also creates a more personalized user experience. If you&#8217;re a US-based frequent rider, Lyft&#8217;s new <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/introducing-lyft-pink" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pink subscription service</a> may be the best option to help you save some money.</p>

<p>However, if you want more features- estimated arrival time before booking a ride, Uber caters to that better. With Lyft, you have to request a ride first to get an ETA. Further, with Uber, there are way more types of rides available. Due to the availability of more luxury car services, riders have more opportunities to get matched to commercially licensed professional drivers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Aah yes, we’ve come around to asking this age old question again: should you get an Uber or a taxi to get around NYC? Uber has taken over all major cities around the world, including NYC. So, it’s no surprise that that might be the go-to for most youngsters in the city. But there&#8217;s just something so iconic about the NYC yellow taxi cab. I mean, you can’t really picture the city without thinking of those yellow cabs driving all over NYC. It’s practically the soul of the city. But as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-subway-crime.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Uber</a> has taken over the city in the past few years, we’ve all found ourselves asking- which option is better? And more importantly, which one is cheaper?</p>



<p>Whether you’ve just <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-perks-of-co-living-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> to NYC and genuinely want to know or just bored at home with nothing else to do, we’ve got all the info you need! So without any further ado, here’s our comprehensive guide traveling around NYC: Cab addition!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nyc-taxi-or-uber-which-is-better">NYC Taxi or Uber: Which is better?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-an-uber-better-than-a-taxi-in-nyc">Is an Uber better than a Taxi in NYC?</h3>



<p>We don’t need to explain to you what uber is, you’ve probably already used it a hundred times. But even if you haven’t they’re actually not that different from a regular taxi. In fact, they’re pretty similar to a yellow taxi cab in how they calculate fares. It’s a combination of the time and distance with an additional fare of any tolls added at the&nbsp; end.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-ll-need-a-phone">You’ll need a phone!</h3>



<p>But of course, the big difference is, you need a working smartphone and an internet connection to book yourself an Uber. So, if you ever find yourself with a dead phone in NYC, uber is not an option for you. Unless, of course, you want to endure the humiliation of going up to a total stranger and asking to use their phone (which, just FYI, is a terrible choice in NYC).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rating-system-ftw">Rating system FTW!</h3>



<p>But there’s a lot of ways in which Uber proves itself to be very useful. First of all, you get to check the rating of the Driver (and they get to see yours as well). If they’ve got a good rating, you can get in the Uber without much stress. You can even share your ride with a friend to be even more cautious.</p>



<p>Uber is also extremely proactive about getting <a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/how-to-contact-support?_csid=tftARz7iRs3LbSqoWjt0Cg&amp;nodeId=4c69afef-5739-4842-9e98-ed0087b873db&amp;state=kjQb7yU1l8Giz_5UZEvEVLc2sdpdNSn6EO12tCipZ4M%3D" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">feedback</a> from the customer. So, if you have a bad experience, you can report it instantly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-availability">Availability!</h3>



<p>Uber is especially useful if you find yourselves in the Suburbs of NYC. Because, while taxi cabs are abundant in the city, you’ll have a real hard time flagging one down once you’re out in the suburbs.</p>



<p>So, now that you’ve got a pretty well-rounded understanding of getting an Uber in NYC, let’s move onto yellow taxis!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-a-taxi-better-than-uber-in-nyc">Is a Taxi better than Uber in NYC?</h3>



<p>Oh what can we say about the New York yellow taxi cab that hasn’t been said before? I mean, it’s an indispensable part of the NYC experience. Just watch any of the thousand movies set in NYC, and we’re sure you’ll find at least a dozen taxis in all the outdoor shots. Yeah, it’s an integral part of the city. But of course, times have changed and perhaps, the taxi might be one of those things that will slowly fade away. After all, aren’t all these new transportation apps supposed to be cheaper anyway?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-actually-cheaper">It’s actually cheaper!</h3>



<p>You’d think that but, surprisingly no, a taxi cab is still cheaper than an Uber in NYC. To be precise, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03021" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> from the University of Cambridge has found that a taxi cab is generally cheaper for shorter trips. Once a trip costs more than $35, then an Uber is likely going to be cheaper for you. But even then, it’s a toss up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-readily-available">Readily Available</h3>



<p>Yellow taxi cabs are everywhere in NYC. Honestly, just wave once as you’re standing at the curb and you’ll find like 10 taxis. Of course, be prepared to be yelled at if flag down a taxi around for no reason in NYC. You don’t need a smartphone or an internet connection to get a taxi, one flailing arm will do. So, if you’re in the City and in need of a cab immediately, a yellow taxi wins hands down!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-customer-service-and-feedback">Customer service and feedback</h3>



<p>It’s not unheard of to have a bad experience with your cab driver. But the procedure to report such an incident is not as instant as it is with Uber. For starters, The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission mandates that all taxis have a passenger bill of rights inside the cab that drivers and cab owners must adhere to. If you want to file an official complaint, you need to dial 311 or go online and report the incident through this <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/filing-complaint-with-tlc.page" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">form</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-who-wins-the-uber-vs-taxi-debate-in-nyc">So, who wins the Uber vs. Taxi debate in NYC?</h2>



<p>Well, both an Uber and a Taxi have their pros and cons in NYC. Of course, team Roomi will always suggest the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains/">subway</a> if you’re in NYC. But we understand that many people aren’t yet comfortable taking the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-subway-crime.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">subway</a> because of the pandemic. But if a cab is your only option, we recommend going with an NYC yellow taxi. It’s cheaper, easily available and honestly, it’s an integral part of living in NYC that you must enjoy at least once!</p>
