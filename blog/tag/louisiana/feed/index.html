<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Baton Rouge</h2>



<p>The name Baton Rouge comes from &#8216;Bâton-Rouge&#8217; which is French for &#8216;red stick.&#8217; The name came about when French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d&#8217;Iberville arrived and spotted a red pole. This pole was actually a divider between tribal hunting grounds in the area. Baton Rouge has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters and hot and humid summers. However, its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico exposes the area to hurricanes around July. If you are looking to move and find rooms for rent in Baton Rouge, read on &#8211; and try to avoid any crazy weather!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Airports</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.flybtr.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport</a> is the major airport that serves the city and is located in North Baton Rouge. Airlines like American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Airlines offer non-stop service to the city. However, the <a href="https://www.neworleans.com/listing/louis-armstrong-new-orleans-international-airport-(msy)/1160/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport</a> is also popular among travelers. It&#8217;s only an hour away and has more budget airlines flying in. Both airports have express buses and taxis connecting them to the city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Buses</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.greyhound.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greyhound</a>, <a href="https://www.megabus.com/">Megabus</a>, and <a href="https://www.flixbus.com/bus/united-states">Flixbus</a> are the leading options if you want to reach Baton Rouge by bus. If you are finding rooms for rent in Baton Rouge, be sure to check for local bus stops. The <a href="https://www.brcats.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capital Area Transit System (CATS)</a> provides urban transportation in most of the city. These buses also connect Baton Rouge with nearby cities in the metropolitan area. Their updated <a href="https://www.brcats.com/index.cfm/page/134" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">fares and routes</a> can be found online.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis</h3>



<p>Taxis in Baton Rouge are generally safe, but more expensive compared to other cities, and you might run into difficulties finding one in certain places. Hence, it makes sense to book one in advance. Ride-sharing apps like <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://m.uber.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Uber</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lyft</a> are also available, which can be handy if you are looking for rooms for rent in Baton Rouge in an out-of-the-way area.</p>



<p><strong>Taxi rates in Baton Rouge</strong>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th>Taxi rates for</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Taxi Start (Normal Tariff)</td><td>$4</td></tr><tr><td>Taxi 1-hour waiting  (Normal Tariff) </td><td>$30</td></tr><tr><td>Taxi 1 km  (Normal Tariff) </td><td>$1.30</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Walking</h3>



<p>Walking is a popular way to get around Baton Rouge as the city has great walkability and is fairly compact. With a higher than an average number of households not owning a car, walking is an easy way to commute. Most of the areas near the city center and University are quite walkable, so you may not feel the need to own a car or use public transportation. It can be practical to find rooms for rent in Baton Rouge near your University or workplace.</p>
