										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020, for most of us, promised a bounty of opportunities, great clients, better paychecks, and a bright future. Well, many thanks to the pandemic, all our careers have taken a back seat without our consent. Due to this, we all have spent time grappling with the realities of life these past few months. So now, it&#8217;s time we use all the spare time to find motivation and fine-tune our personal development. Let&#8217;s find alternate ways to make our careers work for us!</p>



<p>Our&nbsp;recommendation&nbsp;would be to get stuck into some of these self-help books that will serve as&nbsp;career advice&nbsp;and motivation for all those seeking clarity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>1. David &amp; Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants</em>&nbsp;by Malcolm Gladwell</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;You can&#8217;t concentrate on doing anything if you are thinking, &#8220;What&#8217;s gonna happen if it doesn&#8217;t go right?&#8221; </em></p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/1439.Malcolm_Gladwell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malcolm Gladwell</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Gladwell&#8217;s narration in this book draws examples from infamous stories, how the world perceives them, and the reality. As humans, we instinctively avoid conflict and paths that look dangerous or unsafe. The book walks the readers through an array of stories and compelling historical examples of how someone who may look small can surprisingly be tough and beat the big.</p>



<p><em>Goodreads Rating: 4.34/5</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <em>So Good They Can&#8217;t Ignore You</em> by Cal Newport</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;the happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do. On reflection, this makes sense.&#8221; </em></p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/147891.Cal_Newport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cal Newport</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Most people feel that success comes from following your heart and passions. But Cal Newport begs to differ from this point of view. Newport says that developing skills rather than focussing on desires you already have is the key to successful job experiences. In addition, the book curates&nbsp;career advice&nbsp;by interviewing some of the most successful people; it has advice from everyone from farmers, venture capitalists, and freelancers. These interviews help the reader discover strategies and&nbsp;<strong>career management</strong>&nbsp;skills and personal development tips to enhance their job experiences.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <em>The Third Door</em> by Alex Banayan</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;You have a choice,&#8221; Dan said. &#8220;You can be good at those twenty-five things or you can be world-class at the five. Most people have so many things they want to do that they never do a single thing well. If I&#8217;ve learned one thing from Mr. Buffett, it&#8217;s that the Avoidance List is the secret to being world-class.&#8221; &#8220;Success,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is a result of prioritizing your desires.&#8221;</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/17391335.Alex_Banayan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Banayan</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This book is a result of an eighteen-year-old tracking some of the most influential celebrities and businessmen and uncovering their secrets to success. Consequently, in all of his adventures, he learned what all these influential people had in common â€“ the &#8216;third door.&#8217; </p>



<p>These successful individuals didn&#8217;t wait in line or follow the norms that most people support. Instead, they barged their way into success with hard work and determination. Not only does the book teaches tons of valuable lessons on building a robust network, but you also learn how to approach your potential clients online and ways to handle rejections.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <em>The Confidence Code</em> by Katty Kay &amp; Claire Shipman</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Confidence is the purity of action produced by a mind free of doubt.&#8221;  </em></p><cite><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=katty+kay&amp;search%5Bsource%5D=goodreads&amp;search_type=quotes&amp;tab=quotes" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katty Kay</a></em></cite></blockquote>



<p>This self-help book talks about how today&#8217;s women have advanced and leveraged education and talent in their professional lives. It also offers solid&nbsp;<strong>career advice</strong>&nbsp;to budding woman entrepreneurs and freelancers on how confidence is the name of the game. It also talks about how women can harness this strength in their everyday professional lives.</p>



<p>In this New York Times bestseller, &#8220;The Confidence Code,&#8221; Katty explains how women find it hard to be confident because of the way their brain operates and how they are so connected to their surroundings. This practical guide reveals how women can get whatever careers they choose by quoting examples and research material from various fields.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Powerful people initiate speech more often, talk more overall, and make more eye contact while they&#8217;re speaking than powerless people do. When we feel powerful, we speak more slowly and take more time. We don&#8217;t rush. We&#8217;re not afraid to pause. We feel entitled to the time we&#8217;re using.&#8221;</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/6862909.Amy_Cuddy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Cuddy</a><em>&nbsp;</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Have you noticed how successful individuals deliver speeches/talk, which is both captivating and compelling? Harvard professor and the author of &#8220;Presence,&#8221; Amy Cuddy, teaches her readers to use the right tools and behavior mechanisms to change the way they view obstacles and the art of first impressions. Moreover, in this personal development and self-help book, she uses research to teach valuable lessons on building a presence by being authentic and genuine to oneself.</p>
