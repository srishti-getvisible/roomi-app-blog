										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We&#8217;ve lost count of how many days it&#8217;s been since the dreaded &#8216;rona came around.</p>



<p>But let&#8217;s say it like this &#8211; it&#8217;s year 2 of corona and we&#8217;re still partially stuck indoors in our apartments. When we do go out, however, our mouths are shut in masks and we feel suffocated, still.</p>



<p>And if we happen to meet our friends and family, coming back to our apartment feels somehow worse, even if we co live with roomis.</p>



<p>Hello, coronavirus cabin fever!</p>



<p>The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines cabin fever as <strong><em>extreme irritability and restlessness from living in isolation or a confined indoor area for a prolonged time.</em></strong></p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all been feeling the symptoms of coronavirus cabin fever ever since the start of 2020. I think that&#8217;s a fair assumption.</p>



<p>To say the least, we&#8217;re sick of being in our apartments, and chances are, our apartments and roomis might have grown sick of us too.</p>



<p>Now while not everyone may feel the same symptoms or the same intensity of coronavirus cabin fever, it&#8217;s safe to assume that we&#8217;re all feeling it.</p>



<p>So here are some ways we&#8217;re dealing with the coronavirus cabin fever. Hoping you find solace in them too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Learning to deal with isolation from the cosmonauts</h2>



<p>So astronauts deal with <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/creative-things-self-isolation/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-isolation</a> for life, don&#8217;t they? When they&#8217;re not isolated, they&#8217;re certainly practicing or training for it.</p>



<p>Even if they co-live with other astronauts, and are not completely isolated, being in a space machine must be far tougher than what we&#8217;re having to deal with. Think how they can&#8217;t even go out for a bike ride or a long walk in the park with the masks on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541739358-9f3a2a3b6559?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=967&amp;q=80" alt="isolation, Coronavirus Cabin Fever"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So how do they do it?</h3>



<p>As we learned from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200408-an-astronauts-guide-to-surviving-isolation" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">astronauts who spoke about isolation with the BBC</a>, the first thing we need to do is accept our situation and get comfortable with it. The fact of the matter is there&#8217;s no running away from our apartments and we&#8217;re all stuck in this together.</p>



<p>So to learn how to deal with the coronavirus cabin fever, we need to stop wine-ing and whining, and completely accept our circumstances.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Make a schedule that keeps you busy and entertained</h2>



<p>When we talk of being entertained, the first thought that might pop up in our brains is <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/7-binge-worthy-netflix-shows-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> or other entertainment sites on the internet. Which is fine, but after a point of time, it might seem like these things are draining us out.</p>



<p>And they surely do! We lose track of time, we stop caring about our health and fitness, and the people we co-live with.And soon we become passive zombies looking for the next new distraction from the coronavirus cabin fever.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582812532891-7968f272fc9a?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=967&amp;q=80" alt="coronavirus cabin fever"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How will a schedule help?</h3>



<p>But we should realize that if we are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-work-from-home-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">working from home with roomis</a> in our apartments, we&#8217;re the lucky ones. And when you have luck on your side, it&#8217;s best to play our best game and get the best things out of our time.</p>



<p>And this would be possible only with a good schedule that includes taking care of our health and fitness.This includes <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/reddit-tips-for-when-you-cant-sleep-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a time to sleep</a> and wake up, a time to work, and a time to play.</p>



<p>This will help the time pass easily without making us feel the dread of coronavirus cabin fever! So jot down all the things you wish to do in a day and make a schedule that supports those wishes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Move your body</h2>



<p>The most important thing to put in your schedule is a time and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/home-environment-and-healthy-living-habits-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">place in your home for health and fitness</a>. Whether your health and fitness regime is supported by a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/creating-a-budget-friendly-gym-at-home-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">home gym</a>, or a dance routine, or Yoga, there are limitless benefits of moving your body every day.</p>



<p>The serotonin (the happy hormone) flowing through your veins would keep you happy, energized, and productive. Bonus: you&#8217;ll find yourself dealing with the coronavirus cabin fever better when you work out for health and fitness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487956382158-bb926046304a?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1051&amp;q=80" alt="work out for health and fitness"/></figure>



<p>And since quarantine hit, we know we&#8217;ve been munching too much and thinking about health and fitness too less. So why not work out so you can fit into your old pair of jeans again?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Spend time with roomis</h2>



<p>In times like these, the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/taking-coronavirus-precautions-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roomis you co-live with</a> at your apartment are all you&#8217;ve got, whether you like it or not! So do the needful and carve out plans for some quality time with the roomis who co-live with you.</p>



<p>Bond with them overcooking, or drinking, or just lazing around and watching movies. Social interaction is of utmost importance, and we&#8217;re all feeling the lack of it. Yes, even the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">socially anxious among us</a>!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601758003122-53c40e686a19?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1050&amp;q=80" alt="two roommate spending time with their dogs " width="610" height="406"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What if there&#8217;s conflict?</h3>



<p>And yes, since we&#8217;re all stuck indoors with the roomis we co-live with, there&#8217;s bound to be conflicts too! So anticipate the conflicts that you might have to face and how you would resolve them. Also try and be on your best behavior. It&#8217;s a stressful time, even for the annoying roomi in your shared apartment.</p>



<p>So <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/bond-with-your-roommate-with-these-fun-traditions-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make the roomis you co-live with feel loved</a> as often as you can and they would surely return the favor to help deal with coronavirus cabin fever.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Pick up something new to learn</h2>



<p>Now with our time alone at home, there are bound to be times when we&#8217;re tired of spending time and doing things with the roomis. So while you hibernate in your room, stop thinking about how bored you are.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1475275166152-f1e8005f9854?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1052&amp;q=80" alt="a woman playing piano "/></figure>



<p>Instead, pick up a hobby or a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/inspiring-quotes-to-help-you-learn-new-skills-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skill you&#8217;ve always wanted to learn</a> to deal with coronavirus cabin fever. Take leverage of the internet and use it for something other than browsing memes! Trust that your future self will thank you for making good use of this time.</p>

<p>If a book named &#8216;How To Manage Your Raging Coronavirus Anxiety&#8217; existed, building a routine would be the first chapter. Here&#8217;s what the experts say about the importance of a routine:</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing a good workout can&#8217;t beat esp. when you can&#8217;t help but stress about the coronavirus pandemic.

<p>How to manage anxiety? Find a fluffy friend &#8211; because the best therapist has four legs, a heart of gold, and fur! It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a dog person or a cat person, petting all animals can help release oxytocin, a brain chemical that promotes a positive mood.</p>



<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;Gazing deep into your dog&#8217;s eyes releases &#8216;Oxytocin&#8217; in both you and your pet. Which can not only make you happier but also help you combat stress and anxiety effectively. Isn&#8217;t that the cutest?</p>

<p>When the world feels like a desolate place, and everything seems meaningless, believe in someone greater than yourself. It&#8217;s the coronavirus pandemic and some of the best minds on the whole of the earth are struggling to find a way out of it, so if you&#8217;re religious, this is a great time to turn to your faith. If not, take some time out of every day to meditate &#8211; it can feel strange at first, but stick at it to experience the calming benefits.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>And Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</em></p><cite>&#8211; Mark 11:22-24</cite></blockquote>

<p>This may seem obvious, but people just aren&#8217;t reconnecting enough right now. People suffering from long-term stress and anxiety seem to shut themselves out fearing that their friends and family won&#8217;t understand them. It&#8217;s extremely challenging for them to manage their anxiety &#8211; even the most menial tasks become cumbersome.</p>



<p>So having a close-knit circle of friends to talk with, is the most comforting experience at this time. If you, or someone you know is battling anxiety, be sure to seek or extend comfort. Let&#8217;s all be there for each other and help manage the raging stress &amp; anxiety that most of us are overlooking.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;One study found that for women in particular, spending time with friends and children helps release oxytocin, a natural stress reliever. This effect is called “tend and befriend,” and is the opposite of the fight-or-flight response.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10941275/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pubmed.gov</a></em></cite></blockquote>

<p>Es un hecho: toooodos queremos saber sobre la vacuna de Pfizer con la ilusión de regresar un poco a la normalidad que teníamos antes.</p>



<p>Hay muchísima información que anda rondando la web y, como siempre, no toda (probablemente la mayoría) no es verídica o confiable. Por eso, nos hemos dado a la tarea de consultar medios tan reconocidos como <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a> y <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk?INTCMP=CE_UK">The Guardian</a> para darte los puntos más importantes que debes conocer sobre la vacuna de Pfizer que ya están aplicando en Inglaterra.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>¿Es segura la vacuna de Pfizer y qué tan efectiva es?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Las fases de prueba de la vacuna contra el coronavirus se realizaron en más de 42,000 personas en 6 países y no se han levantado alertas de precaución de bioseguridad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Todas las vacunas se someten a pruebas rigurosas y están supervisadas por reguladores experimentados. La seguridad pública es lo primero y los reguladores verifican que las pruebas muestren que una vacuna cumple con altos estándares de seguridad y eficacia antes de dar una licencia.</p>



<p>Su eficacia es de 95% y se requieren 2 aplicaciones de la vacuna (entre 3 y 4 semanas entre cada dosis).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>¿Cómo funciona la vacuna contra el coronavirus de Pfizer?</strong></h2>



<p>La vacuna Pfizer, elaborada en conjunto con BioNTech, se conoce como vacuna de ARN mensajero (ARNm), que utiliza el código genético del virus en lugar de cualquier parte del virus en sí, y se inyecta en el cuerpo donde ingresa a las células y les dice que hagan antígenos. Las vacunas convencionales se producen utilizando formas debilitadas del virus.</p>



<p>Algunos creen que las vacunas de ARNm son más seguras para el paciente, ya que no dependen de que ningún elemento del virus se inyecte en el cuerpo.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>¿Cuánto tiempo tarda en desarrollarse completamente la inmunidad después de la aplicación de la vacuna?</strong></h2>



<p>La fase de pruebas comenzó a evaluar la inmunidad 7 días después de la segunda inyección. Se sabe que la inmunidad protectora se construye dentro de las 4 semanas posteriores a la primera dosis, pero puede desarrollarse antes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Es una vacuna que requiere de dos inyecciones ¿Qué sucede si alguien no se aplica la segunda vacuna?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Se necesitan 2 inyecciones y la segunda es indispensable para lograr la inmunidad.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>¿Tiene efectos secundarios la vacuna de Pfizer?</strong></h2>



<p>A veces, pero son leves. En las pruebas, la vacuna fue generalmente bien tolerada y el comité de seguimiento de datos no informó sobre problemas graves de seguridad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Los peores efectos secundarios fueron fatiga y dolores de cabeza después de la segunda dosis. Aproximadamente el 4% de las personas informó que sintió fatiga y el 2% dolor de cabeza. Otros efectos secundarios fueron dolor en el lugar donde se aplicó la inyección y dolor muscular. Estas son reacciones comunes que se tienen con las vacunas.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>¿La vacuna funciona en personas mayores?</strong></h2>



<p>Si. Los participantes en las pruebas tuvieron hasta 85 años de edad y la eficacia en personas mayores de 65 fue de 94%, un poco más baja que el número total, pero aún muy protectora y mucho más alta de lo que temían algunos expertos en vacunas. </p>



<p>La vacuna no se ha probado en personas mayores de 85 años.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>¿Qué pasa con otros grupos vulnerables?</strong></h2>



<p>De acuerdo a BioNTech, la vacuna parece ser igualmente eficaz independientemente de la edad, sexo y origen étnico de las personas. Se ha probado ampliamente en personas que ya han tenido el virus y no causa efectos nocivos. También se ha probado en personas con afecciones preexistentes &#8220;estables&#8221;, también conocidas como comorbilidades, que incluyen diabetes, cáncer, hepatitis B, hepatitis C y VIH bien controlado. Su respuesta fue tan positiva como la de cualquier otra persona.</p>



<p>Ahora que tienes toda esta información puedes hacer tu propio criterio de lo que piensas sobre la vacuna de Pfizer contra el coronavirus. Recuerda que se vale opinar, pero siempre hay que hacerlo de manera informada.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the pandemic life becoming regulated <em>(thanks to the &#8216;new normal&#8217; terms)</em>, more and more offices are demanding their employees to get back to work in their physical offices. While most employees are okay with not working remotely, others are anxious about traveling to work. Mostly because that means coming into contact with people. If your boss is calling you to the office, just use these tips to convince them to let you work from home.</p>

Here&#8217;s How You Can Separate &#8216;Home&#8217; and &#8216;Work&#8217;.</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is working remotely even possible for you?</h2>



<p>Okay, this one goes without saying; surgeons, pilots, Uber drivers, and so many other professionals can&#8217;t work from home.</p>

<p>However, there are plenty of teleworking roles that can be managed remotely. This includes roles such as copywriters, social media managers, designers, and sales jobs. Analyze your role to the finest detail. Moreover, read your job description and note tasks that can be managed from home. This activity will come in handy when you want to propose WFH to your bosses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure you&#8217;re good at what you do!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Your bosses won&#8217;t let you take this remote working opportunity if they don&#8217;t even trust you with your work. So it&#8217;s essential to know your place! If you&#8217;re not a top performer well versed with culture and operations, your boss can easily hire someone new to replace you. We recommend that you ask yourself the following questions before you present this idea to your employers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>What&#8217;s your track record when it comes to performance reviews?</li><li>Did you make any recent mistakes? If so, how did you recover?</li><li>How&#8217;s your rapport with your coworkers &amp; clients?</li><li>Have you received a mention/positive feedback from clients or team leads?</li><li>What&#8217;s your USP?</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Explore what&#8217;s working remotely means for the company and your boss</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Your bosses will have to weigh many essential questions before they give you the go-ahead for this.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Will this impact your productivity &amp; output?</li><li>Does this make life harder or easier for your coworkers?</li><li>Will other coworkers demand the same treatment?</li></ul>



<p>Fortunately, there are many tangible benefits for companies implementing remote working jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Increased employee productivity</li><li>Increased employee morale &amp; health</li><li>Decreased spread of the coronavirus contagions</li><li>Lower employee turnover</li><li>Increased sense of ownership to drive tasks to completion</li><li>Lesser stress levels = Less downtime/sick days</li><li>Less expenses on electronics, office bills etc.</li></ul>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telework.gov/reports-studies/reports-to-congress/2016-report-to-congress.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Government study under the Obama administration Office of Personnel Management</a>&nbsp;also indicated common organizational benefits of teleworking, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Better emergency preparedness (59%)</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Improved employee attitudes (58%)</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Better recruitment (35%)</li></ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Reduced real estate costs (17%)</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Reduced energy use (13%)</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;56% of jobs in the U.S. are now compatible with at least occasional remote work. And the number of people working from home “occasionally” increased from 37% in 2015 to 43% in 2016.

<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to talk about your apprehensions about joining work in the middle of a pandemic. The coronavirus outbreak is an unforeseen crisis that has impacted many lives and continues to do so. Make a list of things that make you want to work from home right now. </p>



<p>For instance:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Taking public transport</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Interacting with groups in the office</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Anxiety about passing it on to elderly parents or grandparents who are most at risk of the virus</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Strike a deal! Present your idea &amp; negotiate.</h2>



<p>Talk to your superiors about your idea and try to understand their concerns. Carry a positive and problem-solving mindset to this meeting, and don&#8217;t hesitate to speak about your genuine worries. Empathy is a big part of business organizations, and chances are that your employers will be supportive and understanding of your decisions. If your employer feels it&#8217;s too early to take this step, here are some other tips that&#8217;ll come in handy:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Move-in with a roomi: Consider moving in with <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-to-do-if-your-roommate-has-covid-symptoms-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommates</a> if you&#8217;re living with older parents or grandparents</li><li>Suggest a trial run if your bosses aren&#8217;t totally convinced with the idea</li><li>Negotiate and offer to come in once a week instead of every day</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The coronavirus outbreak has forced most of us into uncomfortable situations resulting in a severe personal and professional life imbalance. With responsibilities piling up on the work front, the boundaries between WFH and personal leisure time are also blurring. Many coworkers view talking about their problems as a sign of weakness or vulnerability. However, if you&#8217;re noticing signs of burnout or emotional fatigue &#8211; reach out to your coworkers with empathy, even when you can&#8217;t physically be with them. Kindness at work is what the world needs today!</p>

<p>At Roomi, we aim to celebrate kindness every day! However, this World Kindness Day, we wanted to share some ways to help your coworkers through the coronavirus crisis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Reach out &amp; spread kindness at work</h2>

<p>With nearly all of us tied up with work from home, it&#8217;s easy to forget the warm faces and big smiles that once greeted us each morning. If you haven&#8217;t already, take some time to reach out to different teams to check on them. Keep this call separate from work and give time for your peers to express their concerns.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Understand their daily struggles &amp; routine</h2>



<p>Everyone is facing the same crisis, but not everyone is facing it under the same circumstances. With most countries under a second lockdown and roommates traveling back home, most people are having to work in isolation. Others manage a massive load of chores with work from home. And most are cut off from their family &amp; friends. If you have a floating team worldwide, many other cultural &amp; state restrictions also come into play. So take time to understand the following about your coworkers, and see which ways you can offer help and spread kindness at work:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Are they away from friends &amp; family? Do they have any social support?</li><li>How are they feeling amid the coronavirus pandemic (both physically and mentally)?</li><li>Who are they sharing their space with &#8211; family/kids/roommates/SO/pets?</li><li>Do they have the ability to work during the day? Or are they trying to manage work at night when it&#8217;s quiet?</li><li>Do they have access to good internet or struggle to find a reliable connection all day while working from home? </li><li>Do they have access to groceries and essentials?</li></ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>&nbsp;It&#8217;s difficult to know how someone is doing until we take the time to ask. More and more workplaces are demanding productivity, not knowing what the employees are undergoing personally. This small effort as a Team Lead, Manager, or just a colleague could really brighten someone&#8217;s day. Let&#8217;s put mental peace before tasks and spread kindness at work.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Stay in touch even when working from home</h2>



<p>We need this now more than ever! Invite your colleagues for virtual coffee, a gaming session, or birthday parties, and let them know that you care. Set up time slots to check up on either groups or individuals daily or at least weekly.</p>



<p>Sometimes a simple text like, &#8220;Hey Sarah, how are you doing?&#8221; can help someone feel loved and cared for.</p>

<p>Create a safe, encouraging, and nurturing place for all your coworkers to seek refuge in these challenging times. The coronavirus pandemic has impacted our physical, mental, and social wellbeing. With our minds filled with anxieties and a sense of impending doom, it&#8217;s hard to find calm &amp; peace in our waking lives. However, our actions can help establish a positive work field for many of our coworkers who WFH.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It&#8217;s okay to not be perfect</strong></h3>



<p>Make it okay for coworkers to not have perfect outfits, hair, or backgrounds during Zoom calls. It&#8217;s always great to practice what you preach; in this case, you could start by sharing instances that point out how you&#8217;re struggling and need help. This will encourage more people to speak up and deal with the crisis in a better way. Just be sure it doesn&#8217;t spiral into a negative conversation, and offer supportive ways to help them through.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A culture of gratitude</strong></h3>



<p>Consider initiating a team gratitude practice by starting or finishing each meeting with a question:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>What made you smile today?</li><li>What are you most grateful for today?</li><li>What&#8217;s the Coronavirus pandemic taught you?</li><li>What&#8217;s one thing you took for granted before the Coronavirus pandemic?</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Be patient &amp; forgiving</strong></h3>



<p>Get in the habit of appreciating more and criticizing less. Be patient and understanding with your coworkers, yes, even when they arrive late at a meeting or forget some detail in an email/presentation. For example: &#8220;Jennifer, I noticed that you haven&#8217;t submitted the weekly report yet. I wanted to check if you need my help with it. Also hoping you and your family are doing well.&#8221;</p>



<p>Regardless of a crisis, how we respond when coworkers make a mistake profoundly impacts them and the culture you&#8217;re trying to build. Be kind and empathetic to build a safe place for people to work in.</p>

<p>Did you know that about 70% to 80% of the dust in your house comes from the dead skin cells we shed, tiny fibers from our clothes,  dried feces, and dust mite corpses? This is one of those &#8216;eww, gross&#8217; facts that will make you want to deep clean and sanitize your apartment immediately. Feel the itch to sanitize your room and your soul? We got you!</p>



<p> Yuck! Regular cleaning will help you keep surfaces clean, but deep cleaning is a must &#8211; especially now that coronavirus has turned us into home dwellers and home workers. The shift to working from home has got us spending more and more time in our private spaces which equals more germs and bacteria that can potentially grow around us.</p>

<p>No need to worry! &#8216;Cause Roomi has your back ? Here&#8217;s a checklist you can use to clean and sanitize room-by-room.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Before you start to deep clean and sanitize your apartment, here&#8217;s a fool-proof game plan:</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clear the clutter</li>



<li>Plan your cleaning process over a few days</li>



<li>Stock your cleaning supplies before you begin. <em>The United States Environmental Protection Agency provides this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">List of disinfectants to use against COVID-19</a> &#8211;</em> we recommend checking it out.</li>
</ol>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/netflix-the-home-edit-clea-and-joanna-get-organized-with-VdzZS1qXneqUQj6YgJ"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/VdzZS1qXneqUQj6YgJ/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="Reese Witherspoon Home GIF by NETFLIX - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="480" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Don&#8217;t forget to sanitize your apartment bathrooms!</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Scrub and clean showers, bathtubs, sinks, and toilets – spray your tub with multi-purpose cleaner and let it work its magic for a while before you clean.</li>



<li>Wipe down fixtures, mirrors, and windows</li>



<li>Wash glass shower doors</li>



<li>Put cloth curtains and shower mats in the washing machine</li>



<li>Clean out under the sink and inside drawers</li>



<li>Tackle the grout – with vinegar, baking soda, and water</li>



<li>Disinfect handles and doorknobs</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tips:</em></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Wipe the base of the toilet near the floor, where dust and dribbles accumulate</li>



<li>To remove buildup on the mirror, a slightly damp dryer sheet will work well</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Sanitize your apartment kitchen: keep the pesky bugs away!</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Wipe down cabinets</li>



<li>Vacuum out the refrigerator coils and vents</li>



<li>Defrost the freezer and clean the fridge</li>



<li>Throw away old sponges</li>



<li>Scrub the stovetop and vent</li>



<li>Clean the oven</li>



<li>Organize the pantry</li>



<li>Clean the microwave</li>



<li>Disinfect the sink</li>



<li>Wipe down the countertops</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tips:</em></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Coat gas stovetop surfaces (not the grates) with car wax, then wipe it off. The car wax will make it easier to clean up future spills.</li>



<li>Hang a writing board inside your pantry to keep notes of what you have or what you need.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Common areas</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An important step to sanitize your apartment properly is to ensure common areas are in order</li>



<li>Vacuum the space underneath the cushions from the couches and chairs</li>



<li>Shampoo rugs and carpets to sanitize them</li>



<li>Polish wooden furniture to clean them</li>



<li>Clean and wipe ceiling fans, baseboards, window treatments, and light fixtures</li>



<li>Dust your décor</li>



<li>Clean your electronics to sanitize</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tips:</em></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>To remove stains from microfiber fabrics, use rubbing alcohol by dabbing it on with a white sponge and scrub with a white bristle brush</li>



<li>The “steam” function on your clothing iron works as an excellent steam cleaner</li>



<li>Blast your wooden furniture with a hairdryer at close range, especially places with water stains and then treat the wood with a furniture polish or mineral oil</li>



<li>Use a lint roller on lampshades to remove any dust or pet hair that has accumulated there</li>
</ol>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Bedrooms</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>To sanitize your room properly, start from the center and move outwards</li>



<li>Wash the duvet cover and bedding, including bed skirts and shams</li>



<li>Flip your mattress</li>



<li>Dust ceiling fans, window treatments, and headboards to clean them</li>



<li>Check behind dressers and under beds and vacuum/mop</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tips:</em></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>To remove mattress stains, use a foam shaving cream. Use a slightly damp rag dipped in a half-water/half-vinegar solution to wipe off the shaving cream once it has been there for 15 minutes.</li>



<li>There could be dust clamps falling from the ceiling fans. You can prevent this by sliding each fan blade into a pillowcase to get the dust off before taking a rag to it.</li>



<li>Use a telescoping pole to your vacuum cleaner and a mop head to reach hard places on your furniture.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Closets</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You may want to skip this step to sanitize your apartment, but closet clutter takes the longest!</li>



<li>Rotate seasonal items</li>



<li>Throw away items that you no longer need</li>



<li>Vacuum carpet and ceilings</li>



<li>Wipe down shelves and inside drawers</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tips:</em></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>To organize smaller items like hand towels or underwear, use drawer dividers or fabric bins.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Laundry Room</h2>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Unfortunately, COVID-19 is an unwelcome guest in the world that is either keeping us trapped at home. Or we&#8217;re feeling on edge with our masks on every time we step out, imagining COVID symptoms in everyone we encounter.</p>



<p>And if you live with roommates, an inevitable panic can set in, even in our safe spaces at home. You find yourself worrying about your roommate contracting the coronavirus if they&#8217;re an essential worker, or if they&#8217;re stepping out more often than required. Each time they come back home, you may have had some unwelcome thoughts entering your head.</p>



<p>While you don&#8217;t need to be worried all the time, there are some basic guidelines you should be aware of to cope with shared housing in times of coronavirus. While the CDC says <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">most people have mild COVID-19 illness and can recover at home without medical care</a>, it is better to get tested to be sure and stay safe.</p>



<p>If you can see signs that your roommate has COVID symptoms, it&#8217;s always best that they get tested. In the meantime, this guide will help you navigate shared living.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Practise the COVID-19 social distancing within your home</h2>



<p>In a situation like this, it is best to physically isolate your sick roommate to a separate room, so that they are comfortable moving around in that space without worrying about infecting the other members of the house. And you will be comfortable, too. This includes having a separate bathroom, if that&#8217;s possible.</p>



<p>But if you live in a small apartment where the number of rooms is limited, make sure your roomi has a physically isolated space in the home you share. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-work-from-home-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keep your activities separate</a> and try to keep a distance between you and your sick roommate at all times. If you share a bathroom, advise your roomi to use a toiletry bag instead of keeping their things on the counter. Also, keep all dishes, towels, electronics, and gadgets separate. In this case, NOT sharing is caring.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Stay in touch (emotionally)</h2>



<p>If your roommate has COVID symptoms, they are more scared than you are! While you practice social distancing and avoid any physical contact with your sick roommate, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/mindful-habits-for-your-mental-health-during-covid-19/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">do remember to check in on them emotionally</a>. Take advantage of your thin walls, and talk through them, or sit by their door and make conversation. You could drop in notes for your sick friend to let them know you care about their well-being. Or just call or text them on their phone. Admit it: you guys always used to text from the other room just because getting out of bed was too much of an effort. So put that practice to good use now.</p>



<p>If you need to be around your sick roommate physically, both of you should wear masks and you should thoroughly wash your hands after each visit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Help your sick roommate out with food &amp; laundry</h2>



<p>To avoid the risk of exposure, it is best to prepare food for your roommate and deliver it to their room. Once they&#8217;ve eaten, carry all dirty dishes and whatever else they might have touched with gloves on. Sanitize everything they&#8217;ve touched in hot water before you wash them. You can do your roomi&#8217;s laundry with gloves on as well. Once you&#8217;ve rinsed them, you can wash their load with yours without any risk of exposure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Quarantine yourself too</h2>



<p>If you live in a household where coronavirus is present, you should avoid going out too. Even if one roommate has COVID symptoms, opt for no contact deliveries for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-covid-essentials-to-keep-at-home-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID essentials</a> or ask a neighbor or friend to help. Stay in with your roommate, even if you don&#8217;t feel sick. After they&#8217;ve recovered, all members of your household should self-quarantine for another two weeks, at least.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Keep up with high standards of hygiene</h2>



<p>Make sure you frequently sanitize all countertops and surfaces your roommate might be coming in contact with. Except for entering their confined spaces, disinfect the other areas regularly. It would be best if you also practiced washing hands more often to stay safe.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Stay alert, but do not panic!</h2>



<p>A situation like this could be panic-inducing, but don&#8217;t give in to the panic. What has happened has happened. The best thing you could do is be there for your friend while keeping your mental peace. It may feel like you have a lot on your plate if your roommate falls sick with the coronavirus, but remember that you&#8217;re strictly adhering to guidelines for your own health too.</p>



<p>These are trying times, but trust that you&#8217;ll come out of this victoriously!</p>

<p>So you&#8217;re a big animal lover, and adopting a furry friend has been on your mind forever now. With all this newfound time on our hands now, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-manage-anxiety-stress-amid-a-pandemic-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">as the pandemic keeps us indoors</a>, it&#8217;s only natural to want to adopt a pet.

<p>The questions that can be asked here are endless. Being careful about the process should you be your topmost priority. Here are some things you must ask the animal lover in you, as you make your decision to adopt a pet. </p>

<p>Adopting a pet is a lifetime of commitment. Some say it is as good as adopting a baby. In the initial excitement, it&#8217;s easy to forget that caring for a pet is expensive and time-consuming. </p>



<p>You will have to be willing to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">organize your finances</a> to invest the money as well as the time to give your pet the lifestyle they deserve. At this point, you need to revaluate your lifestyle and see if it aligns with a pet&#8217;s basic needs. Being a responsible pet lover also comes with making monthly budgets, time schedules, and talk to a friend who already has a furry companion to get a more hands-on perspective.</p>

<p><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/12/adoptions-dogs-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">There&#8217;s been a noted surge in adoptions ever since the coronavirus pandemic hit us</a>. While this is excellent news for shelters across the globe &#8211; adopting a pet due to the lockdown may not be viable in the long run. Our lives will resume soon, and the pandemic will settle, leaving our pets at home alone. The most common reason for abandonment in pets is the level of commitment. So be 110% sure with or without the coronavirus self-isolation influencing your decision.</p>

<p>If you are ready to be adopted by a cute little furry, search for your forever friend using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.petango.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Petango</a>. But before you dive into this really fantastic search engine by Petango &#8211; you need to get permission from some relevant parties.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check with your parents/roommates/flatmates. </h3>



<p>Although this is an independent decision, a pet will influence the lives of whoever you are sharing your accommodation with. Get their consent before you bring in your new roommate!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check with your landlord</h3>



<p> Ask about <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/five-common-questions-about-renters-rights-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">your rights as a renter</a> &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to surprise them after all. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re lucky, your landlord will be an animal lover just as you are. But with some, it is a big no-no.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t sneak in a pet ever! Instead, indulge in an honest conversation with them and give them plenty of information about your new friend. Tell them the pet&#8217;s breed, size, age, temperament, and reason for adopting (send them cute photos too, for extra bonus points). </p>



<p>Tell them you will be investing a lot of time into training the pet. Furthermore, make it known that if the pet does any damages, you will take responsibility for it &#8211; make sure you stick to this promise when the time comes!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;<strong>Before you get a dog</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>you can&#8217;t quite imagine</strong>&nbsp;what living with&nbsp;<strong>one</strong>&nbsp;might be like; afterward,&nbsp;<strong>you can&#8217;t imagine</strong>&nbsp;living any other way.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to do, then!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Foster them babies!</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re not just helping the animal but also the shelters. Shelters are overburdened with sick and abandoned animals. When you help them, you&#8217;re reducing the shelter&#8217;s burden and making space for new animals. </p>



<p>Most shelter animals share a painful past of abuse, abandonment, and rejection &#8211; fostering helps them meet loving individuals like you and helps them recover from their unfortunate past. Fostering saves lives, it will give you a chance to help a furry and be helped in many ways.</p>



<p><em><strong>Adopt! If you can&#8217;t adopt, Foster. If you can&#8217;t foster, Sponsor! If you can&#8217;t sponsor, Volunteer! If you can&#8217;t volunteer, Donate. If you can&#8217;t donate, Educate! Everyone has the ability to change a shelter animal&#8217;s life &#8211; be their voice!</strong></em></p>

<p>The current coronavirus pandemic has changed the job market overnight. Offices expect to remain shut during the entire course of the Covid-19 pandemic. And we all adapted to new routines as the pandemic impacted job security, employment, and the economy. Among all the pain we witnessed globally, we at Roomi found ourselves wondering about the jobs that people lost. And by extension, the jobs that were in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>However, a quarter of the American workforce has filed for unemployment benefits. Many brand new employment positions have sprung up and are in high demand. And these new jobs have been in demand since the Covid-19 pandemic hit us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The new jobs created during the Covid-19 pandemic.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">COVID-19 testers: a job in high demand.</h3>



<p>Test workers conduct swab tests at hospitals or nursing homes, and even factories and offices. Registered nurses and nursing assistants will qualify for the roles, and they can expect a pay of around $45 an hour. If one invests their skill in training, then these positions are open for them. We can expect this role to be in demand for quite a while. Especially as factories and offices will require constant testing during and after Covid-19, as we continue to fight this pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you&#8217;re prepared for the unexpected, you can readily embrace last-minute accidents or a change of plans without feeling like you&#8217;re losing control. Earlier this year, we saw how COVID-19 sneaked up on us, reshaping our society in lasting ways. When an emergency strikes, it&#8217;s never expected. It could be an earthquake, or a family member falling ill. Even losing power for a few days is unthinkable, and we wonder about basic essentials.</p>



<p>Also, chances are you might be working from home. And so, now with all of the above in mind, it makes sense to stock up mindfully for an eventuality. Now is the time for preparation – not to panic. Even if your local stores are open and stocked, you want to avoid crowded places and maintain distancing. While toilet paper and bottled water are flying off shelves, the list of COVID essentials is longer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Shelf-stable food, groceries </h2>



<p>Before purchasing food, check expiration dates, and plan out your consumption. Keep food allergies in mind and take only the necessities.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Canned goods</li><li>Pasta</li><li>Cereals</li><li>Crackers</li><li>Granola bars</li><li>Dried fruits</li><li>Dehydrated foods&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mountainhouse.com/m/shelf-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like this 24-serving bucket with a shelf life of 30 years</a></li><li><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=lp_16310101_nr_n_17?fst=as%3Aoff&amp;rh=n%3A16310101%2Cn%3A%2116310211%2Cn%3A16322721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Chips, crackers, nuts</a></li><li>Other fun (but also healthy) food</li></ul>



<p>Non-perishable foods are a must for plenty of potential emergencies; they&#8217;re perfect COVID essentials food-wise. Protein bars and dehydrated fruit have long shelf lives and deliver high energy despite their small size.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Drinking water</h2>



<p>If you do not have a water filter and your tap water is unfit to drink, you could stock bottled drinking water. As per the Department of Homeland Security, on average, a person requires half to one gallon of water per day. But it depends on you to decide how many days of water supply you need.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Prescription medications</h2>



<p>You can stock or refill essential drugs vital to you with the help of your doctor and pharmacist. This way, you avoid venturing out. This is especially helpful with the elderly at home as they are the most vulnerable when it comes to COVID-19. Also, you may want to consider some First-Aid kits as the time taken for ER admissions just keeps increasing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Toiletries</h2>



<p>If you have a particular skincare routine that depends on specific products, now is the time to buy a few months&#8217; worths of those toiletries. All over the world, supply chains are being disrupted by the pandemic. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you need to worry about running out of basic essentials like soap, which many different companies make. However, non-essential toiletries, especially those made by smaller companies, might be out of stock for weeks or months. Here&#8217;s a list of basic toiletries that you should have:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Toothpaste</li><li>Shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Contact solution</li><li>Deodorant</li><li>Antibacterial soap</li><li>Hand Sanitizer with a high alcohol content</li><li>Toilet paper</li><li>Tissues</li><li>Disinfecting wipes</li><li>Sanitary napkins/tampons/other feminine care products</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Cash for necessities </h2>



<p>The pandemic has brought in erratic incomes and uncertain months ahead, putting hard cash among COVID essentials. Jobs are at risk, and everyone is worried about second waves and more lockdowns. So, it is always good to keep some extra cash at home and in your bank in these tough times. You should limit yourself to essential spending, at least for the time being.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Good healthy practices</h2>



<p>It may not be enough to have all that you need. Preventive steps with disease management is a good practice done regularly. During COVID-19, you will want to:</p>

<p>Expect the return to normalcy to take a few months – plan for the entertainment and stable mental health of everyone at home. Consider doing the following during COVID-19 quarantines:</p>
