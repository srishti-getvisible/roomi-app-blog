										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;ve found yourself here, you know NYC&#8217;s rental market is as competitive as a rental market can get. And in most competitive rental markets, tenants usually end up dealing with middlemen known as brokers. Apartments in New York have known the broker&#8217;s fee for a long time. The pandemic caused shifts in the rental market of 2020. And the consequences were felt by anyone dealing with renting in NYC.</p>

<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-rental-fees-can-landlord-legally-charge/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Apartment Rental Fees Can My Landlord Legally Charge Me?</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the standard broker&#8217;s fee in NYC?</h2>



<p>Brokers in NYC have near-absolute control over apartment listings, viewing appointments, and leases. In return for their services, <strong>broker&#8217;s fees in NYC can be as much as 15% on the annual lease.</strong> This is typically paid in one lump sum by tenants before they can move in.</p>



<p>With the pandemic changing things, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/big-drop-in-manhattan-rental-prices-lures-back-younger-residents.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC reported that the prices to rent and buy property in NYC dropped</a> so much that younger renters were found returning to the area.</p>



<p>However, low rent prices quickly turned into high broker fees. It&#8217;s also important to note that NYC is one of the few cities in the country with a broker industry. And it&#8217;s one of the few cities that has financial leverage over how people rent apartments.</p>



<p>Brokers used the new surge in renters to their advantage and started charging high fees. Earlier this year, charging a broker&#8217;s fee was banned in the city, but it was a temporary ban.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is the broker&#8217;s fee in NYC legal?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1602325978229-fc2d478ffba7?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="rent in NYC is a highly competitive, especially close to areas like radio city where the broker's fee in NYC itself is 15% of the annual rent"/></figure>



<p>In early February of 2020, the New York State effectively eliminated broker&#8217;s fees. NYC state regulators said renters can no longer be charged broker fees. With the elimination of broker fees in NYC, the state of New York holds an extreme potential to become one of the most favorable rent locations in all of the US.</p>



<p>This new rule, buried in legal guidance on last year’s rent laws, caught lawmakers, many landlords, and brokers off guard. But it&#8217;s safe to say that the tenant advocates cheered the new broker fee rule. Mostly because it helps tilt an uneven real estate playing field.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why was the broker fee in NYC eliminated?</h2>



<p>This new law was primarily aimed at protecting tenants and strengthening rent regulations. It mentions that tenants can be charged no more than $20 in fees when applying for an apartment, including background and credit checks. Previous rent laws have also capped security deposits at one month’s rent, further diminishing the lump sum amount renters typically must pay before being given keys to an apartment.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that the burden for broker fees in NYC falls directly on the landlords. Or they can choose to list, market, and lease their units on their own. <strong>The changes could effectively turn New York’s rental market into a no-fee market.</strong> <strong>That is if renters choose to hunt for an apartment without hiring a broker.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where does the banning of broker&#8217;s fees in NYC stand today?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1602325978196-37650f5d3203?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="man in black jacket and black pants riding on black motorcycle on road during daytime on his way to pay broker's fee in NYC"/></figure>



<p>Much to our dismay, banning broker fees in NYC has proved to be a slow process, and experts believe it&#8217;s going to take much longer.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a temporary restraining order that blocks the new guidance on renting in NYC from taking effect, so if you’re in the process of renting an apartment, you’ll still have to pay the broker’s fee. A tenant would also have to pay the fee if they, rather than the landlord, hired a broker to help them find an apartment.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Now that there’s a legal challenge to the ruling—do I have to pay the broker&#8217;s fee or not?</h3>



<p>While the court process grinds along, the real estate market has changed significantly. And with rents dropping and working tenants harder to come by, broker fees — are at least for now — becoming scarce in areas like Manhattan. However, in other parts of the city, like Astoria, Queens, most of the listings are still asking for a fee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You don’t need “Game of Thrones” to tell you this, but winter is indeed coming. And that means those hot showers are about to become that much more important to get you through the days. Whether you’re in <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a> or San Francisco, a&nbsp;one-bedroom apartment in the heart of either city can easily cost over <a href="http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&amp;city1=New+York%2C+NY&amp;country2=United+States&amp;city2=San+Francisco%2C+CA" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3,000 a month</a>. And when you’re paying an arm and a leg to <i>rent</i> your home, it’s that much more important that you get your money’s worth. Having hot water is a fundamental right due to renters by their landlords, so if your taps are running cold, it’s important to speak up. But if you&#8217;re going to confront your landlord, it&#8217;s important to be aware of tenants&#8217; rights. So what do you do if a landlord isn’t providing the essentials, like hot water? What are your rights as a tenant under law?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tenants-rights-in-new-york-city">Tenants&#8217; rights in New York City</h3>



<p>In New York City, every landlord is required to&nbsp;provide adequate heat and hot water between Oct. 1 and May 31 (also known as the “Heat Season”), <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/important-safety-issues-heat-hot-water.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to NYC 311</a>. Hot water, however, <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/important-safety-issues-heat-hot-water.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">should be provided 365 days a year</a> and should be at least 120°. If you’re without either or both, you can report it to the City. Renters are also allowed to&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-things-to-do-if-you-cant-make-rent-roomi/">withhold rent</a> for such a grievance, according to Brooklyn-based <a href="http://streeteasy.com/blog/nyc-renters-rights-heat-hot-water/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">housing rights attorney Justin La Mort</a>. But don&#8217;t make that your first plant of action. NYC 311 recommends first contacting your landlord, managing agent or super to resolve the issue (remember to&nbsp;keep track of all written correspondence). If it still goes unresolved within a reasonable amount of time, let the City intervene on your behalf, recommends NYC realtor Collin Bond.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“If a tenant does not have hot water they should call 311 to file a complaint. This will trigger an investigation by the HPD (Housing Preservation &amp; Development). HPD will follow up with the owner or management company and the tenant to see if service has been restored.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If hot water <i>still</i> isn’t restored, your landlord could be subject to some serious fines.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The penalty for not providing hot water is $250 to $500 per day for each initial violation,” adds Bond, “and $500 to $1,000 for each subsequent violation at the same building during the same or next calendar year from the initial violation.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If the&nbsp;situation forces you out of your apartment (because cold showers in 15° weather is not OK), you still shouldn’t try to withhold rent. If you incur expenses because of the situation (i.e. you’re displaced and have to go to a hotel, etc.) make sure to keep all receipts, pay your rent, and seek legal counsel. Taking your landlord to court isn’t the ideal situation, but it is your right if push comes to shove. To learn about all your rights as a tenant under law, visit the <a href="http://metcouncilonhousing.org/help_and_answers/statutory_rights_of_residential_tenants_in_new_york">Metropolitan Council on Housing</a>&nbsp;website.  </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tenants-rights-in-san-francisco">Tenants&#8217; rights in San Francisco</h3>



<p>Like NYC, San Francisco law requires that a landlord provide hot water to their tenants, as apart of their responsibility to maintain “habitability” of their residences. Heat should be available and maintained at 68° between 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. or 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Hot water should always be available and maintained at a temperature of 105° to 120°, according to SF311.&nbsp;If you’re without hot water in San Francisco, you can technically withhold rent. But just like in NYC, you should never resort to this first. Going on a rent strike could put you a at risk of an eviction for not paying.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“If you use this option, the landlord may fix the problem or attempt to evict you for nonpayment of rent and you will have to go to court and adequately prove the seriousness of the problem and the landlord’s failure to do anything about it,” says the San Francisco Tenants Union website.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Instead, report the issue to your landlord and document the correspondence. If your landlord doesn’t fix your hot water in a timely manner, you should contact the<a href="http://sfdbi.org/"> Department of Building Inspection</a>. Expect the city to inspect within one business day. Continue documenting every correspondence, and ask for a copy of the report for your records. But be careful if you live in an illegal <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/nyc-landlords-never-empty-apartment/">apartment</a>. The DBI could shut down the apartment building altogether. That would lead to an automatic eviction. </p>



<p>If you can show the landlord knew of the issues and did not repair them in a timely manner, you can repair the damage yourself and deduct what you spent from your rent. But again, you risk an eviction notice based on nonpayment of rent, and you could end up in court. Therefore, it’s not advised to do this, and you may be better off pursuing legal action. Ultimately, it’s never a good idea to withhold rent until you’ve spoken to a lawyer. Organizations like the San Francisco Tenants Union, Housing Rights Committee of SF and SF311 are great resources for more information and counsel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tenant-law-in-other-cities">Tenant law in other cities</h3>



<p>Don’t live in NYC or SF? Your landlord still has to provide you hot water. Find your city’s tenants&#8217; rights or housing authority website to learn what the laws are. You have rights as a tenant under law to live in a habitable environment . That means your landlord must do their part to provide it.</p>
