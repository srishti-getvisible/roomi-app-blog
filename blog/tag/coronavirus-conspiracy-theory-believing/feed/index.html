<p>It&#8217;s been close to a year that we&#8217;ve been in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic. With every major event, comes an equally weird conspiracy theory. The ever-rising poll of deaths, fatalities, and unemployment has accompanied a mirage of emotions.  Add to that mix a coronavirus conspiracy theory believing Roomi? Yikes!</p>



<p>Although most of us do believe in one conspiracy theory or another, maybe it&#8217;s time to review how we fall prey to them, especially when a conspiracy theory threatens to risk ours and our loved one&#8217;s health (in the case of the coronavirus conspiracy).</p>



<p>So to level with a conspiracy theory-believing roomi, we need to try and fit ourselves into their shoes to understand how the plague-like conspiracies come alive.</p>

</div></figure>

<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:50%">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Karen Douglas, a professor at the University of Kent in this <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180124-the-enduring-appeal-of-conspiracy-theories">BBC</a><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180124-the-enduring-appeal-of-conspiracy-theories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180124-the-enduring-appeal-of-conspiracy-theories" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>, says that people who are easily swayed by conspiracy theories have a need for uniqueness, and they get a thrill in knowing something or having access to information that other people seemingly don&#8217;t.</em></p></blockquote>



<p></p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:50%">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Other studies say conspiracy theories are a mechanism to make sense of a world when people feel anxious, powerless, or out of control concerning a situation, which is why conspiracy theories concerning the pandemic are still on a steady rise.</em></p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>



<p>Now that we understand and somehow can even relate to our coronavirus conspiracy theory believing roomis, we can look at some ways to talk to them about it without getting into a heated debate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Do not disapprove of their conspiracy theory beliefs (even if you strongly do)</h2>



<p>Simply rejecting a person&#8217;s belief (whether they&#8217;re right or wrong) will make their belief even stronger. The science behind this is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/role-cognitive-dissonance-pandemic/614074/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive dissonance</a>. When your brain is faced with two contradicting ideas (one being what you believe in and the other, a fact that is the opposite), your brain will choose to hold stronger to your own belief rather than accepting you were wrong.</p>



<p>As Psychologist Stephan Lewandowsky says, “Any evidence against a conspiracy theory is reinterpreted as evidence in favor of it.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qp20O9KAuL"><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/top-6-2020-podcast-picks-for-the-pandemic-roomi/">Top 6 2020 Podcast Picks for The Pandemic</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Top 6 2020 Podcast Picks for The Pandemic&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog" src="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/top-6-2020-podcast-picks-for-the-pandemic-roomi/embed/#?secret=qp20O9KAuL" data-secret="qp20O9KAuL" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Try to have an open-minded conversation with your conspiracy theory believing Roomi</h2>



<p>If you can&#8217;t change their point of view, the least you can do is try and understand it. Show your coronavirus conspiracy theory believing roomi that you&#8217;re willing to change your opinion if they can state facts related to what they believe in.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ll stop believing in their preferred conspiracy theory about the pandemic. Still, it might spark a conversation that could make them rethink their belief of a coronavirus conspiracy &#8211; For example, How exactly do 5g towers spread coronavirus? Have they read any studies related to them?</p>



<p>Start with &#8216;I&#8217;d love to read studies related to your belief&#8217; instead of &#8216;I&#8217;d believe you only if you prove it.&#8217;</p>



<p>A healthy debate about the conspiracy theory over a couple of beers or some cocktails can be more effective than an argument. Convince them that you don&#8217;t know what to believe in, and they might accept the same.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EMblgLtlXf"><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-work-from-home-with-roommates-roomi/">How to Work from Home with Roommates</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;How to Work from Home with Roommates&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog" src="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-work-from-home-with-roommates-roomi/embed/#?secret=EMblgLtlXf" data-secret="EMblgLtlXf" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Tell them you&#8217;re concerned about your health and theirs</h2>



<p>Try telling them it&#8217;s not the belief you worry about, but your collective health.  The emotional appeal of it might help in convincing your Roomi.</p>



<p>Try and put forth that in the likelihood that coronavirus isn&#8217;t a conspiracy. There really isn&#8217;t much harm in staying indoors or wearing a mask to protect yourself and your loved ones.</p>



<p>Instead of telling them they&#8217;re wrong and you&#8217;re right, talk about how and why the situation worries you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The conversation is going nowhere: put an end to it!</h2>



<p>So you keep coming back to my belief is better than yours. And it&#8217;s of no use to either of you.</p>



<p>When you start a conspiracy theory-related conversation about the pandemic with your roomi, there&#8217;s one thing to keep in mind. The only way to know if it&#8217;s healthy is when there&#8217;s no condescension and yelling involved.</p>



<p>The moment you realize they&#8217;re not ready to back down, it might be time to let go. Finally, if they insist on hosting a coronavirus party to disprove your belief, it&#8217;s time to stop trying to understand.</p>



<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s time to think of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-tell-roommates-moving-out/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">moving out</a> till things settle down. No coronavirus conspiracy theory is worth your health and safety!</p>
