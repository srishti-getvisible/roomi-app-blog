<p>The microwave oven is a truly magical appliance that can both heat up and make food. Especially the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/7-binge-worthy-netflix-shows-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix binge-er&#8217;s</a> best friend &#8211; POPCORN &#8211; in a minute! They are super useful and deserve the same love they offer to us. On this Microwave Oven Day, shower your appliance with affection with these microwave cleaning hacks. Ever heard of the lemon microwave cleaning hack? Or just looking for a chemical-free microwave cleaning hack? We got you!</p>



<p>Have you ever wondered how microwave ovens were invented?</p>



<p><strong>Well, like all great things, the invention of the microwave was an accident and not an intention!</strong></p>



<p><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a19567/how-the-microwave-was-invented-by-accident/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raytheon engineer Henry Spencer</a> was busy testing a military-grade magnetron when he suddenly realized that the snack in his pocket had melted.</strong></p>



<p>If you&#8217;re wondering what a radar magnetron is &#8211; it&#8217;s a sort of electric whistle that, instead of creating sound, creates vibrating electromagnetic waves (the ones that make TVs, radios, and microwave ovens work).</p>



<p>One day at work in 1946, as he was testing one of his magnetrons, the peanut cluster bar in his pocket (that he used to feed squirrels every day) had completely melted. And as Spencer said, &#8220;It was a gooey, sticky mess.&#8221;</p>



<p>And speaking of gooey, sticky messes, our microwave ovens do get messy from time to time. From spilled milk to greasy food shavings stuck on the microwave oven&#8217;s plate, we all tell ourselves we&#8217;ll get back to cleaning it later.</p>



<p>But now, as microwave oven day comes and goes, let&#8217;s learn how to take better care of our microwave oven without putting in much effort!</p>



<p>YES, there&#8217;s an entire day dedicated to honoring the microwave oven and how it&#8217;s changed the way we cook!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Cleaning your microwave oven from the inside out</h2>



<p>There are a number of cleaning hacks to get the job done. So to make it easier, we&#8217;re listing some of our favorite tips here.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Sauna bath:</strong> Take a bunch of thick tissues, dip them in a bowl of water to make them damp and then place them inside the microwave. Then simply turn your microwave oven on. Think of it like giving your microwave a hot sauna bath! Once you do this, all the grimy, greasy and stubborn food droppings will become loose and be ready to be wiped away!</li><li><strong>Baking soda mask:</strong> If your food droppings are stubborn enough to withstand the sauna bath cleaning hack, don&#8217;t fret. Simply mix 2 teaspoons baking soda with one teaspoon water and apply the paste to the stubborn food droppings stuck to your microwave oven. Let it sit for a little while and wipe it clean!</li><li><strong>Beautifully clean inside out:</strong> When the insides are done, wipe down your greasy microwave oven window and door with a wet washcloth. If the dirt is stubborn, use a mixture of vinegar and water to make them sparkly clean so you can peep inside while your food is getting ready.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lbESdZdAun"><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/8-cheap-bathroom-cleaning-hacks-to-ease-your-chore-roomi/">8 Easy and Cheap Bathroom Cleaning Hacks You Wish You Knew Before</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;8 Easy and Cheap Bathroom Cleaning Hacks You Wish You Knew Before&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog" src="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/8-cheap-bathroom-cleaning-hacks-to-ease-your-chore-roomi/embed/#?secret=lbESdZdAun" data-secret="lbESdZdAun" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Is something burning?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re still <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/10-life-lessons-learned-from-cooking-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">learning how to cook</a>, you might be burning more food than actually making it. It&#8217;s also natural for particles of burnt food to stick itself to the inside of your microwave.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>To delete the history of your midnight cravings, leave the microwave oven door open overnight and let it air out. </li><li>For stubborn smells, leave a bowl of baking soda inside the microwave. It will help absorb any nasty smells.</li></ul>



<p>There is a chemical-free microwave cleaning hack you can try as well.</p>



<p>If you want a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-ways-to-make-your-home-smell-good-naturally-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh smell</a> coming from the microwave, give it a citrus makeover! </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The lemon microwave cleaning hack is a trade secret. </li><li>Combine one cup of water with a freshly squeezed lemon or orange juice in a microwave-friendly bowl. </li><li>Place it inside your microwave oven and let the mix boil and steam up. </li><li>Let it cool for a little while and voila! The lemon microwave cleaning hack is officially your savior.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Additional tips to take care of your microwave</h2>



<p>Cleaning hacks are one thing, but when it comes to our beloved microwave oven, we want it to last long and stay in good shape so it can keep you company on <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/lazy-roomi-cooking-9-recipes-for-slow-lazy-days-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">lazy days</a>. So here are some everyday maintenance tips to keep your microwave as good as new:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Always check the labels on your containers to see whether they&#8217;re microwave safe before you put them inside.</li><li>Don&#8217;t put aluminum foil, metal or dishware with gold or silver rims inside.</li><li>Never slam your microwave door shut as it can damage the door or even fuse the light of your microwave.</li><li>If your microwave sits on a shelf in your kitchen, make sure to keep the area clean and tidy, and with good air circulation.</li><li>Keep your microwave oven unplugged when not in use to protect it from power surges.</li><li>Know when to call for professional help!</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the most exciting things about moving to a new city or neighborhood are the restaurants you get to add to your must-try list. (Chances are there are a handful of mouthwatering places on your block alone.) But as much those dollar slices and falafels are calling your name, your wallet and waistline will take a major hit if you aren’t equipped to prepare some of your meals in your shared kitchen. That&#8217;s when you obsessively start looking up kitchen hacks and quick recipes and you end up here. </p>



<p>So, where do you go from here? While we’d all love to go on a massive shopping spree through William Sonoma, the moving process doesn’t leave much wiggle room in the budget for kitchen gadgets. So we checked in with the pros to see what they put on their list of must-haves when stocking a new kitchen. These essentials can mean the difference between an ever-growing takeout bill (and pant size) and delicious, homemade meals in minutes. Here are the first five things nutritionists buy when stocking a new shared kitchen, with our top picks for the splurge vs. steal. Grab a pot, some groceries and your roommate — it’s time to cook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Get a toaster oven for your shared kitchen</h2>



<p>So basic, and yet so useful, the&nbsp;toaster oven will become your new best friend on nights when your roommate decides to finally give that fancy 20-step Pinterest recipe a try (hogging all the pots and pans), or on days you get tied up at the office and just want to whip up an easy meal. In fact, some of the easiest <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi/">kitchen hacks</a> involve a toaster oven!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The kitchen gadgets that really count are those that get to take up the precious real estate on the countertops.. My first choice is a toaster oven. Unlike a toaster, with a toaster oven you can heat up items you might otherwise need to put in an oven (like a slice of pizza) or dinners in metal containers that you aren’t able to put in the microwave, and cook items to a delicious crispness (like roasted potatoes).&nbsp;You can make a quick meal for one by baking a chicken cutlet in the toaster oven — just place on a tray and add some seasoning, a drizzle of balsamic glaze and a drop of olive oil. Add to a salad and you’ll have a great, low calorie lunch or dinner.”</p><cite><a href="http://www.bonnietaubdix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bonnie Taub-Dix, RD</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:</strong>&nbsp;<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-TOB-40-Classic-Toaster-Broiler/dp/B004JMZGM2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler</a>, $79.95</span><br> <strong>Steal</strong>: Black &amp; Decker Black Toaster Oven, $29.99</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Food Processor</h2>



<p>Not only does it store easily in a small cabinet, but this handy gadget will majorly cut down on meal prep time. You can chop and mince ingredients in minutes. It&#8217;s one of the greatest kitchen hacks ever! Plus, think of all the smoothies you’ll be making in your shared kitchen!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“A must-have pick for my first kitchen was a small, countertop food processor — not a huge, expensive KitchenAid, but a tiny one that’s perfect for a super small apartment or studio. In fact, I still use my tiny processor all the time in my current kitchen, which is larger than my first&#8230; Having a food processor of any size is a must if you plan to make vegetables a regular part of your meal plan, which of course we all should! If you’re very short on space, it can even sub as a small blender (you can make smoothies in it!) and it’s great for making servings for one, so if you live on your own you don’t feel like you’re going to have large amounts of food waste.”</p><cite><a href="http://www.erinpalinski.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Erin Palinski-Wade, RD</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:&nbsp;</strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-DLC-10SY-Classic-7-Cup-Processor/dp/B01AXM4SB6/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Cuisinart+DFP-14BCN+Food+Processor&amp;qid=1618373987&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFWU0NYUFk5V0ZIMDYmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA3NzMyNzY2TE1HUFFaR0M5RjYmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDQxMjk2NTFSWjVGMjQ1QjFMSUUmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuisinart DFP14BCN Food Processor, 14 Cup</a>, $119.95&nbsp;<strong><br> Steal: </strong>Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Food Processor, 3-Cup, $39.95</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Dutch oven is a must for your shared kitchen</h2>



<p>A Dutch oven is the perfect addition to a co-living household and those awesome potluck dinners you’re dying to have. But make sure to choose a vibrant color. So, the nest time you host friends for a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi/">dinner</a>, you can bring it right to the table! Save yourself a dirty dish. That&#8217;s one of the most useful kitchen hacks out there!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“One of my first, and most essential purchases, was my big 7-quart Dutch oven. It’s still a fixture in my kitchen, some 8 years later&#8230; As a graduate student, I used it to make all sorts of one-pot meals to get me through the week, like soups, stews, hearty pasta sauces, and curried chicken. It also doubles as a kitchen decor piece if you leave it out on the stove — I didn’t have enough cupboard space in my tiny studio to hide it away, anyway!”</p><cite><a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/johannah-sakimura-nutrition-sleuth/author/johannahsakimura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Johannah Sakimura, RD</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:</strong> <a href="https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/le-creuset-signature-oval-dutch-oven/" class="broken_link">Le Creuset Cast Iron 3.5-Qt. Wide Oval Dutch Oven</a>, $350</p>



<p><strong>Steal:</strong>&nbsp;Threshold Cast Iron Dutch Oven – 3 Qt., $29.99</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Blender</h2>



<p>No shared kitchen is complete without a blender. It’s the first item that <a href="http://www.francicohen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Franci Cohen</a>, certified nutritionist and personal trainer, stocks in a new kitchen. The appliance won’t take up precious real estate, and is essential to whipping up <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/nyc-gardening-hacks-herbs-to-grow-in-your-apartment/">smoothies</a>. And that&#8217;s a super easy way to up your fruit and veggie intake. Plus, If you’re one of those people who play whack-a-mole with their alarm clock every morning, your blender will ensure you have a filling and tasty breakfast to grab on the go – even when you have literally one minute to spare. You won&#8217;t need to search for kitchen hacks anymore after this purchase!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The night before, toss some Greek yogurt, skim milk, kale or spinach, banana, berries and almond butter in the blender bowl, cover and place in your fridge. In the morning, whip up your smoothie for a powerhouse breakfast loaded with vitamins, minerals, protein and calcium to keep you from visiting the vending machine before lunch.”</p><cite><strong><a href="http://www.bonnietaubdix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bonnie Taub-Dix, RD</a></strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>While smoothies may be the first thing that come to mind when reaching for the blender, that’s only scratching the surface.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Use it to make vegetable juices, soups, salad dressing and marinades for lean meat — even cocktails! You can also use it to create healthy white flour alternatives from healthy grains such as oats.”</p><cite><strong>Franci Cohen, RD</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ninja-BL660-Professional-Blender/dp/B00939FV8K/ref=sr_1_4?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444792364&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=blender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ninja Professional Blender</a>, $112.99<br> <strong>Steal:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-58148A-Multi-Function-Blender/dp/B00EI7DPI0/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444792364&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=blender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hamilton Beach Power Elite Multi-Function Blender</a>, $26.85</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Chef’s Knife</h2>



<p>You won’t get very far prepping a healthy meal without a good knife.   Sakimura counts as one of her most essential early purchases.&nbsp;If you go for the splurge and invest in a high-quality knife, Sakimura recommends getting it professionally sharpened once a year. Your shared kitchen will immediately feel like a professional kitchen with a good chef&#8217;s knife!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I bought an 8″ chef’s knife, which is a great all-purpose knife. I went with the Wusthof Classic Ikon because I loved the weight and clean design. Talk about a good investment! I still use it almost daily, eight years later, and it has held up beautifully, despite slicing more than its fair share of produce, including countless watermelons and butternut squashes (I’m a nutritionist after all!) I’m sure I should have it done more frequently, but it seems to hold up fine!”</p><cite> <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/johannah-sakimura-nutrition-sleuth/author/johannahsakimura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Johannah Sakimura, RD</a> </cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:</strong> Wüsthof Classic Ikon Chef’s Knives, $139.99-$199.95<br> <strong>Steal:</strong> Wüsthof Pro Chef’s Knife, 8″, $24.95</p>
