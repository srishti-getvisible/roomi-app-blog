<p>Clinton Hill is a neighborhood in north-central Brooklyn, a borough of New York City. It&#8217;s next to the Brooklyn Navy Yard and is known as &#8220;The Hill&#8221; because of its elevation of 95 feet (29 metres) — the highest in the area.</p>



<p>Clinton Hill is one of the best places to live in New York. Because of its history as an affluent area, it&#8217;s a tranquil residential neighborhood with tree-lined avenues and lovely homes. Midrise brick flats and condominiums now lie across the street from magnificent brownstones, carriage homes, and freestanding mansions in what has become a more equitable area. If you&#8217;re looking for rooms for rent in Clinton Hill, now&#8217;s the time to move.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Walkability</h3>

This is a huge advantage if you&#8217;re looking for rooms for rent in Clinton Hill because you can easily walk from place to place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nearby Train Station</h3>

The city never ceases to marvel and captivate its travelers and even folks living in NYC itself. Contrary to what most people think, there&#8217;s more to the city than untouchable concrete peaks and the fast-paced life. It also offers delicious food, relaxing green scapes, and a touch of blue for all the water babies out there. There&#8217;s never a dull beat in New York City.</p>

<p>If Manhattan is XS and Brooklyn M, then <em>Queens is XL.</em> Notably, in all departments. An extra-large palate of food, diversity, and also <em>literally in size!</em> Queens is the largest and the most diverse of all the five boroughs in New York. The borough encapsulates a beautiful medley of cultures and experiences, which is a result of residents from far lands calling Queens their home.</p>

<p>Get your fill (quite literally) when you visit Queens. The borough is famous for many breweries that you can&#8217;t miss. Many tourists and folks living in NYC get their fill from the exquisite authentic cultural food. From mouth-watering street food, Asian &amp; Mediterranean delicacies to one of the best Greek restaurants – Taverna Kyclades. Honestly, you can&#8217;t stop eating&#8230;*speaks with a mouthful*&#8230;when you&#8217;re in Queens!</p>

<p>The borough is a favorite among nature lovers, history fanatics, sports fans, and modern-art aficionados. If you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s living in NYC, you can&#8217;t deny seeing the large Pepsi-Cola sign that draws many influencers and tourists from around the world. It&#8217;s quite cute!</p>

<p>Want a spot you can enjoy art and a picnic at the same time? Head to&nbsp;<a href="https://socratessculpturepark.org/">The Socrates Sculptural Park</a>, an outdoor space where sculptors showcase their best work in 3D. When it&#8217;s time to hop back on the tour and explore more of Queens, you can tap on your New York Guide&#8217;s shoulder – that&#8217;s me! Some other cool places to visit are the Noguchi Museum and the famous modern art museum MoMA PS1.</p>



<p>If you love being in or next to water, make sure to visit the Rockaway beach that allows surfers (in summers). The beach has breweries and great food to relish while checking out the majestic views. Oh s<em>o pretty!</em></p>



<p>As your New York Guide, here are my top recommendations when visiting Queens:</p>

<p>The beautiful island is only a scenic ferry ride away. As your New York Guide, I must express how much I personally love Staten Island. It&#8217;s the greenest borough; a magical Narnia escape within the city (minus the white witch, which at this point is probably the pandemic). Staten Island offers the most stunning views, beaches, immersive Maritime history, and even a fully preserved colonial village. Hop on folks, we are taking the ferry!</p>

<p>Home to music and baseball lovers. This borough encapsulates a rich history and the inception of two of the most cherished and loved experiences in the world today – Hip Hop and Team Yankees! The&nbsp;**Bronx once homed legends and hip hop masters like Grandmaster Flash from Morrisania, DJ Afrika Bambaataa from Bronx River Houses, DJ Kool Herc from the Sedgwick Avenue. These artists and many others played an instrumental role (quite literally) in making the hip hop genre what it is today.</p>

<p>We are now at the most iconic (and most expensive) borough of New York. For instance, the feel and the whimsical magic of skyscrapers, blinding city lights, and famous movie sites will leave you in awe of this borough. Manhattan, most commonly referred to as &#8216;the city&#8217;, is also the business heartland of the USA.</p>



<p>If you look back at NYC&#8217;s history, some of the most crucial decisions were made in this borough. Moreover, the tall, untouchable peak of the Empire State Building continues to bring many dreamers to the city that never sleeps. Whether you&#8217;re a tourist or someone&nbsp;living in NYC, a visit to Times Square is a must. Especially at night, when the whole city seems to come alive as the billboards light up the central crossing and yellow taxis rush to get people where they need to go.</p>



<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong>&nbsp;Broadway was born in Manhattan!</p>



<p>Our top recommendation as your New York Guide while visiting Manhattan are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Empire State Building</li>



<li>Times Square</li>



<li>Wall Street</li>



<li>Broadway</li>



<li>Grand Central Terminal</li>



<li>Central Park</li>



<li>The High Line</li>



<li>Chelsea Market</li>
</ul>

<p>A haven for history buffs and hipsters, Brooklyn has something for everyone. While Manhattan is the epicenter of New York, Brooklyn is an epicenter for people living in NYC. This populous borough draws people in with live music, pro sports, rich heritage, delicious food, majestic places to unwind like Pebble beach, and the infamous Coney Island.</p>



<p>Brooklyn was once an independent city until it merged with NYC in 1898. Today, the borough retains its own artsy style, immigrant history, and multi-ethnic culture. As your New York Guide, allow us to add how awesome and diverse Brooklyn&#8217;s palate is. Not only do they have famous cheesecakes at Junior, they also have a large selection of vegan and kosher options – Brooklyn is literalllly every foodie&#8217;s dream come true.</p>



<p>Here are our top recommendations to visit as a tourist or even as someone who&#8217;s living in NYC:</p>
