<p>Built on seven hills, Rome is the capital city of Italy, with the largest population in the country. It&#8217;s known to be one of the oldest consistently inhabited cities in Europe and according to legend, was founded by Romulus and Remus, the twin sons of the god of Mars.</p>



<p>In the 1st century, Rome was known as &#8220;Roma Aeterna&#8221; (eternal city), and by the 2nd century, it was named the &#8220;Caput Mundi&#8221; (capital of the world). After that, within Europe&#8217;s early modern history, Rome was the center of literature, education, poetry, architecture, law, religion, philosophy, gastronomy and more.</p>



<p>Presently, in more modern times, Rome is known for its Mediterranean climate, with mild, humid winters and hot, dry summers.</p>

Friday and Saturday, 5:20 am to 1:30 am.</li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://romamobilita.it/it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azienda Tramvie e Autobus del Comune di Roma (ATAC)</a>: is a public transport company controlling most public lines in the city.

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://italyspecialty.coffee/lazio/rome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drink espresso</a>:</strong> Like the Romans do — cold espresso with loads of sugar in the hot summer months. Likewise, to blend in, order a cappuccino only for breakfast. Romans typically enjoy two to three espressos a day, and you can just have a shot of espresso or an espresso with a mound of steamed milk.</li><li><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rome.net/janiculum-hill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Climb Gianicolo</a>:</strong> Janiculum Hill offers views from the highest perspective to gaze at the city&#8217;s skyline. Locals gather here at sunset for romantic date nights, but there&#8217;s a long steep hike to get to this point, so it&#8217;s best to hire/ride a bicycle, scooter or car.</li><li><strong>Visit numerous historical, cultural <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rome.net/attractions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attractions</a>:</strong> Take selfies at each attraction, from Trevi Fountain to the Pantheon, and the numerous Roman baths. Ride your bicycle while looking for places for rent in Rome, or travel across the River Tiber and visit Trastevere, the Jewish Ghetto. Here you&#8217;ll find tons of eateries and bars on every side of the cobbled streets, for this reason, making it an attractive location to look for cheap rooms for rent in Rome!</li></ul>
