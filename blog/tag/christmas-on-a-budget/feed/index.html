										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 has taught us <em>a lot.</em> Firstly, that the cute pair of boots you&#8217;ve been eyeing up is no longer a priority. Let&#8217;s be honest, spending your dollars on items of clothing that won&#8217;t be seen by a soul in daylight is kind of pointless. The pandemic has also reminded us that our loved ones matter the most, and the holiday season is all about spending time with them, rather than the presents. With that in mind, the chances are you might be on the lookout for an affordable Christmas this year. But is Christmas on a budget even doable?</p>



<p>So, here are some simple yet effective ways to minimize expenditure and maximize fun on Christmas!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;The way you spend Christmas is far more important than how much.&#8221;</em></p><cite><em><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong></em></cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">?Make a Christmas budget</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/christmas-ugly-sweater-HBMCmtsPEUShG"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/HBMCmtsPEUShG/giphy.gif?resize=500%2C280&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ugly Christmas Sweater GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="500" height="280" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The first step to limit expenditure is to make a plan &#8211; and stick to it! Work out what you need/ want to purchase, and don&#8217;t get persuaded by extras that you don&#8217;t need. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what you will need to set aside for an affordable Christmas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Holiday Decorations</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/groceries-and-roommates-how-to-budget-better-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">solid dinner menu</a> for Christmas Day!</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Gifts and presents!</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Travel money, if needed!</li></ul>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve made a total, keep this aside from your regular day-to-day or monthly outgoings (things like groceries and rent!). Don&#8217;t go overboard with your budget just because it&#8217;s the festive period &#8211; remind yourself of student loans and other debts that will make you more mindful of your spending.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">?Save Up</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/XwRP4JkXOsPII"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/XwRP4JkXOsPII/giphy.gif?resize=310%2C310&#038;ssl=1" alt="Decorating Christmas Tree GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="310" height="310" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Even before Christmas has said Hello, it’s saying ‘Buy Buy.’&#8221; </em></p><cite><em><strong>Robert Paul</strong></em></cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Coupon codes</h3>



<p>Sites like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/trending/stores" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honey</a>,&nbsp;RetailMeNot&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rakuten.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rakuten</a>&nbsp;enable users to save extra cash with coupon codes and cool cashback deals. All you need to do is download a browser extension and make the most out of your rewards and discount codes when you next start online shopping. High five!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Be smart&#8230; and sneaky</h3>



<p>Typically most online stores offer a 10-20% discount to new subscribers, so make sure you sign up before you purchase for the first time! You could either find new sights to shop on or maybe get a little inventive (or sneaky!) with your email address. Hint hint&#8230; make a new email ID to reap multiple discounts.&nbsp;<em>Shhhhh&#8230; you didn&#8217;t hear this from us!</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sale time</h3>



<p>The end of November is the best time to shop for Christmas presents thanks to the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/black-friday-shopping-hacks-the-pandemic-edition-roomi/2346/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">amazing Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday sales.</a> From amazing savings on gadgets to clothing and more, now&#8217;s your chance to spend and save at the same time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">?&#xfe0f;Get creative with wrapping</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/hulu-cbs-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-l0MYw0DsFJc0kU0Jq"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/l0MYw0DsFJc0kU0Jq/giphy.gif?resize=400%2C275&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cbs Christmas GIF by HULU - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="400" height="275" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Ditch the traditional fancy wrapping, bows, and ribbons, especially as wrapping can add up pretty quickly! Instead, use simple brown paper, newspaper, or any other waste paper creatively to cover your presents in a budget &amp; eco-friendly fashion. You can use jute thread, pine leaves, or pressed flowers to make them look super beautiful. 100 points to Gryffindor for creativity!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">?Make gifting a personal experience</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/excited-pointing-shouting-11EjiLDatd0syA"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/11EjiLDatd0syA/giphy.gif?resize=300%2C167&#038;ssl=1" alt="Excited The Office GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="300" height="167" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Nothing touches the heart like handmade and customized presents. An expensive gift has its own charm but a handmade gift tugs on the heart strings and stays with your loved ones forever. Think small and meaningful &#8211; pass on heirlooms, gift camping, travel experiences or build something with your own hands. You could also try DIY present this year- painting, planting, or stitching. It&#8217;s time to get creative!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">?Spend time not money</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/theoffice-nbc-the-office-tv-803gfyLkytlpK8H1sr"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/803gfyLkytlpK8H1sr/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Season 2 Nbc GIF by The Office - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="400" /></a></div>

<p>2020 has been a challenging year for all of us, with world economies crashing, salary cuts, and people losing their jobs&#8230; not to mention the virus itself. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed to talk about your relationship with money this year! Also, don&#8217;t be disheartened if you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-make-money-for-the-holidays-pandemic-edition-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">can&#8217;t celebrate Christmas with the same zeal as last year</a> &#8211; remember that you&#8217;re a treasure to your friends and your family and just spending quality time with them is the single best present.</p>



<p>Celebrate the holiday season with warm meals, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/top-christmas-movies-on-netflix-to-watch-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">good company,</a> hymns &amp; carols, prayers for a better year, and heartwarming small presents.</p>
