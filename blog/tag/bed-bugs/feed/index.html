										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sharing your home with creepy-crawlies probably <em>hasn’t </em>made the top of your wish list. Pesky bed bugs continue to ignite stressful situations for New York City&#8217;s housing department, despite the fact that the council has put measures in place for preservation and development.</p>



<p>If you’re noticing unwanted guests popping up between your sheets, in your books, your clothes and just about everywhere else, what can you do? The sad fact is that even if your roommate has bed bugs, it becomes a problem for the entire housing apartment, because these pests travel fast &#8211; and almost <em>always</em> overstay their welcome…kind of like your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deal-roommates-significant-never-leaves/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate’s significant other who never leaves</a>!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are you sure the culprits really are bed bugs?</h2>



<p>There are a few ways to identify bed bugs. And knowing what you’re working with is the first step to eradicating the problem. Some common signs that you’re dealing with bed bugs are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Your roommate (and possibly yourself) is noticing itchy bites on their body. Bed bugs survive on the blood of humans or animals and, while their bites aren’t dangerous, they can be irritating. You may also notice small spots of blood on your bed sheets.</li><li>There are red or rusty-colored spots on the mattresses. Bed bugs can sit dormant for months without needing a feed, and some people don’t have a visible reaction to bites. That doesn’t mean these insects aren’t sharing your bed. Small stains or dots on your sheets or mattress could indicate bugs that have been squashed.</li><li>Small dark spots on sheets (about the size of a standard bullet point) could actually be excrement from bed bugs.</li><li>You’ve spotted live bed bugs in the wild; they’re usually translucent or dark brown in color, the size of a grain of rice, and oval-shaped with prominent legs.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">File a complaint with the landlord</h2>



<p><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/bedbugs-information-for-homeowners-and-tenants.page" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) has listed bedbugs as a Class B violation</a>. In short, that means that everyone has the right to a bedbug-free environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Class B violation indicates that bed bugs are considered hazardous. So it is the landlord’s legal duty to eradicate these little pests. If you have conclusive proof that your roommate is suffering from an infestation, it’s time to report the problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By law, landlords have to provide new residential tenants with a one-year bedbug infestation history for units and entire buildings. If they fail to provide this, you can file an official tenant complaint. Otherwise, once you report your bedbug problem, they have 30 days to deal with the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What if the landlord doesn&#8217;t do anything about it? </h3>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/getting-out-of-a-sitch-with-your-landlord-renting-in-la-part-2/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If the landlord refuses to cooperate</a>, consider contacting a tenant lawyer to understand the options available to you. </p>



<p>We don’t recommend staging a protest in the form of refusing to pay rent! Deal with these things properly, and the law will always be on your side.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can bed bugs travel within the apartment?</h2>



<p>So, your roommate or flatmate has somehow introduced bugs into their bedroom &#8211; and now it’s become your problem, too. Bed bugs are so tiny that they can travel in minute cracks in walls, easily spreading between rooms in accommodating environments. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bugging news: Bed bugs can infest non-bed items too!</h3>



<p>They also latch onto things like clothes, backpacks and other belongings. So it’s likely that if your roommate has bed bugs, you need to check your own space, too. Ignoring the problem can just worsen it! And you might even suffer sleepless nights that spin from the anxiety of being bitten.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So here&#8217;s what you need to do</h3>



<p>Whether or not you have insect bites, take the following steps to bust any bugs from your room:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Check your bedding and clothing for signs of bed bugs. </h4>



<p>A clear sign that you have bedbugs is if you have red bloody dots on your bedding and clothing. Once you&#8217;ve thoroughly checked for signs, create a record of your findings. (You can share this with a pest control professional, when the time comes.)</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Do your laundry </h4>



<p>Suspecting bed bugs on your clothes? Simply wash and dry them on a hot setting, or store them in a sealed plastic bag.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Seal all entryways for the little buggers</h4>



<p>Check all cracks and crevices with a flashlight. If you do find any bugs, scoop them out with a knife, crush them and throw them outside.</p>



<p>Seal crevices with caulk to prevent more insects from entering your space.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Call the pros for help</h4>



<p>Hire a pest control company if your landlord refuses to help. If this occurs, you’re within your rights to file a complaint with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development</p>



<p>Check out this <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/vector/bed-bug-guide.pdf" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">bed bug guide</a> for further information.</p>



<p>Sharing your space with unwanted critters can be stressful &#8211; affecting not only your skin, but your day-to-day life. The good news is that the responsibility falls on your landlord and the problem <em>can </em>be fixed! Report the issue as soon as you notice the signs to re-claim your bedroom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bed bugs are unspeakably gross. And in NYC,</span><a href="http://www.amny.com/news/bed-bugs-mutate-and-flourish-in-nyc-even-as-complaints-drop-experts-say-1.12072250" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bed bugs are mutating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As if the nasty little freeloaders weren’t durable enough, their shells are getting thicker. That reduces the effect of common insecticides, making them even tougher to evict from your apartment. Having them removed by the a professional pest control team in NYC</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">can cost</span><a href="https://www.angieslist.com/articles/how-much-does-bed-bug-extermination-cost.htm" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$500-$1500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or more. Since exterminating them is such a giant pain, the ideal solution is not to come down with them in the first place. So here are some tips on how you can avoid letting the worst roommate ever into your home.</span> </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Educate </b>yourself about bed bugs in NYC</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn about</span><a href="https://www.orkin.com/other/bed-bugs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bed bugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are 4-5mm long, or about the size of an apple seed. So they aren’t microscopic. You don’t have to bust out your high school pocket microscope to find them. They have only one item on the menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Blood. Yup. That’s it. Could these things possibly be any creepier? They can go for a year without eating. That . . . doesn’t even make sense, but there you have it. These bed bugs were made to survive NYC. These things are like aliens from another planet or something. They like mattresses, but not because they’re soft. They like dark crevices that offer lots of protection. Beds are a common party spot for them, but they can also be found gathering in other pieces of furniture, like chairs and tables. Or sheets. Even light sockets.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a</span><a href="https://bedbugtreatmentsite.com/bed-bug-misconceptions/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">common misconception</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that bed bugs only infest dirty places. It makes sense, at first glance. Dirty, polluted, filthy apartment? Please meet soulless, evil, insectoid avatar of corruption. With so much in common, the two of you will get along great!</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not so. Bed bugs will cheerfully inhabit perfectly clean places if they get the chance. One thing that keeping the place clean does do, however, is make them much easier to spot. Less cover for the little guys as they rush between the trenches. And bed bugs are easier to deal with if caught early. So while being clean won’t necessarily save you from them, it might save you a visit from an expensive NYC pest control team.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Craigslist is a haven for NYC bed bugs</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for once, nobody is talking about scammers. Bed bugs are notorious hitch-hikers. If you purchase a piece of furniture on Craigslist, and they are lurking within the depths of the poofy pillows, you can bring them into your home. Inspect thoroughly. Look for bugs, but also for eggs and skin shucked off when they molt. While not microscopic, it’s still tough to see, so bring a flashlight.</span> </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Creepers On the subway</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public transportation in New York can be a migration mecca for bed bugs. Taxi’s, shared bicycles, even ticket vending machines. The subway is a particularly popular scene for bed bugs in NYC. With so many people coming and going, it’s easy for them to move from one person to another. Or just hang out in the cushions for someone to sit down. In the past, whole New York</span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bed-bugs-found-on-the-nyc-subway-2014-8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">subway trains have been fumigated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after being overrun with the things. While avoiding the subway during peak hours is ideal, let’s face it, most of us have jobs and can’t afford to do that. So just be aware of where you stand, and it doesn’t hurt to check your clothes after you get home</span>.</p>
