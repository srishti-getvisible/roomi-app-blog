<p>Cost of living in LA for students requires pre-planned budgeting.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-tuition-fees">1. Tuition Fees</h3>



<p>The primary living cost in Los Angeles for students is tuition. Even within LA and its environs, tuition fees differ for different universities. Higher costs are generally associated with factors such as living out of state and attending a private college.</p>



<p>Here are some estimates of yearly LA public and private university&nbsp;tuition fees as of 2021.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>University</th><th>Annual In-state Tuition</th><th>Annual Out-of-state tuition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>USC</td><td>$60,446</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">$60,446</td></tr><tr><td>Biola University</td><td>$44,382</td><td>$44,382</td></tr><tr><td>UCLA</td><td>$13,258</td><td>$43,012</td></tr><tr><td>CSU Northridge</td><td>$7,038</td><td>$18,755</td></tr><tr><td>CSU Long Beach</td><td>$6,834</td><td>$18,857</td></tr><tr><td>LA City College</td><td>$1,220</td><td>$8,110</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>The cost of materials for each academic year is determined by your chosen&nbsp;university, major, and classes.

Keep in mind that a single textbook for a semester can cost well over $200 in some cases.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-transportation-costs">5. Transportation Costs</h3>



<p>In Los Angeles, there are several&nbsp;different modes of transportation you can choose from. A weekly public transport pass costs $25 and allows you access to Metro rail and bus services. Some schools enable students to apply for transportation subsidies &#8211; a&nbsp;viable option&nbsp;if you&#8217;ve decided to live in more affordable&nbsp;accommodation, which is frequently located further away from the campus.</p>

<p>While public transit may limit your flexibility, it&#8217;s an excellent way of escaping the LA gridlock. If you prefer to drive, gas costs $3-5 per gallon, or about $100 per month. Also, remember to bring spare change for street parking, which costs $1-4 per hour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-meals">6. Meals</h3>



<p>Some universities in Los Angeles provide campus meal plans for students &#8211; e.g., USC ($2,860 per semester) and UCLA ($3,810 per semester).</p>



<p>However, arranging your own meals off-campus is more convenient and less expensive. In LA, a fast-food lunch costs $6-8, whereas groceries average $400-500 per month. To enable a hassle-free&nbsp;stay under the living cost in Los Angeles for students, we&#8217;ve broken down the pricing of some of the most typical student food purchases.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t forget to have fun when you&#8217;re living in LA!

The living cost in Los Angeles for students also covers activities that you enjoy, such as going out to the movies or for food with your new friends. A typical movie ticket costs between $10 and $15, however some theaters offer tickets for as little as $6. A meal at a restaurant might cost between $10 to $30.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If transport&nbsp;is a major problem, consider carpooling and dividing petrol costs. The ability to cycle across the city instead of driving or taking public transport is one of the benefits of LA&#8217;s year-round sunshine.</li>



<li>Keep your student ID on you at all times; many restaurants, museums, and other businesses in LA offer student discounts. There are less expensive and healthier alternatives to eating out every night, so plan your meals carefully.</li>



<li>If you&#8217;re bored and searching for something to do, bear in mind that most public libraries also contain movies. Living like a student doesn&#8217;t have to mean missing out on&nbsp;fun, but it does need some preparation and critical thinking!</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pros of Living in Los Angeles</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Outdoor Recreational Activities</h3>



<p>With a plethora of free outdoor activities right on your doorstep, access to an unbelievable amount of events happening everyday, and, of course, landmarks/museums/monuments to visit, it&#8217;s virtually impossible to become bored when living in Los Angeles. There&#8217;s always something entertaining going on, whatever you&#8217;re into.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pleasant Weather</h3>



<p>Los Angeles is renowned for its pleasant weather all year. In fact, the city receives almost 300 days of sunshine each year, so it&#8217;s easy for Angelenos to enjoy the benefits of city living with outdoor fun. Beautiful beaches, parks, a variety of hiking routes, outdoor entertainment, alfresco dining, and much more are all available.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Supportive City For Artists &amp; Dreamers</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re relocating to Los Angeles, you&#8217;ll be moving to a city brimming with artists, visionaries, and doers. All of whom contribute to the never-ending world-class entertainment options available to you every day of the week!</p>



<p>Many people living in LA pursue jobs beyond the 9-to-5, such as acting, writing, and other creative endeavors. If you&#8217;re having second thoughts about your office job and want to do something on the side, LA is a wonderful place to start because you&#8217;ll have access to a new realm of possibilities, contacts, and like-minded people.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Balanced Lifestyle</h3>



<p>LA has real respect for leisure, despite being a large and bustling city that can be rather stressful at times. From the clothes, down to the &#8220;you do you&#8221; mentality, everything appears to be more casual in LA. People in suits, and those with traditional 9-5 occupations, are not so common. This city, for the most part, promotes a healthy work-life balance, which can be quite uplifting.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Progressive &amp; Diverse Culture</h3>



<p>Los Angeles is widely appreciated for being a &#8220;melting pot&#8221; of several cultures, each of which is welcomed as a member of the broader LA community. Design, art, music, food, and so much more are all covered. You won&#8217;t have to travel far to see new locations, meet new people, and have amazing adventures.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cons of Living in Los Angeles</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Parking</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s never easy to get a parking spot in Los Angeles. If it isn&#8217;t a general shortage of parking, it is the cost, the location, the valet, the waiting, the &#8211; you get the picture. You could be in for a costly and stressful encounter. If you&#8217;re unlucky enough to misinterpret a parking notice or fail to fill the meter, you&#8217;re in for a big parking charge.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Highly&nbsp;Competitive Job Market</h3>



<p>Despite the fact that the Los Angeles job market is prospering in comparison to the rest of California and the US, finding the perfect opportunity might be tough if you don&#8217;t know where to look. Many residents of this city connect their lives with tourism and entertainment, yet it&#8217;s also the country&#8217;s largest urban manufacturing center.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re moving to LA, there are jobs available in steel, automobiles, clothes, and electronics industries. Further, employment in technology is also in high demand. There are also a number of roles in the public sector, whether you want to be a cop, a fireman, or a paramedic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. High Cost of Living</h3>



<p>Be prepared to live a pricey lifestyle, if you&#8217;re moving to LA! Housing costs are high in all attractive areas and have only continued to climb till now. The cost of living in Los Angeles is 43% more than the national average (more than 50% in some neighborhoods). To rent an apartment in Los Angeles, you&#8217;ll need more than the annual median salary, for real! However, living in LA is still cheaper than living in NYC or SF. But only by a little margin.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public Transportation &amp; Traffic</h3>



<p>One of the benefits of living in a city is that you may save money on gas and car upkeep by taking public transportation. This is a luxury that you won&#8217;t find living in Los Angeles. While the transportation system has improved over time, it&#8217;s still far from perfect.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Because the city is rather spread out, unless you live close to your workplace, you&#8217;ll inevitably have to commute during the day. This involves traveling down the notorious LA roads, which are constantly clogged to the brim.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Moving to LA for you?</h2>



<p>The pros and cons of living in Los Angeles largely come down to your own priorities. Everyone wants something different, and you can make what you want out of it.</p>



<p>But keep in mind that while LA is another large, stunning metropolis, it&#8217;s nothing compared to New York, Chicago, DC, or even Paris, London, and Tokyo. That being said, the pros and cons of living in Los Angeles do not undermine LA&#8217;s unique approach to &#8220;big city life&#8221;.</p>

<p>Los Angeles &#8211; the city of dreams, baby! If you have wondered if moving to Los Angeles is for you, you are not alone. Common questions to often pop up are- is the cost of living in Los Angeles something I can truly afford? Is LA a good place to live, especially if you&#8217;ve never been to California? Most importantly, is living in LA worth it for YOU?</p>



<p>One thing you should know before anything else, is that LA is huge! As you walk yourself through this guide, remember the long distances.(that you can cruise through endless sunsets in)</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a place for everyone in LA, and the city is fueled by more than just overpriced gas.</p>



<p>Los Angeles County is made up of 88 cities. Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, and Santa Monica comprise what we colloquially refer to as LA.</p>

<p>Another thing to remember is that Los Angeles is filled with extremes. You can find snowcapped mountains reaching 10,000 feet in the sky as well as the infamous 100-degree heat of the Valley, glaring views of the mansions as well as the tents, the sunshine, and the floods. This should also contextualize why it&#8217;s so easy to misunderstand LA.</p>



<p><strong>Before moving to Los Angeles, the best way to get to know the city is by spending some time here. However, there are some must-knows while you do your research!</strong> <strong>Let&#8217;s take a ride through the questions that will help you figure out if living in LA is worth it!</strong></p>

<p>Moving to Los Angeles comes with a wonderful set of surprises. You will find hundreds of neighborhoods here. Sometimes, these neighborhoods have boundaries that are often disputed, and walking just a few blocks may lead you to discover two completely different communities.</p>



<p>So what makes the overall character of the city so alive? Well, it gets its &#8216;La La Land&#8217; nickname for its laidback attitude, so when in LA do as the Angelenos do. There are tightly knit communities like Leimert Park that are well contrasted by the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2014-jan-19-la-fi-commre-downtown-20140119-story.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">contemporary of South Park</a> in Downtown LA. <a href="https://www.visitcalifornia.com/in/attraction/north-hollywood" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">North Hollywood</a> in the San Fernando Valley is a little calmer and slower in pace in comparison to the rest of LA. San Pedro&#8217;s small-town vibe <em>will</em> remind you of the Midwest, and remains the <a href="https://www.neighborhoods.com/blog/what-its-like-living-in-san-pedro-los-angeles#:~:text=San%20Pedro%20is%20likely%20LA's,Pedro%20are%20a%20great%20deal.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;last affordable beach town&#8221;</a>.</p>



<p>So we reiterate: there&#8217;s something for everyone here.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re convinced you&#8217;re moving to Los Angeles, we recommend crashing at a friend&#8217;s house for a few weeks before you book a couple of trucks, sign a lease, or buy a house and start moving in. Give yourself the time to learn about the many types of neighborhoods in LA.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s where you want to be on top of things like your desired neighborhood&#8217;s price in relation to your budget, and the walkability score of the place you choose to move to.</p>

<p>Yes, at first glance it can feel like the city is built for cars. You will also see many single-family homes, lots of garages, and unnecessarily huge parking spaces. But, to the traffic hater&#8217;s joy, the city boasts to have the U.S.&#8217;s largest public transport system. But that&#8217;s not all. The city of Los Angeles is also planning on making its infrastructure more biker friendly, as well as walker-friendly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But, here&#8217;s the catch&#8230;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="5446" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/things-to-consider-before-moving-to-los-angeles-roomi/attachment/untitled-3/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Untitled-3.png?fit=1050%2C700&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1050,700" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Untitled-3" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Untitled-3.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Untitled-3.png?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Untitled-3.png?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Snapshot of LA" class="wp-image-5446" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Untitled-3.png?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Untitled-3.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Untitled-3.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Untitled-3.png?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>But, here&#8217;s the catch&#8230;</figcaption></figure>



<p>So is LA a good place to live for everyone? There are a few caveats to consider. This is the city of opportunity. And a city like that comes with major job prospects.</p>



<p>Unlike most industry-driven cities in the world, LA does not have a single specific business district. Instead, LA has several nuclei that are scattered around the city. It becomes one of the biggest reasons behind LA&#8217;s traffic problem. </p>



<p>The sheer distance you might have to cover to get from work to home and back might just become a huge stress-factor. Therefore, if you choose to come here, think of the cost of living in Los Angeles and if you can afford all that driving around.</p>



<p>So you need to ask yourself if you&#8217;re ready to take on the train or bus commute day-in, day-out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The weather is everything</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s always sunny in Los Angeles. Well, almost always. On average, there are <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bestplaces.net/climate/city/california/los_angeles#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20there%20are%20284,average%2C%2034%20days%20per%20year.)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">284 sunny days per year</a> here. Just to add, the clear-as-day skies are what made the movie industry grow to what we see today. </p>



<p> According to the National Weather Service, daytime temperatures have averaged a perfect 75 degrees for the past 30 years. No need to wonder is LA a good place to live when the sun is by your side 24/7.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You&#8217;ll experience the best highs and the worst lows</h2>

<p>There will be days when you begrudgingly cover 5 miles in 45 minutes but end up catching a pink &amp; gold sunset over Santa Monica Bay. You might also see a saddening amount of homeless encampments on your way to work, spend $7 on a coffee (another part of the high cost of living in Los Angeles!). Maybe even wake up amid a 110-degree day in October. </p>



<p>However, the next day you will wake up to clear skies, a soothing breeze, and birds chirping outside your window. Imagine driving home during the golden hour and through a colonnade of palm trees.</p>



<p>Be prepared to fall in and out of love with LA on the same day. (and living in LA is worth it, despite it all)</p>

<p>This one fully depends on where you&#8217;re moving to Los Angeles from. The cost of housing, gas, groceries, and going out may shock you, as they&#8217;re fairly expensive compared to the rest of the U.S. In this <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/economy/cost-to-live-comfortably-biggest-cities-us/#1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">survey</a> conducted in 2017, the income and individual needs to live comfortably in Urban L.A. are $76,047 &#8211; this survey also factors in things like discretionary expenses and savings. However, most people can certainly get by just fine with less. The <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/losangelescountycalifornia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">median household income in L.A</a>. is $68,004.
