<p>The Holiday season is finally here, and it&#8217;s time for all to cheer! Thanksgiving has just gone by and Christmas Day is right around the corner. When we think about Christmas, we think about all the things we&#8217;re allowed to do, that we normally wouldn&#8217;t. Chocolate for breakfast, anyone?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re anything like us, you enjoy the morning spent feasting and sharing gifts.

There are lots of things to do on Christmas day that truly capture the essence of the holiday season. We&#8217;ve curated a list, just for you, of all the jolly things you can do on the happiest day of the year!</p>

<p>Of all the things to do on Christmas Day, this one surely has to be the yummiest! Fruit cake and sugar cookies are a Christmas staple. And we can&#8217;t forget gingerbread houses! What&#8217;s a better way to indulge in these delicacies than to bake your own?</p>



<p>An old Christmas custom was to fast for multiple days leading up to the big holiday and finally eat to your heart&#8217;s content on Christmas eve. While many of us may not fast anymore, we can surely feast! Baking with your family or roommates is a great way to bond with them, as well as come up with some delectable goodies to share and devour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-binge-christmas-movies">2. Binge Christmas Movies</h3>

<p>Movies dedicated to the biggest holiday of the year are an entire genre in themselves. Something about these movies really ends up making us all feel giddy, and we can&#8217;t get enough of them! Every year, a number of new Christmas movies are released, and despite a lot of them having similar plots, we love to binge them.</p>



<p>So get out your TV guides (if that&#8217;s a thing anymore) and mix up your movie playlists with the newbies and the classics!</p>

<p>The true essence of Christmas lies in giving. Whether it&#8217;s giving back to the community or giving to the less privileged, this is what true joy feels like. One of the best, and most giving things you can do on Christmas Day is to volunteer!</p>



<p>There are so many places that need an extra pair of hands-on Christmas Day, such as soup kitchens, children&#8217;s shelters, and old age homes. Many of the people here usually spend Christmas alone and, in a time of togetherness, you can be the company they&#8217;re wishing for.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-donate">4. Donate!</h3>



<p>Declutter your home and get rid of whatever you don&#8217;t need. Whether it&#8217;s clothes or toys, donate whatever you can to shelters and orphanages. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s something old to you, because it&#8217;s definitely new to the ones receiving it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s especially important to donate during a pandemic when a lot of families have lost their sources of income. Many of these people can&#8217;t even imagine celebrating Christmas at such a time, so you can bring a little joy into their lives.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s Christmas without some dancing? Just like the movies, Christmas music, too, is a genre all by itself. Almost every musician has made their own Christmas song at some point, whether they&#8217;ve covered the classics or performed originals. Take your pick and get Jingle Bell Rock-in&#8217;!</p>

<p>Malls, during the holiday season, look like a complete Winter Wonderland! And, of all the things to do on Christmas Day, this one could probably be the most expensive (but fun!).</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve got some spare time on Christmas, you should definitely visit the mall and just take in the magic. Maybe even get a picture taken with Santa &#8211; why should kids have all the fun? Get yourself a gift or two, because when else would you splurge on yourself, if not on Christmas?</p>

<p>We&#8217;re not talking about your family greeting cards. It&#8217;s time to don those cute-yet-ugly Christmas sweaters and get clicking! If your family lives apart and Christmas is one of the few times you get together, this is the best way to capture some great memories.</p>



<p>Get some funky accessories to match your outfits and go wild!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-go-caroling">8. Go Caroling</h3>

<p>Even the biggest Grinch can&#8217;t help but hum along to classic Christmas carols. Caroling is a fun activity for the whole group to do together, and the perfect display of the spirit of togetherness! It may be one of the most cliché things to do on Christmas Day, but the day really feels incomplete without some carols!</p>

<p>Every year, we put a lot of effort into decorating our houses for Christmas. When a street looks straight out of a Home Alone movie, it gives us a warm, fuzzy feeling. One of our favorite things to do on Christmas Day is to drive around and admire the sparkling homes.</p>

<p>The bottom line is, though, is that you don&#8217;t really need to have a lot of things to do on Christmas Day, to enjoy being together. Just sitting, talking, laughing, and playing games is enough on a day like today.</p>



<p>Christmas is one of the few times in a year when the whole family or all of your friends are truly together. We don&#8217;t need to do something extraordinary to show our loved ones that we love them, because they already know it.</p>

<p>This Christmas, make sure to take some time out to just be in the moment, with your loved ones, and be grateful for all that you have. Happy holidays! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2603.png" alt="☃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Thanksgiving is over, which means the Christmas season is finally here! Even though it’s still November, It’s never too early to start getting into the Christmas spirit &#8211; even if COVID-19 is making the holiday look a little different this year. This Thanksgiving, many families had to spend the holiday apart from one another to keep each other safe. Since Christmas is less than a month away, spending the holiday season away from family will most likely be the safest option. Even though it’s upsetting not to be with family, you’ll get to spend a lot more quality time bonding with your roommate. You might even be exchanging cool and fun Christmas traditions together. </p>



<p>Since spending the holiday season with roommates is a possibility, it’s important that you still make the season as fun and festive as you can. In order to start off the Christmas season right, try creating new and fun holiday traditions with your roommate! Here are a few ideas to help you and your roomi celebrate the holiday season together.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Build gingerbread houses to bond with roommates</h2>



<p>One of the most classic Christmas traditions! Making gingerbread houses is both fun and budget-friendly. Pick up a gingerbread-making kit at your local grocery store or order one online. Make an event out of your gingerbread house session by pouring yourself a cup of hot cocoa and watching a classic Christmas movie while you create your masterpiece!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Decorate the tree</h2>



<p>Decorating a tree is the best roommate bonding exercise there is! A Christmas tree is an essential part of Christmas traditions. Depending on where you live and what your budget looks like, buying an artificial tree might be a smart option instead of purchasing a live tree. Decide with your roomi whether a real or artificial tree will be the best option for you.</p>



<p>Once you’ve gotten your tree, browse stores such as Target or Michaels for cheap string lights to hang on your tree. Michaels is a great store to look at if you’re in need of affordable tree ornaments too. Choose a day together and spend it decorating your tree while listening to some festive Christmas tunes!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fun Christmas tradition: Hang stockings together</h2>



<p>Hanging stockings is a staple during the holidays. Get into the Christmas spirit and look for matching stockings for you and your roommate. Browse Amazon or Target &#8211; there’s no need to break the bank when buying stockings!</p>



<p>If you’re an arts and crafts lover, grab some markers and glitter glue, and personalize your stocking by decorating it. When you’re done, pick a spot for you and your roommate to hang your stockings. Be sure to buy stocking stuffers to fill up your roommate’s stocking on Christmas morning!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Have a holiday movie marathon</h2>



<p>Get into the holiday mood with a Christmas movie marathon! Pick a week and choose a different Christmas movie to watch each day. There are tons of options to browse on Netflix such as The Grinch and and The Christmas Chronicles. Grab some popcorn and eggnog and enjoy!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bake Christmas cookies</h2>



<p>Calling all bakers! Another great way to get into the holiday spirit and celebrate the quintessential Christmas traditions. Not only are they delicious, but baking with your roomi is a great roommate bonding exercise. It will not help you to beat the holiday blues but also support each other through these challenging times.</p>



<p>Choose what you want to bake, such as sugar cookies or gingerbread, and make the dessert from scratch. Baking homemade creations is much more satisfying than cooking from a box, and you get instant Instagram bragging rights!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Swap presents</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t forget to buy your roomi a Christmas gift! Decide on the perfect gift for your roomi and do your holiday shopping early so you aren&#8217;t rushed. Can&#8217;t decide on the perfect Christmas gift for your roomi? Reach out to a family member or friend for some holiday gift-giving inspo!</p>
