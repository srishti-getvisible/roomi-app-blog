<p>It&#8217;s the end of the month, and you have one week to get your next paycheck. If eating healthy, preparing easy meals, and sticking to a budget is on your mind, then your finger tapping has brought you to the right article. Here are our top easy healthy meals on a budget for you. There&#8217;s something for everyone &#8211; vegan dishes included!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-easy-healthy-meal-1-vegan-pancakes">Easy Healthy Meal #1 &#8211; Vegan Pancakes</h2>



<p>Imagine soft, thick fluffy pancakes that you can enjoy for breakfast or even for dessert. If easy healthy meals on a budget is on your mind &#8211; then this is something you must try. Made with super basic ingredients and a meal that can be enjoyed as a breakfast or dinner. Let&#8217;s get straight to it, shall we?</p>



<p>For this, you will need:</p>



<p>1 Cup flour (roughly 125g)</p>



<p>1 tbsp. baking powder (for that sweet rise)</p>



<p>2 tbsp. sugar (depending on how sweet you like it)</p>



<p>1/2 tbsp. salt (love how this balances the flavor)</p>



<p>1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar (don&#8217;t worry &#8211; your pancakes are safe!)</p>



<p>1 tbsp. Vanilla essence (can&#8217;t imagine a world without vanilla essence)</p>



<p>1 cup non-dairy milk (in this recipe, we will be using almond milk but, you can use oat/coconut/cashew milk)</p>



<p>Time to whisk, pour, flip and devour!</p>



<p>Take a medium bowl &#8211; add the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt, and stir to combine. In a separate bowl, add all the wet ingredients, and stir to mix them evenly. Pour the liquid mixture into the dry mixture and whisk to make a smooth batter. Let this sit for 5 minutes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, heat a pan and keep it on medium flame, pour roughly half a cup of the pancake mix and flip it over when it starts to bubble. Cook until golden. <em>Voila</em>!</p>



<p>Enjoy your stack with Nutella, jam or honey.</p>



<p>Pro tip &#8211; Save/freeze the remaining batter to use later!</p>



<p>Next up on our easy healthy meals on a budget is our personal fave:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-easy-healthy-meal-2-herby-chicken-breast-with-veggies">Easy Healthy Meal #2 &#8211; Herby chicken breast with veggies</h2>



<p>This perfect dinner recipe is a beautiful marriage between juicy chicken breast and healthy veggies. It&#8217;s so simple yet so flavorful &#8211; you&#8217;ll be cooking it all year long.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s get started by finding these in your kitchen:</p>



<p>1 medium-sized red potato (chop big rough pieces)</p>



<p>2 medium carrots</p>



<p>2 celery stalks</p>



<p>1 medium red onion</p>



<p>2 tbsp. olive oil</p>



<p>Salt &amp; Pepper</p>



<p>3 chicken breasts</p>



<p>1 lemon halved</p>



<p>1/4 cup chopped parsley</p>



<p>Optional: Seasoning and dried/fresh herbs</p>



<p>Meanwhile stomach: I will now demonstrate a whale&#8217;s mating call.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s not keep those whales wailing &#8211; begin by preheating the oven to 450 degrees F. Roughly chop your veggies &#8211; big chunky pieces work best. Toss these veggies in olive oil, salt and pepper, and arrange them on a baking sheet in a single layer. Pop the baking tray into the oven on the top-most section. Roast until the vegetables become slightly brown and the potatoes begin to soften.</p>



<p>Grab the breasts. Not yours, silly! The chicken breasts &#8211; prep them by rubbing some olive oil, salt, and dried herbs such as rosemary, oregano, black pepper, or chilli flakes. Carefully place the chicken breast on top of the veggies and let it cook for 20-25 mins until the skin turns golden brown. If the juice runs clear when pierced, your chicken is good and ready! Bring out the veggies, toss them in lemon juice and serve alongside your delicious chicken.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi Tip</strong> &#8211; Save the leftovers for a yummy steamy soup, or deep freeze it for a stir fry later.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-freezing-food-kill-coronavirus">Does freezing food kill coronavirus?</h2>



<p>We hate to be the bearer of bad news but deep freezing food DOESN&#8217;T kill the coronavirus, at least <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://instituteforfoodsafety.cornell.edu/coronavirus-covid-19/food-industry-resources/food-industry-faqs/" target="_blank">that&#8217;s what the FDA says</a>.</p>



<p>Currently, there&#8217;s not much research on this matter to support this hypothesis &#8211; though we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve heard the rumors, too! The best practice to follow is to wash your hands with soap and water before preparing or eating food. Wash your hands diligently, and always take precautions when stepping out.
