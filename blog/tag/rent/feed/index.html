<p>If you’re on the hunt for a new home, you’re likely looking for the most affordable apartments for rent in Washington D.C., right? Rent control is a pretty nice setup in some of America’s major metros. And Washington D.C. renters are among the&nbsp;lucky ones who can benefit from it.</p>



<p>A lot of the usual rent control laws apply in Washington D.C. as they do in cities like San Francisco&nbsp;and New York City. Whether you’re a new or veteran renter, here’s what you should know. Plus, some tips and a free online tool for finding rent-controlled apartments in Washington D.C.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-rent-control">What is Rent Control?</h2>



<p>Rent control is a legal system administered by the government to limit the amount that landlords can charge for in rent and lease. This also limits how much landlords can raise rent for tenants.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-state-rent-in-washington-d-c">The state rent in Washington D.C.</h3>



<p>Finding apartments for rent in Washington D.C. isn’t complicated, as long as budget isn&#8217;t a factor. With a $1,500 budget, one can find an empty rental unit and the price increases the more amenities you need.</p>



<p>And while that might sound frustratingly similar to a lot of major rental markets plagued with high rent prices, the City has been doing its part to make affordable housing more available. Introducing rent control was one of the first steps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rent-control-in-washington-d-c">Rent Control in Washington D.C.</h2>



<p>Rent control is a hot-button issue in cities across the United States, and Washington D.C. is no exception. With skyrocketing housing costs and a dwindling supply of affordable units, many residents are finding it difficult to keep up with the rising rents.</p>

<p>Rent-controlled apartments in Washington D.C. provide a glimmer of hope for those struggling to find affordable housing. But what does it entail?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What buildings qualify for rent control?</h3>



<p>A&nbsp;majority&nbsp;of rental units in D.C. fall under rent control, yet a surprising number of residents aren&#8217;t aware of how pervasive rent control laws are. All rental complexes with four or more units fall under rent control, thanks to this law, with a few notable exceptions. A dwelling is exempt from rent control if:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>It was built after 1975.</li>



<li>The unit has been continuously vacant since January 1, 1985.</li>



<li>The dwelling is owned by a person not owning more than four rentals.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s subsidized by the Government or the District.</li>



<li>The building is under an improvement plan receiving rehabilitation assistance through the Department of Housing and Community Development.</li>
</ol>



<p>Another exemption is if a rental unit isn&#8217;t registered with the Rental Accommocations Division (RAD), it&#8217;s automatically under rent control even if it counts under these exemptions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How much rent in Washington D.C. increases yearly?</h3>



<p>Basically, if you find apartments for rent in Washington D.C. and they’re in buildings with more than four rental units, and they aren’t new, they’re very likely rent-controlled.</p>



<p>All rent increases are based on a yearly adjusted Consumer Price Index (CPI-W), which factors in workers’ wages. This allows the population to keep up with inflation. Meaning, all rent-controlled units increase in rent each year. But by marginally less&nbsp;than newer rentals and other non-rent-controlled units. Landlords can’t increase rent more than 10 percent each year.</p>



<p>But for most tenants, the average yearly increase is the CPI plus another 2 percent. For disabled or elderly tenants, it’s even lower, with a maximum increase of 5 percent per 12 months.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exceptions to the&nbsp;rule</h3>



<p>In the case that a unit becomes vacant, the landlord can raise the rent&nbsp;price more than once in the same year. The “vacancy increase” rule allows the landlord to:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Increase rent by 10 percent more than was charged to the former tenant; Or,</li>



<li>Rent it for the price of a comparable rental unit, but the rent hike can’t be more than 30 percent.</li>
</ol>



<p>There’s also a clause in the Rental Housing Act of 1985 that allows landlords/property owners to claim hardship. Essentially, if they find themselves unable to make a 12 percent rate of return on the property (with 12-15 months of paper proof of the fact), they can raise the rent to make that 12 percent.</p>



<p>Additionally, a property owner can petition to raise the rent to make improvements to the building required by local law. That being said, tenants should stay in the know about whether their landlord is following the legal processes to raise rent. And if you live in a home that falls under rent control&nbsp;but hasn&#8217;t been registered, you should file a complaint.</p>

<p>All you have to do is input the location or area you&#8217;re planning to move in to and Roomi will show you a list of affordable apartments available for rent. You can then filter your search by duration (flexible, fixed, and 12 months), layout, type of property, number of bedrooms, and popular amenities. Aside from these, there are options to show only ID-verified listings and to input an age range, preferred gender, and the amount of monthly rent.</p>



<p>Roomi also protects its users with its background checks, ID verification, and in-app messaging features.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. With the Section 8 voucher program</h3>



<p>When finding rent-controlled apartments in Washington D.C., the issues lie in vacancy rates pricing, and availability in general. If you’re moving to D.C. with little in the bank, you might apply for&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/find-section-eight-housing/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Section 8</a>, a voucher program for low-income, elderly, or disabled renters.</p>



<p>Due to the increase of rents in the city, with the Section 8 voucher, you&#8217;ll most likely have better luck with smaller units. It&#8217;s less common to find more than a three-bedroom section 8 house in Washington, D.C..</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Scoping out the rent-controlled buildings</h3>



<p>If you don’t qualify for Section 8, there are still plenty of techniques to finding affordable apartments in D.C. The first step is to do some research before you hit the streets looking. Use D.C.’s affordable housing locator, and see what comes up. Research the neighborhoods, and use a realtor to help with the legwork.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a tip: Always&nbsp;ask your landlord&nbsp;about the details of the place you want to rent. Because the landlord will have to disclose that information, legally speaking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Washington D.C. and Its Rent-Controlled Apartments: The Verdict</h2>



<p>With low vacancy rates, it may be difficult to secure a rent-controlled apartment from scratch. But you&nbsp;can&nbsp;run into some luck by finding a housemate who already did the dirty work of locking one down and has an open room to fill. Even if it doesn’t have every amenity on your list, locking down an affordable apartment offers you a lot to gain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The world is opening up and the real estate market is bouncing back to its pre-pandemic ways. Life in the Big Apple is not cheap. Now with the implementation of a new rule, it might seem impossible to rent an apartment in the city. If you&#8217;re moving to NYC, or are already a seasoned renter, let&#8217;s explore what the 40x rent rule means, and how you can get around it. In this guide, we&#8217;ll answer your burning questions about the requirements to rent an apartment in NYC. <strong>There&#8217;s still hope! We&#8217;ve made a list of the 6 ways you can lock down an apartment even if you don&#8217;t meet the criteria of the 40x rent rule in NYC.</strong> Let&#8217;s dive in!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-40x-rent-rule-in-nyc">What is the 40x Rent Rule in NYC?</h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/realestate/so-your-rent-is-about-to-spike-can-you-avoid-paying-more.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">NY Times</a>, the median rent in Manhattan has bounced back to just above $3,000. This means New Yorkers should make more than $120,000 per year to afford this price. This figure is 40 times the median monthly rent. Additionally, you and your roommates (if you have them), must maintain good credit to secure the apartment of your dreams.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-s-the-problem-with-40-times-rent">What&#8217;s the Problem with 40 Times Rent?</h3>



<p>New Yorkers simply don&#8217;t make as much money as they need to be approved to rent certain homes. Let&#8217;s take a quick look at the statistics related to the 40x rent rule in NYC:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> suggests that an average, full-time employee earns approximately $51,480 per year.</li><li>This means that their monthly income is about $4,200 per month.</li><li>So, if $3,000 goes towards the monthly rent payments, New Yorkers only have a a little over $1,000 left. This amount doesn&#8217;t account for utilities and personal expenses, pet care, among others.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-ways-to-get-around-the-40x-rule-rent-in-nyc">6 Ways to Get Around the 40x Rule Rent in NYC</h2>



<p>Did you know that New York City&#8217;s housing expenses are <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Location=New-York-NY/Salary" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">369% higher</a> than the national average? <strong>So, how can you rent an apartment if you don&#8217;t meet the rule of 40 times rent?</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-tis-the-season-for-moving-to-nyc">1. &#8216;Tis the Season for Moving to NYC</h3>



<p>Are you thinking of moving to NYC? Traditionally, winter is a slow time for rentals. The city experiences a high volume of apartment shoppers in the summers, for example, international students living off-campus.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Therefore, in the winters, landlords might be more open to renting to you if you are just below the income threshold.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>TIP:</strong> This is the perfect time to move to NYC while everyone else gets busy with Christmas shopping!</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-look-for-roommate-s">2. Look for Roommate(s)</h3>



<p>The more people there are on your apartment lease, the lesser you&#8217;ll pay in monthly rent payments individually. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean that you should rent a 1-bedroom apartment and have ten roommates.</p>



<p>Depending on the layout of apartments, three or four tenants might consider renting a two-bedroom to split the high rent. In the case where two out of the four renters have good financials, they could be leaseholders. Then, a roommate agreement can be drawn up amongst the tenants explicitly stating who is responsible for what expense.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-tighten-up-your-credit-score">3. Tighten Up your Credit Score</h3>



<p>Landlords have different criteria when it comes to credit scores. Most are looking for a number around 700. However, they might be willing to look beyond the score if the apartments need to be filled.</p>



<p><strong>How to improve your credit to get around the 40x rent rule in NYC:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The most obvious way to improve your credit score is by paying existing debts. This is especially important for renters who have exceeded 15%-30% of their available credit.</li><li>If you have errors on your credit report, make sure they are corrected. Furthermore, you might want to consider getting letters of explanation for any major issues like bankruptcy.</li><li>Finally, If you don’t have a credit history, open some credit cards and start making regular, on-time payments.</li></ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-search-for-an-accommodating-landlord">4. Search for an Accommodating Landlord</h3>



<p>Searching for a flexible landlord is incredibly important if you don&#8217;t meet the requirements of the 40x rent rule in NYC. You might be able to negotiate with small landlords or condo owners because they aren&#8217;t large real-estate corporations. You can often negotiate rental terms and conditions with smaller landlords one-on-one. Not only that, but they might even be able to provide a co-signer if necessary!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>TIP:</strong> Search on real estate listing sites for homes that accept guarantors and those owned by individual owners.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-the-affordable-housing-lottery">5. The Affordable Housing Lottery</h3>



<p>The city provides affordable housing for low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled. Are you willing to play a long game here?

Once the application process is completed, it can take years to secure a spot in the system.

Rent negotiation might be scary concept, but it can save you stress (and money) in the long run. In this guide, we&#8217;ve set out 8 handy tips for how to negotiate a rent decrease.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-negotiate-rent-as-a-new-tenant">How to Negotiate Rent as a New Tenant</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re a new tenant, you&#8217;ll need to think about both sides during your negotiation. Contrary to popular belief, negotiating isn&#8217;t always about winning. The other person has to feel like they&#8217;re getting something out of it, too. Think of things your landlord would value in exchange for reducing your rent.</p>



<p>You should consider these ideas when trying to negotiate rent:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Committing to a longer lease is a strong negotiating factor. This works best if you can see yourself staying in that apartment for a while. For example, if the current lease is for a year, you can offer to sign a two-year lease in exchange for a reduced rent. Landlords may appreciate this as looking for new tenants is a time consuming process for them.</li><li>If you can offer to pay your rent a few months in advance, rent reduction negotiations may end in your favor.</li><li>You can also offer to end your lease during summertime, which is a peak renting period. During the summer, a lot of people tend to search for new apartments. So, offering to end the lease during this period may make your landlord more amenable.</li><li>Find terms in the lease you can use to your advantage. For instance, let&#8217;s say you don&#8217;t own a pet, but your rental allows them. For landlords, cleaning an apartment previously owned by a pet-owning resident costs more time and money. Mention that you don&#8217;t own a pet, so the landlord doesn&#8217;t have to spend as much on cleaning after you move out.</li></ul>



<p>You can brainstorm other ideas you feel are suitable, just make sure your landlord is also getting something of value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-negotiate-rent-as-an-existing-tenant">How to Negotiate Rent as an Existing Tenant</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re a current tenant and your landlord decides to make changes to your rent, then how do you go about it negotiating a rent decrease? Here are 8 tips on how to negotiate rent as an existing tenant:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-1-do-your-research">Tip #1: Do your research</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to research similar properties in your neighborhood. This will help you compare rent prices before you begin negotiations. If the prices are more or less the same, then it may be a bit harder for you to negotiate. However, if you notice that less rent is paid by other tenants, you can use that information to support your case.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-2-write-a-great-negotiation-request-letter-but-negotiate-in-person">Tip #2: Write a great negotiation request letter, but negotiate in person</h2>



<p>Sending your landlord a well-written letter about negotiating a lower rent could help your cause. The letter may not do the trick on its own, but a direct appeal might make reaching your goal easier. In your letter, be sure to point out that you&#8217;re open to more discussions, which you&#8217;d be happy to attend in person. This is because it&#8217;s tougher to say no to someone face to face, rather than over the phone.</p>



<p>The letter should be persuasive, but above all, honest, as it may affect your landlord&#8217;s decision.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-3-do-it-at-the-right-time">Tip #3: Do it at the right time</h2>



<p>Timing is everything. If you try to negotiate rent at the wrong time, you may not be successful in negotiating a rent decrease. Be sure to begin negotiations some months before your current lease expires, so that your landlord will not sense that you&#8217;re in a hurry. It&#8217;s also advisable to negotiate during slower seasons of the year, like winter. Trying to strike a deal during summer, when there&#8217;s high demand, may not work out so well for you.</p>



<p>Equally, you want to negotiate rent when you know you can stay on longer. Landlords may be more willing to negotiate if they know they won&#8217;t have to look for another tenant for a while.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-4-be-well-prepared">Tip #4: Be well prepared</h2>



<p>You won&#8217;t get what you&#8217;re after without a solid game plan. Make sure you have a precise strategy and know exactly what you hope to achieve. This is one of the best ways to negotiate rent. A good way to be prepared is by having important documents on hand to help you build your case. You can bring up your previous rent payment record and your credit score. References from previous landlords will also help you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-5-show-the-landlord-that-you-mean-business">Tip #5: Show the landlord that you mean business</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:100%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/q9lXWZcBX3Te0qCI1x" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/PBSSoCal-pbs-socal-actors-on-variety-studio-q9lXWZcBX3Te0qCI1x"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Paying rent in advance is a strong motivator for the right landlord. It will show that you&#8217;re serious, especially if you plan on signing a long-term lease. However, paying rent in advance depends on where you live, as some state laws don&#8217;t allow this.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-6-focus-on-small-negotiations">Tip #6: Focus on small negotiations</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t start negotiations by asking for too much off your rent upfront. Try to bargain for smaller reductions that won&#8217;t scare the landlord away.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-7-mentioning-your-good-track-record">Tip #7: Mentioning your good track record</h2>



<p>If you know you&#8217;ve been a good tenant, you can point that out. Include how well you pass your apartment searches and how you always pay rent on time/early. You can also point out that you haven&#8217;t violated any lease terms. No landlord wants to deal with a bad tenant, so mentioning all your good qualities may help seal the deal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-8-consider-the-counteroffer-possibilities-and-know-when-to-let-go">Tip #8: Consider the counteroffer possibilities and know when to let go</h2>



<p>Very rarely will the person you&#8217;re negotiating with agree to your first offer. Be prepared for counteroffers when trying to negotiate a rent decrease.</p>



<p>If you find a counteroffer that you&#8217;re good with, then you can go ahead and close the deal. However, if you can&#8217;t agree with the price your landlord is offering, then walk away.</p>



<p>We hope this list has been helpful in explaining how to negotiate rent with your landlord. Our advice is not to fret. Start by doing your research, write a rent negotiation letter, then utilize these tips during the negotiations process. The most important thing is to be prepared all the way through. Best of luck to you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Think you&#8217;ve found the right apartment? Congratulations! We know the hunt can be tough, and we bet you&#8217;re ready to settle into your new place now. At this point, you&#8217;ll need to sign a lease agreement with the property manager or landlord. Among other things, this should cover your rent payment plan. While you might never need to use this, it can offer peace of mind in case any financial difficulties pop up in the future.</p>



<p>The rent payment plan kicks into action if you default on your rent payments, or are unable to make payments temporarily. If you don&#8217;t have one, and it happens that you can&#8217;t pay rent for any reason, you need to talk to your landlord or property manager about a rent arrears repayment plan. Failing to do this could lead to eviction.</p>



<p>However, having a conversation with your landlord or property manager about a rent repayment plan ensures you&#8217;ll still have a roof over your head while you get your finances back on track.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-a-rent-payment-plan">What is a rent payment plan?</h2>



<p>A rent payment plan is a kind of payment pledge in which the tenant commits to make a series of rent or debt payments. This comes into play if you owe money on your rent. Payment plans allow tenants a chance to avoid legal action by consenting to pay a portion of past-due rent each month until the payment is complete. Best of all? Tenants get to stay in their apartment and landlords know they&#8217;ll get up-to-date on what they owe.</p>

<p>We absolutely recommend having a rent arrears repayment plan in place, to protect against overdue rent payments you can&#8217;t afford. A rent payment plan allows you to pay back your rent in installments until you can clear the backlog. This varies from one landlord and property manager to another.</p>



<p>However that works out for you, it means you get to stay in your apartment for longer. The good news is you won&#8217;t have to worry so much about not being able to pay rent. At least until you find a way around it.</p>

<p>There are several options to consider when it comes to rent payment plans. What you settle for will depend on your financial situation and what makes both you and your property manager comfortable. Let&#8217;s take a look at the usual options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-paying-a-lump-sum-at-an-agreed-date">1. Paying a lump sum at an agreed date</h3>



<p>You can agree to pay a lump sum to cover all your owed rent at a set date. In the meantime, you&#8217;ll have a chance to build your savings for a month or two, so you can meet the target.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-making-payments-in-installments">2. Making payments in installments</h3>



<p>When you choose the rent installments plan, any money you owe is spread out over an agreed period. The time for repayment is usually longer. As compensation for the extra time, the landlord adds interest to the rent installment. The only drawback of this rent payment plan is the fact that you&#8217;ll pay back higher than you owed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-paying-at-the-end-of-your-lease">3. Paying at the end of your lease</h3>



<p>You can choose to defer any rent you owe until the end of your lease period. This is even better if you&#8217;ll be getting back your security deposit in full. You can ask your property manager or landlord to use the security deposit to cover the repayment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-hybrid-plan">4. Hybrid plan</h3>



<p>You can merge elements from the rent arrears repayment plans we already mentioned. For example, you could pay back some parts as rent installments and then choose to cover the rest as a lump sum.</p>



<p>Otherwise, you could pay a big chunk of the amount you owe and leave the rest until the expiration of your lease.</p>

<p>Really, there&#8217;s no reason <em>not</em> to ask for a rent payment plan.</p>



<p>If your landlord or property manager doesn&#8217;t initiate the move, make sure you do. Consider your situation and propose a rent payment plan that&#8217;s right for you.</p>



<p>A rent payment plan considers your financial limitations to put together a strategy. This means you&#8217;ll be able to pay your rent, whatever challenges get in the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The big question on everyone’s lips (well, on our lips at least) is how did the rental market change due to coronavirus? At Roomi, we don’t focus on the entire rental market (full apartments, houses, condos, etc.) but on single rooms. We decided that the best way to figure out what the impact of coronavirus has been on real estate in the United States is by studying our own exclusive data.</p>



<p>So, we gathered some key Roomi facts from March 2020, and compared them to September 2020.</p>



<p>And guess what, guys? The outcome wasn’t as grim as so many predicted early on in the year! In fact, people are branching out and finding new roomis now more than ever! So, whether you’re <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-hunting-in-la-part-1-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">renting in Los Angeles</a>, Boston or NYC, you can count on Roomi to have fresh listings from people all across the states who are ready to become your next roommate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How did the change in rental market impact Roomi? </h2>



<p>Well, for starters, Roomi had 9600 new registered users in March, and 18,900 sign-ups in September. The short-term rental sector first blossomed following the last recession, with more people appreciating the value that a sharing economy could offer &#8211; especially in uncertain times when many are reluctant to take on a long-term lease or unable to buy their own property. So, there has certainly been a change in the rental market in this regard.</p>



<p>Coronavirus doesn’t seem to have negatively impacted the short-term market; in fact, it’s only spurred it on. When the pandemic first began taking over our lives, 9600 individuals signed up for a Roomi account. In fact, 18,900 people signed up to our platform in September when COVID-19 was in full swing. </p>



<p>Becoming more mainstream by the likes of Airbnb and Roomi, it seems that short-term rentals are here to stay. As more young people are changing the way they travel, work and live, they’re signing up to platforms such as ours to enjoy that flexibility they want &#8211; and need, especially in times like these. The long-term impact of coronavirus on real estate is still revealing itself.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There were 28,300 active listings on Roomi in March, compared to 88,900 in September.</h2>



<p>Fewer people were travelling at the start of the pandemic because of the obvious risk factor. People were reluctant to move &#8211; and who could blame them? </p>



<p>However, it seems that as time has gone on, many of us have learned to live with the pandemic. Aside from those in high-risk groups, we’re noticing many people trying to live their lives as normally as possible. For many, that means having to share their homes with strangers, as living alone is unaffordable. So while there has been a noticeable change in the rental market, people have learnt to cope with it.</p>



<p>We saw a surge of new Roomi listings in September, compared to earlier on in the year. It’s likely that as many people move back in with their family, or partners, lots of rooms are opening up around the states, and landlords and leaseholders just can’t afford to keep them open while we wait for the end of COVID.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There were a total of 550,000 profile views in March, with 1,500,000 in September, and 17,400 unique users submitted a rental request in March, compared to 29,000 in September.</h2>



<p>The good news is Americans are taking action to find their perfect room or roommate match. In February, before coronavirus hit, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/coronavirus-pandemic-cuts-rent-growth-to-a-decade-low.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rent growth for single-family homes</a> had hit its highest pace in four years. Just three months later, it was at its lowest growth rate in a decade. So, the impact of coronavirus on real estate has been massive. This slowdown in rent growth was most dramatic for higher-end rentals. As you can see, the demand for more expensive properties has clearly dropped. So, there has clearly been quite a bit of change in the rental market.</p>



<p>The demand for single room rentals, on the other hand, hasn’t been impacted in the same way. One million extra profile views were made in September compared to March, with rental requests jumping from 17,400 to 29,000 in that period. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For those that are contemplating making the move to LA, the only informing factor to all following decisions should be the fact that Los Angeles is gigantic, enormous, and huge. Besides being massive, LA is also at an average of $640,000 for a typical home, having a growing number of people unable to buy a home. The only resolve to their situation then becomes renting an apartment in Los Angeles. More than half the people in Los Angeles are renting properties, making it the fourth-highest percentage of renters in the nation.</p>



<p>Check out our Roomi rent report to find out more about average <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-december-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">room prices in the U.S.</a> in December 2020.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>According to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zumper&#8217;s National Rent Report</a> &#8211; LA maintains its spot in the top ten most expensive cities to rent in the US &#8211; with the average rent for a one-bedroom at $2,020 &amp; a two-bedroom at $2,820.</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>But what is the rental process like when you&#8217;re ready to make the move to LA? What are the steps following your decision to be renting in Los Angeles? What are some of the things you should consider when finding an apartment in the city of angels? </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide to finding your space in Los Angeles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Questions to ask yourself when searching for an apartment to rent in Los Angeles.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s</strong> <strong>your budget?</strong></h3>



<p>Answer the defining questions first. By that we mean, try looking up the latest median costs for the apartment size <em>that&#8217;s best for you</em>. </p>



<p>For instance, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apartment List</a> states the median rent for a one-bedroom in LA to be $1545 and $2027 for a two-bedroom. </p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve decided on your budget, <strong>do not forget to take into account the security deposit, first (and probably last) month&#8217;s rent, and an application fee of up to $50.</strong> (Note: Some landlords demand that your income be thrice the amount of your total rent).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What neighborhood is best for me to be renting in Los Angeles?</strong></h3>



<p>The best bet you can make for (sort of ) easy living in an apartment in LA, is picking a house close to where you work. At peak rush hour, it takes over two hours on a bus to get from one end of the town to another. If you&#8217;re unable to find a neighborhood close to work, try looking for a neighborhood that falls close to a well-connected bus route. Additionally, it should also not be far enough to become an expensive cab ride on a tipsy night.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/lol-la-thumbs-up-3o752gga17aO8OlQWI"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/3o752gga17aO8OlQWI/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Los Angeles Lol GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are my options besides apartment finding websites?</h3>



<p>With websites like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi</a>, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Zillow</a>, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://zumper.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zumper,</a> you wouldn&#8217;t need to hire a realtor. But oftentimes, once you&#8217;ve left for a search in an area, it can be quite beneficial to search for other properties in that area, on foot. This is a method that has proved effective for numerous people. Since landlords prefer renting to locals, you&#8217;re more likely to stumble on a place that isn&#8217;t listed online.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is renting an apartment in Los Angeles different from New York City?</h2>



<p>While you probably wouldn&#8217;t have exhausted the same energy as you would when apartment hunting in New York. Be it a steeper budget or a coveted neighborhood, you might just find yourself unable to find your dream oasis, when renting an apartment in Los Angeles is your goal. And that&#8217;s okay. You might just need to manage your expectations better. Considering, well, <a href="https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/rates.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the vacancy rate in LA</a> is at 3.9% right now, and bidding wars for rentals don&#8217;t just get ugly on TV.</p>



<p><em>Several <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.realtor.com/advice/rent/why-right-now-is-prime-time-for-negotiating-rent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">surveys</a> indicate that tenants renting in Los Angeles have more leverage during the winter months &#8211; making them the ideal time to move. Fewer people are concerned with moving amidst cold or bad weather, so you are likely to find better deals when it&#8217;s cold outside.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Things to know when you&#8217;re visiting an apartment you could be potentially renting in Los Angeles.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/thehills-the-hills-104-l2JdTy6mg3vViNwUU"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/l2JdTy6mg3vViNwUU/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C324&#038;ssl=1" alt="Los Angeles La GIF by The Hills - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="324" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>When you&#8217;ve finally come across a couple or more apartments that you like, take a day out to review them in person. You&#8217;ll likely be dealing with the apartment manager, the landlord, or a management company. </p>



<p>Some things you should be on the lookout for are:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Holes in the corners of the room?!</h4>



<p>These are common, and they most definitely indicate a bug infestation. Take this up with the building manager before you move in, and if you really like the place, request a deep clean and fixes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Do not be alarmed if you don&#8217;t see a fridge or a stove!</h4>



<p>Some landlords in LA just don&#8217;t provide one and you may need to bring your own.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other questions you must ask when looking at the apartment you may be renting in Los Angeles.</h4>



<p>Is the parking suitable for your needs? What about the place&#8217;s pet policy? Is there a pet deposit? Just some questions you don&#8217;t want to be looking for answers for <em>after signing a lease.</em></p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">If you&#8217;ve found an apartment in LA that you would like to rent, should you apply right away?</h3>



<p>As mentioned before, the market is very tight. It is recommended that you submit an application the moment you find a place you like. </p>



<p>Getting your dream oasis, especially in Los Angeles often comes down to two things: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Being the first one to apply. </li><li>Having a good credit score. </li></ul>



<p>Keeping your previous landlord&#8217;s info, employer&#8217;s reference and bank statements handy will also help you speed up the process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Rent Control for apartments in Los Angeles like?</h2>



<p>Rent Control essentially keeps a check on how much your rent is raised every year. Everyone calls it <em>Rent Control</em>, but the concept in itself is referred to as <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hcidla2.lacity.org/tag/rent-stabilization-ordinance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">rent stabilization.</a> </p>



<p>This basically means two things &#8211; one, over the longer term, tenants in rent-controlled units end up paying less, and two, these units come with protection measures for tenants who are evicted unfairly.</p>



<p>There is rent control in other cities of LA County as well. However, the measures might differ. Here&#8217;s where you can find more information on <a href="https://la.curbed.com/2018/6/4/17302800/rent-control-los-angeles-rules-guide/comment/477265563" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rent control in LA</a>.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all, folks! Happy hunting!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Some of us might be benefiting from the whole work from home situation due to coronavirus. But it can become a cause of great panic for some. From budget cuts to being out of a job, any scenario that affects your income ultimately affects your living situation. Especially when you think you can&#8217;t pay your rent and you don&#8217;t see any rental assistance in view.</p>



<p>If you can&#8217;t pay your rent, you might even fear eviction. And there&#8217;s a lot of doubt and panic that surrounds renters in this pandemic stricken era.</p>



<p>Some of us might be barely making it, and some of us might not be making it at all. Even if you&#8217;re actively looking out for another job, the job conversion might end up taking more time than we&#8217;d like.</p>



<p>Which brings us to a very crucial question. What to do if you can&#8217;t pay your rent due to coronavirus?</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve put in the research and have gathered some things you should do if you can&#8217;t pay your rent. One of the most important things that we&#8217;d like you to remember is NOT to lose hope.</p>



<p>Here are some things you should look into if can&#8217;t pay your rent. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Research your state&#8217;s eviction protection programs if you can&#8217;t pay your rent</h2>



<p>Things look grim with the CARES Act as a rental assistance. As it applies only to a few properties regarding rent, and the act itself expiring. But you need to know where your state is with regard to the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-coronavirus-has-impacted-rent-prices-in-u-s-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact on rent due to coronavirus</a>. Also whether you can get any aid if you can&#8217;t pay your rent. </p>



<p>Find out whether your state is renewing the ban on evictions or not. If your state is not doing anything to help and you fear financial delinquency, get in touch with a lawyer for free with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legal Aid</a>. Understand your rights and what course of action would be best for you if you&#8217;re unemployed and can&#8217;t pay your rent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Tell your landlord that you can&#8217;t pay your rent</h2>



<p>The best rental assistance for you would be if your landlord understands that you can&#8217;t pay your rent. And if they&#8217;re willing to make a compromise in terms of rent. </p>



<p>However, we&#8217;ve come across both types of landlords in the news. The ones who have foregone any rent from their renters until they manage to find a source of income. And those who are staying rigid when it comes to rent. Or even inflicting more unreasonable terms concerning any stimulus check or aid you might be receiving if you&#8217;re unemployed (if any).</p>



<p>While you should try your best to convince your landlord to agree, don&#8217;t give in to unreasonable demands.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Suggest restructuring rent payments till things get better</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;ve been a good renter and have always paid the rent on time, the chances are that your landlord will understand if you can&#8217;t pay your rent right now. Try speaking honestly with your landlord about your situation. Also inform them of how long you expect to take to get up back on your feet again.</p>



<p>After the conversation, if your landlord agrees to help you out, make sure you put it all on paper with signatures. Simply so there&#8217;s no chance of them retracting from their word in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Reach out to local aid when you can&#8217;t pay your rent</h2>



<p>Fortunately enough, some organizations are actively working to offer rental assistance if you can&#8217;t pay your rent, and face the risk of eviction or homelessness due to coronavirus. Reach out to your <a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/housing-and-homeless-assistance/homeless-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">state&#8217;s housing organizations </a>and<a href="https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> housing assistance</a> to take the help that you need. You can find out about the organizations<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-how-to-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> working to help and get help </a>for people (in terms of rent, food, and other necessities) most affected by the pandemic financially.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Apply for a loan</h2>



<p>If nothing works out, you can find out what<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/what-banks-are-doing-to-help-americans-affected-by-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> banks are doing to help citizens affected by the coronavirus pandemic</a>. Leverage the rental assistance plans on offer and take out a loan while you hustle to get a viable source of income. Don&#8217;t worry about an increase in debts if a much more significant concern for you is that you can&#8217;t pay your rent. Remember to take one step at a time to solve your problems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Take in more roomis or move out</h2>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">List your room</a> to find another roomi. Even though you might end up being cramped for space, you&#8217;ll be helping yourself and others. If your landlord isn&#8217;t onboard, tell them that you can&#8217;t pay your rent alone and make them understand that this could be the only way you would be able to manage.</p>



<p>If you can&#8217;t afford your current place, find a cheaper room or bunk in with friends or family till things settle down.</p>



<p>And they will, soon enough.</p>

<p>Every landlord has good things to say about their property. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/a-first-time-renters-brilliant-guide-to-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you&#8217;re new to renting</a>, you might find it challenging to navigate through the criteria by which an apartment becomes desirable. With open queries (like what&#8217;s your late-fee policy? How is the water pressure? Can I sublet?) you can get to know more about the property and the landlord&#8217;s expectations. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a list of 20 questions compiled by Roomi that will help you gain more perspective on whether or not you should rent that gorgeous space you&#8217;ve been eying.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. When is the apartment available?</h2>



<p>Match your move-in date with the landlord&#8217;s start date. It&#8217;s challenging to find an apartment that ticks all the boxes, so if the move-in date does not match yours, see if you can have a conversation with your potential landlord to find a solution you&#8217;re both happy with.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Is there a rental deposit?</h2>



<p>Despite some state laws prohibiting the practice, many landlords go for non-refundable deposits and have them printed in the lease. It&#8217;s best to do your research and check the agreement thoroughly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. What is the lease duration?</h2>



<p>If the landlord wants a lease for two years and can only commit one year, no matter how perfect the apartment is, you need to move on and check other places. You do have an option of subletting – but consent from your landlord is essential here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. How is the water pressure?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s important to check all taps in the kitchen and bathroom. Ask the landlord about the shower pressure and how long it takes for water to heat in the morning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. What are the amenities?</h2>



<p>This is one of the most important questions to ask before renting. Check if all amenities are in working condition, and document the &#8216;before&#8217; pictures of all the appliances provided. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-apartment-features-check-signing-lease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If there&#8217;s a gym or a pool in your apartment building</a>, check for timings and the policy on guest usage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. What is the room&#8217;s heating situation?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to check whether you have control over your room&#8217;s temperature regulation. Often, your landlord has the back-end control of the temperature. So, make sure you ask them if it&#8217;s possible for you to regulate the temperature.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. How is cell reception?</h2>



<p>Can you imagine yourself leaning out of your window trying to get a cell network or scurrying into a corner of the room for a better signal? And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a good idea to check for phone reception in your potential apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Who accepts the deliveries to the property?</h2>



<p>You may want all your parcels or UPS or FedEx deliveries taken by a supervisor or authorized person in the absence of a doorman. Ask if these options are available.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Is it noisy?</h2>



<p>Noise can be disruptive, especially if you are going to be working from home. Whether it&#8217;s<a href="https://noisefree.org/how-to-complain-about-apartment-noise-successfully/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> noisy neighbors</a>, loud music, or TV, it affects the quality of your lifestyle. Some landlords have a &#8216;quiet hour policy&#8217; included in the housing agreement. Check with your potential landlord if noise is something that could bother you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Who is responsible for managing common areas?</h2>



<p>Some landlords take the responsibility upon themselves to maintain common areas like the hallway, elevator, and porch. It is also common for some landlords to charge an annual or monthly maintenance fee. It&#8217;s best to know some of your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/five-common-questions-about-renters-rights-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rights as a renter</a> in your state to clarify this one, so ask the right questions to your landlord.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">11. What is the guest policy?</h2>



<p>In many areas, the landlord or the building manager needs to be informed if you&#8217;re having a long-term guest or visitor coming over. Do ask your landlord beforehand if you plan on having a guest over for more than a week to avoid sneaking around.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">12. Is there parking available?</h2>



<p>High-density areas have permit and license requirements for parking. With tightly cramped apartment blocks, it may be a challenge to park your car if you drive one. Ask your landlord if there&#8217;s a parking spot reserved for the building residents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">13. Are pets allowed?</h2>



<p>A necessary question before renting! If you own a pet, it is a good idea to check for pet policy with your landlord to avoid unnecessary fines later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">14. Can you sublet?</h2>



<p>What happens if your work requires you to travel for a few months, or what if you&#8217;re going away for a long trip? <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/is-it-legal-sublet-room-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subletting will help you pay rent for the months</a> where you&#8217;re personally not using the space. A fair request from the landlord&#8217;s end might be to adhere to his guidelines and meet his screening criteria, which seems like a fair deal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">15. What is the late-fee policy?</h2>



<p>Check with the landlord on the late-fee policy. Every state allows late fees within their guideline and state limit. It&#8217;s best to do your research on the late-fees policy to avoid paying a higher late fee.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">16. Mode of paying rent</h2>



<p>What methods for rental payments will the landlord accept? Online payment is an easy and convenient option. Also, avoid landlords who only insist on cash payments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">17. Termination</h2>



<p>Another important question to ask before renting! Does your landlord allow early lease termination? Some landlords may provide early termination of the lease, but might ask you to pay a fee for the months you signed up. Get clarity on this if you have uncertain plans for your stay in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">18. Lease renewal</h2>



<p>Can the lease be renewed? What if you want to go month-to-month after your lease expires? It helps to know the landlord’s perspective on this as some plan to sell the property, and you may not know their intention unless you ask them this question.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">19. Which furnishings or appliances are part of the rental lease?</h2>



<p>As a practice, some states require the renters to install their own devices, while in many others, the landlord installs them. For the latter, it might be a good idea to check the working condition of the appliances. You might also need to ask for an upgrade if required.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">20. Neighborhood safety</h2>



<p>Has there been a break-in, theft, or assault on this property? You may not get a direct answer to this question, but at least the landlord knows that you take safety seriously. You can check police or public records for accurate answers if you need to. It might not seem like it, but this is one of the most important questions to ask your landlord for your own safety.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Most NYC renters are familiar with the challenges that come with paying rent on time. In between trying the city’s newest restaurants and rooftop bars, prioritizing our finances can feel like a fine art. One that can take <em>a lot </em>of discipline. And most youngsters don&#8217;t stop and think how their decisions could impact their credit score. Here’s the bad news- the ramen and the Bloody Marys are gonna have to wait. Because late rent payments affect your credit score!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>So, what if your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-late-paying-rent/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate is late paying rent</a>, or if you’re falling behind on your own payments? Does this really have an impact on your credit score? Here’s what you need to know about sticking to the agreed-upon payment schedule.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-to-your-credit-score-if-you-don-t-pay-on-time">What happens to your credit score if you don’t pay on time?</h2>



<p>Right now, on-time rent payments don’t positively add to our credit score, while late payments can negatively affect our score. Seems a bit unfair, right? That’s why city comptroller Scott Stringer has been fighting to <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/making-rent-count/overview-rent-credit/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make rent count</a>; arguing that renters should be allowed to add rent payments to their credit history, in the same way that home owners do for mortgage payments.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:76%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3orifboWZvOhWnYRvq" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3orifboWZvOhWnYRvq/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>While it might not seem like a big deal if you miss one or two rent payments, there could be some consequences further down the line:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-late-fees">1. <strong>Late fees.</strong></h3>



<p>If your rental agreement includes a late fee clause, then expect to part with a few extra dollars if you’re late. Check your agreement, since the cut-off time could be a few seconds, or you may receive a grace period of a day or two. Either way, aim to pay on time every month, because paying the fee doesn’t automatically clean up your rental history.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-rental-applications"><strong>Future rental applications.</strong></h3>



<p>When it’s <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-signs-time-move/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">time to move into a new apartment</a>, your future property manager will want to know about your track record. They might use property management software or might contact your current landlord, but late payments are a red flag and could get in the way of being accepted to your new dream place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eviction-risk"><strong>Eviction risk.</strong></h3>



<p>Eviction laws vary by state, but you could find yourself with a <em>notice of termination for cause </em>in your hand, signifying the start of the eviction process. In such a case, you’ll usually be given a set number of days to pay the rent in full. If you fail, you might be kicked out &#8211; which has a <em>huge </em>impact on your credit score.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-poor-credit-score"><strong>Poor credit score.</strong></h3>



<p>If your property management company reports late payments to credit score companies, your score will be impacted.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-credit-matter-anyway">Why does credit matter, anyway?</h2>



<p>Your credit score is kind of like your passport to the consumer economy; a good credit score is your ticket to securing <a href="https://www.wagedayadvance.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">payday loans</a> and mortgages in the future, when you need them most. Those with a low credit score (or missing one completely) could find themselves paying extra on their phone contracts, insurance and credit cards interest rates.</p>



<p>You could notice both short-term and long-term consequences, with late payments staying on your credit history for as long as seven years!&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can request your <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit reports online</a>, to make sure yours are looking healthy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-you-can-t-pay-rent">What if you can’t pay rent?</h2>



<p>Repeatedly missing payment deadlines is a big no-no, but we’re all human and sometimes the unexpected happens. If you expect that you’ll be short on funds for an upcoming rent payment, there are some things you can do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talk to your property manager about short-term cash flow issues. Let them know the date you can make payment (as long as it’s only a few days after the deadline). They might just be able to let it slide &#8211; just this once. Remember, though, this isn’t the case for everyone. The best approach is to create automatic monthly bank transfers, so you don’t need to remind yourself to pay every month.</p>



<p>If this is an ongoing issue and you’re struggling to pay rent more than once, it’s time to make a change. Consider taking on an extra roommate, looking for a new source of income or moving to a more affordable pad.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you can expect to pay as rent in NYC is greatly dependent on how much money you make and how much of a sucker you are. JK, income doesn’t matter that much, you’ll probably over spend any way. The general recommendation is that rent should be no more than </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.lendkey.com/resources/how-much-of-your-income-should-you-spend-on-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your income. Thus a monthly income of $5,000 should strive to pay no more than $1,500 (5,000 x .3)/month. NYC is very much about give and take. And since the city has a lot to offer, it has no qualms with taking. Keep in mind, while you do want to live comfortably in the city, committing to apartments in New York over your budget is a guaranteed way to get into debt. Here is how much rent you can expect to spend from each </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.nycgo.com/boroughs-neighborhoods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC borough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bronx</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Yankees, Botanical Gardens, and the Bronx Zoo are some undeniable built-in amenities the Bronx offers along with art deco to marvel. Between Morris heights and University Heights the average rent in NYC is $1350/month. If Bronx is of interest to you get in quick, </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.metro.us/new-york/bronx-rent-increases-are-outpacing-manhattan-brooklyn/zsJpha---F8OS9GTha9YN6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the rates are increasing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">faster than others. </span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/s/Bronx+NY+USA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HERE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are spaces that are lower than the average. </span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Queens</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A personal fav- <a href="https://bit.ly/2QmdcDO" class="broken_link">Queens</a> is the epicenter of international cuisine. From authentic Greek in Astoria to Flushing’s Chinese fair, this borough is for New York&#8217;s foodies. This and a few other reasons may be why it is a little costlier to rent in NYC Queens than Brooklyn. With a recent 5% increase, median rental price in Queens is $2,550 ( for a studio). With all the outings to be enjoyed, this is a great place to shack up with roommates. That way you have more money in your pocket for ALL the gyros. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes no more than a single visit to be convinced to live in Brooklyn. My first walk along Brooklyn Heights Promenade is all it took me. To be near the live street music and dining scene and average rent in NYC will be $2,400/month for your own pad in Brooklyn. Or do what I did and have house mates, cutting this cost into thirds. Having roommates afforded me to live in the city of my dreams without drowning in the cost.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Manhattan</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason people romanticize Manhattan and it has nothing to do with Sex and the City. Manhattan is home to Time Square, Broadway, and pretty much everything food and entertainment, and of course great apartments in New York. Among the concrete jungle there are even hidden green spaces. In this famously expensive borough average rent in NYC for a 1 bedroom is </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/manhattan-studio-rent-breaks-records-2015-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3,400/month and counting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://bit.ly/2QmdcDO" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Staten Island</a></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forgotten borough&#8230;coming in at an impressive rent average rent in NYC of $1300/month for a 1 bedroom. New Yorkers should be ashamed of ignoring the island. Yes, it is a pain in the ass to take the ferry to get to the city, but there are so many other goodies that make up for the trek. Did I mention rent is actually affordable? Beyond this, Staten Island is much less crowded. </span>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">nd </span>it&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">perfect if you’re a nature lover. The most affordable borough may cost you travel time, but you won’t hear your bank account complaining. </span>Moreover, o<span style="font-weight: 400;">ne lesson NYC taught me was to work harder and spend smarter. Be reasonable with your expectations and budget when window shopping apartments in New York City. Regardless of the four walls you choose to sleep in, you’re still in the big city.</span></p>
