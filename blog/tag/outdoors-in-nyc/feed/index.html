<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Watch Toggenburg Goats graze in Queens</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/cupcakepunk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tumblr_mqq7iniaNt1r7yxrco1_1280.jpg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="Baby toggenburg goats running in NYC outdoors"/><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://cupcakepunk.com/baby-goats-gone-wild/">Baby Goats Gone Wild</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Spanning over 47 acres in Glen Oaks, <a href="http://queensfarm.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Queen&#8217;s County Farm Museum</a> is the longest continuous farmed site in the state, dating back to 1697.</p>



<p>The farm is open seven days a week, all year round for the interested and curious to come to visit and see how the farm operates, to see the animals &#8211; which include the two Dexter steers, the smallest cattle breeds in the world at 900 pounds, sheep, two heritage breed pigs, laying hens, Italian honeybees, and a mix of Nubian, Toggenburg, Lamancha, and — as of 2016 — Saanen goats!</p>



<p>During fall, you can also catch the pick-your-own pumpkin patch and a corn maze that&#8217;s shaped like a Unisphere.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Become a beekeeper! ?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/549e33afe4b004237f8243d1/549e3a03e4b031a7658b46e4/55b0d9d9e4b06fc585b69c77/1528232246255/?format=1500w" alt="One of the most interesting things to do in the outdoors of NYC is beekeeping!

<p>Yep, you heard us right. First, it&#8217;s completely&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/description/beekeeper-registration" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal in New York to keep honeybees</a>. Second, you&#8217;re literally saving the world if you take this up!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2008/nov/21/wildlife-endangeredspecies" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here&#8217;s more on that before we move ahead.</a></p>



<p>All you need to do is register your hive with the city. If you have a spacious balcony, rooftop, or even a backyard garden situation, the New York City Beekeepers Association can help you with connecting yourself to a hive through their&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bees.nyc/host-a-hive" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Host A Hive Program.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Plant flowers in Tryon Park</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Canoe through the Gowanus Canal</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/TheThing_Movie_NVergalla_08-e1595531322804.jpg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="gowanus-dredgers-paddle-in-movie"/><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/24/nycs-gowanus-canal-now-a-pandemic-safe-venue-for-summer-fun/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The best thing about the Gowanus Canal, outside the looks it serves, is that the&nbsp;<a href="https://gowanuscanal.org/self-guided-voyages" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Gowanus Dredgers</a>&nbsp;lend out three-person boats which are cleaned between each use, that too for free on most Wednesdays from 6-8 p.m. and Saturdays from 1-5 p.m. so that guests can explore the estuary at their own speed on a half-hour self-guided paddle!</p>



<p>This is one of the most fun things to take up in NYC on a weekend, especially when you feel like exploring the gritty waterway infrastructure of the canal. And learn about the canal that was infamously named after Gouwane, a Lenape chief — and the variety of industrial buildings that dot its banks. For those wondering, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/24/nycs-gowanus-canal-now-a-pandemic-safe-venue-for-summer-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gowanus Canal is also a COVID safe venue now!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Visit a Naval Cemetery turned walkway</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brooklyngreenway.org/wp-content/uploads/170716_21-06-51__Y9A8884.jpg?fit=1200%2C696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Naval Cemetery Landscape at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, on the best things to visit and do in the outdoors of NYC"/></figure>



<p>After staying indoors in New York for even a couple of months, you best bet that all popular parks and spots. Prospect Park, Herbert Von King, and Central Park’s Ramble are going to be particularly overdone. So when it comes to NYC outdoors, the Naval Cemetery Landscape at the Brooklyn Navy Yard &#8211; which reopened in 2016 with new walkways and plants after being shut for close to a century &#8211; become perfect exploration spots.</p>



<p>Other similar places include the Heather Garden, a steeply done three-acre piece of Fort Tryon Park!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Count birds and stars at the roof of the Jarvits Center</h2>



<p>The convention center boasts a 6.75-acre green roof where visitors can see up to 29 species of birds. in the past, enthusiasts have photographed Canada geese, American Kestrels, herring gulls, great black-backed gulls, mourning doves, and northern mockingbirds, among others. Others include three honeybee hives and five different bat species.</p>



<p>This space also helps reduce energy consumption in the convention center through its r<a href="https://www.greenroofs.com/projects/jacob-k-javits-convention-center/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">egulation of roof temperature</a>. They also provide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javitscenter.com/sustainability/green-roof-tours/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">free tours</a>&nbsp;via appointments only.</p>
