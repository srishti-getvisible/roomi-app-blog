<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability in Portland</h3>



<p>With Nike and Adidas’s North American headquarters located in Portland, it’s no wonder that it according to <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/today/2016/06/portland_makes_top_10_of_natio.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oregon Live</a>, Portland is the 7th most walkable city in the US. You will have no trouble trusting your feet when you want to explore the city, as many of its resident do. The city is also filled with green pastures, which make hiking a popular hobby for most residents.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Roads/traffic in Portland</h3>

Drivers should be careful about watching out for bikes, as most roads have a shared bike lane. Ensure that you familiarise yourself with specific traffic rules, such as knowing when you can turn left or right, or using mobile phones with hands-free accessories. Generally, traffic may not be a big issue, however, most people prefer to use public transport than cars.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis in Portland</h3>



<p>As the city is quite compact, if you plan on relying on Taxis, you won’t have to fork over a large fare. Typically, fares start from $3 with each additional mile adding another $3 to the fare. You may also have to pay $1 for each additional passenger, so keep that in mind of you’re planning on travelling with your roommate in Portland. Uber and Lyft are other reliable options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public Transportation in Portland</h3>

<p>When you think about sharing apartments with roommates, it sounds super fun! However, it comes with a lot of ups and downs that you need to be prepared for. Whether you&#8217;re trying to save money or have a tendency to feel isolated, having a roommate is a viable option. If you decide to venture <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/your-guide-for-shared-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing apartments</a> for rent with roommates, Roomi will help you understand the dynamics of what you are getting into.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros-of-sharing-apartments-with-roommates"><strong>Pros of sharing apartments with roommates</strong></h2>



<p>Here are some reasons why people decide on sharing <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/your-rights-as-an-apartment-tenant-4108505" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">an apartment</a>&nbsp;or room. These reasons apply to everyone, including college students and young adults looking to share apartments for rent with roommates.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You will split the cost of your living space and utilities and thus, save a lot of money.</li>



<li>If you share an apartment with friends, you&#8217;ll always have someone to share your day with. Otherwise too, it’s a great way to form new connections and friends!</li>



<li>There is an increased sense of security while sharing apartments for rent with roommates.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You might not get along with your roommate’s lifestyle, character or habits.</li>



<li>If one of you works the night shift while the other has a regular 9-to-5, it might be difficult to sleep when you need to.</li>



<li>If your roommate(s) turn out to be a moocher, things might get difficult. You don&#8217;t want to wind up footing the bill for a freeloader.</li>

<p>Before you even sign a lease with a roommate, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWKBbWUGTYU" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">talk through things</a> like trash removal, dust bunnies and policies on shoes (on or off?) in the apartment—and consider putting these agreements down on paper. This ensures a fair split of duties beforehand and avoids all awkward future confrontations.</p>



<p><em>But how do you put paper into practice?</em></p>



<p>Unless you’re like Monica from F.R.I.E.N.D.S, a wise approach to adopt is planning a weekly timetable with your roommates. Allot each day to a person and let the cycle repeat in the same order! This way you have an organized chores and cleaning schedule, and no one can slip out of their turn to clean.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in apartments for rent with roommates, if splitting chores isn’t working, then change your approach. The cleaner roommate can offer to take on more responsibility toward cleaning of the apartment while the other pays extra rent. Consider this as the messier roommate might be relieved when they don’t have to clean.</p>

<p>While it is nice to be friends with your roommate, one of the most vital roommate rules to remember is that you do not need to be close friends.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Are you a college student who is staying at home and taking online classes in the pandemic? As a student, moving out is hard enough. Renting an apartment in the midst of a pandemic can add to the challenge. You may wonder, do you need credit to rent an apartment?  How do you even begin searching for apartments for rent without being able to see them in person?</p>



<p>University life in the States means looking forward to a path of learning and networking while also having fun and making memories. Unfortunately, this year we have attended more virtual meetings than <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://attentiv.com/america-meets-a-lot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">ever recorded</a>. This means that studying and working from home has become the new norm, but once school ends, you might be itching to fly the nest and find a place of your own.</p>



<p>Roomi offers some tips to find yourself the perfect cozy apartments for rent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Renting an apartment: How to start your search!</h2>



<p>The coronavirus pandemic has had a shifting effect on apartments for rent. For example, cities like Los Angeles, Miami, Seattle, and Houston have observed a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/apartment-guide-annual-rent-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decrease in rent</a> compared to New York City, New Orleans, and Phoenix. The ideal time to begin your search for your apartment is at the end of the month before the target move month. Make sure you check for things like, do you need credit to rent an apartment in a specific area?</p>



<p>This might seem very last minute, but most renters have leases that terminate at the end of a month or within the first few days of the following month. It&#8217;s a great idea to connect with your classmates and find out if they&#8217;re looking for a place to rent near your campus, and you can start the search together.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Decide if you want roommates when renting an apartment</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Check at least 2 or 3 places before you finalize a decision</h2>



<p>One common mistake most people make is settling way too early. You need to weigh up your options before you decide on a place. There are so many factors to consider before you sign the lease.</p>

<p>Considering the pandemic, your first visit will probably be a virtual one. You can set up a video call with the homeowner and get an online tour. Scan for places in your desired neighborhood within the same price range &#8211; it&#8217;s always good to have backup options.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Work with a checklist</h2>



<p>Make a checklist of the things to look for before viewing places. You may wonder things like, do you need credit to rent an apartment? This will help you to be thorough, so you can make your decision confidently. Some items that you will need on your checklist include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The location of the home and how long it will take to reach class in traffic (if and when classes resume)</li><li>Where exactly will you place your furniture in the rental, especially if you have a roommate?</li><li>Is the rental cost inclusive of any utilities?</li><li>Can you take along your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rentecdirect.com/blog/unauthorized-pet/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pet dog or cat</a>? Is there an additional fee?</li><li>Is the security deposit fully refundable? How much is the security deposit?</li><li>Is there an application fee?</li><li>Is the neighborhood known for a high crime rate?</li><li>How quiet is the area?</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep your security deposit ready</h2>



<p>Since competition is fierce, it&#8217;s wise to get your security deposit ready within 24 to 48 hours of acceptance. This way you will not lose out on your perfect home just because you did not make your security deposit in time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Read thoroughly before signing anything</h2>



<p>Before making any commitment, it is categorically essential that both you and your co-signer <em>thoroughly</em> read the entire rental agreement. Normally, rental agreements are like an adhesion document in the ‘take it or leave it’ style where the landlord has terms and conditions that are non-negotiable.</p>



<p>Therefore, it is fundamental that you grasp the legal terms and language in the contract. Pay attention to when the rent is due, maintenance of the grounds, and the section on&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rentecdirect.com/blog/late-rent-fees/#:~:text=When%20a%20renter%20pays%20rent%20late%2C%20most%20landlords,the%20terms%20are%20outlined%20in%20a%20lease%20agreement.)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">penalties</a>, in case you are late for rent.</p>
