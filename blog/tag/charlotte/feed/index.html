<p>From affordable living, <a href="https://www.nascarhall.com/" class="broken_link">NASCAR Hall of Fame</a>, and a love for the Carolina Panthers, the Queen City is a unique place to live in. Here’s why people are racing to find rooms for rent in Charlotte.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to Know Charlotte</h2>

When talking about the Queen City, it is hard to dodge references to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, or the delicious sweet tea that the state is famous for. However, Charlotte is a melting pot of diverse cultures, and has a lot to offer its residents.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability in Charlotte</h3>



<p>With a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/NC/Charlotte" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">walkability score of 26</a>, Charlotte is one of the least walkable cities in the US. It ranks 49th among the largest cities in the US in terms of walkability, meaning that it is a car-dependent city. Some neighborhoods like NoDa, South End and Uptown Charlotte are more walkable than others. Depending on where you find rooms for rent in Charlotte, you may need a car to complete your chores.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Roads/traffic in Charlotte</h3>



<p>Traffic in Charlotte can be quite slow, with congested roads, especially during the rush hour. On average, cars move at about 15 mph; you can expect to sit in your car for long intervals when trying to get anywhere.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis in Charlotte</h3>



<p>You won’t be hard-pressed to find taxi services in this city and the best part? They’re affordable as well. The base fare is $2.50 with an additional $0.50 for every kilometer, and a waiting fee of $30.00 per hour. A flat fare of $25 from Uptown to the Airport and vice versa also makes it easier to rely on them when you need to go anywhere. Alternatively, you can also opt for Uber and Lyft if you’re looking for online options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public transportation in Charlotte</h3>



<p>Although Charlotte is a car-dependent city, if you don’t have one, you won’t be left stranded. The city’s rail, streetcar, and bus system are quite efficient as well. The <a href="https://lightrail.uncc.edu/using-light-rail#:~:text=The%20LYNX%20Blue%20Line%20operates,campus%20107%20times%20each%20day.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">LYNX Blue Line Light Rail</a> is reliable and runs every 15 minutes during non-peak hours on the weekdays, and every 7.5 minutes during rush hours. On the weekends it runs every 20 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes during late-night hours. You can use the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://charlottenc.gov/cats/bus/Pages/mobile-apps.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CATSPass app</a> on your mobile phone to buy your $2.20 pass easily.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://charlottenc.gov/cats/transit-planning/gold-line/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CityLYNX Gold Line</a> is Charlotte’s streetcar system that connects the eastern and western parts of the city, allowing residents to travel to the business and educational district easily. Enjoy free rides every day of the week.</p>



<p>You can also opt for the <a href="https://charlottenc.gov/cats/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlotte Area Transit System</a> Bus service, which has over 70 routes across the city. When trying to get from the Airport to the city center, you can also opt for the <a href="https://www.charlottecentercity.org/transportation/sprinter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sprinter Bus Service</a>, which is a hybrid electric bus system that runs every 20 minutes on weekdays and every 30 minutes on the weekends.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Airports in Charlotte</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.cltairport.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlotte Douglas International Airport</a> serves the city and is quite well-connected. Passengers can hop on a cab, Uber, or a bus straight out of the airport and reach the city center at affordable prices. If you’re a tourist, you won’t have too much trouble navigating into the city from the airport.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Cycling in Charlotte</h3>



<p>Bike-sharing systems such as <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.spin.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spin</a>, <a href="https://mobike.com/global/" class="broken_link">Mobike</a> and <a href="https://www.li.me/" class="broken_link">LimeBike</a> are a few of the several bike-sharing programs in the city. Even if you do not own a bike, you will not miss out on the fun. Although using the bike-sharing programs is easy, and residents have the freedom to drop off the bike in any legal location they want, the city is not quite bike-friendly. Even with extensive bike-sharing programs, the city is sorely lacking in bike-friendly infrastructure, making most roads dangerous for bicyclists.</p>
