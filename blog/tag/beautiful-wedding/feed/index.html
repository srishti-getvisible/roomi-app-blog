										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After the roller coaster ride that was 2020, we’re all looking forward to a brighter 2021. Whether your wedding was rescheduled due to the pandemic or you’ve been planning a 2021 ceremony all along, 2021 wedding trends are all about taking a &#8216;smaller but bigger&#8217; approach. But what does that mean? It&#8217;s a combination of a visually beautiful wedding experience, while keeping in mind the safety of the guests.</p>



<p>So whether you’re <a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/new-wedding-trends" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">re-thinking your plans or starting from scratch</a>, we’re listing the trends that are set to be huge for next year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-micro-wedding-trends-are-on-the-rise">1. <strong>Micro wedding</strong> trends are on the rise</h2>



<p>When it comes to recent wedding trends, it&#8217;s no surprise that celebrations are staying on the smaller side for now. With couples being much more deliberate with their guest list, leading to more intimate and smaller scale weddings in 2021. This won&#8217;t stop you from having a beautiful ceremony!</p>

<p>Due to the restrictions on wedding sizes, many couples are also opting to hold multiple smaller celebrations. Newly engaged couples are also warming up to the idea of having their wedding celebrations on available dates during the weekdays which in turn, maybe a good option for those who are on a tighter budget.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-zoom-marriages-one-of-the-popular-wedding-trends">2. <strong>Zoom </strong>marriages: one of the popular wedding trends</h2>



<p>Zoom is no longer reserved just for work calls and your weekly virtual date nights. It has also allowed those unable to attend weddings in person to experience a little of the magic &#8211; <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/coronavirus/denver-couple-says-i-do-to-zoom-wedding-friends-and-family-watched-ceremony-at-their-homes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even if it&#8217;s only virtually</a>. There is now an option of live streaming for guests, to be part of the big day.</p>

<p>This unique yet beautiful wedding trend has been a common one throughout 2020 and it&#8217;s unlikely to go anywhere for 2021.</p>



<p>We are also seeing videographer companies launching the Zoom wedding package which includes hosting the Zoom wedding with technical support, playing of media (e.g. slideshows and music) and recording of ceremony footage, etc.</p>

<p>For all of 2020 and into 2021, the health, safety and hygiene of those attending and hosting all celebrations are at the forefront during planning.</p>

<p>Many couples are choosing to embrace the new normal and get creative! Wedding trends include, trying out functional favors like customized masks and mini sanitizer bottles with personalized stickers could be a great start!</p>



<p></p>



<p>Another fascinating trend to consider is incorporating <a href="https://www.goodstoneinc.com/collections/engagement-rings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique engagement rings</a> into your ceremony. As weddings become more personalized, many couples are choosing rings that reflect their distinct styles and personal stories. This shift marks a move towards individuality in wedding symbols, perfectly aligning with other trends such as Zoom marriages and micro-weddings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-up-your-aesthetic-game-to-have-a-beautiful-wedding">4. Up your aesthetic game to have a beautiful wedding!</h2>



<p>Many couples have had to postpone celebrations for months. Just so they could go all out and celebrate with their loved ones when times allow. And <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/2021-wedding-trends" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">smaller ceremonies</a> mean more budget can be used on areas such as decorations and food.</p>

<p>The digital &#8216;Save the Dates&#8217; serves the purpose of getting guests to actually save the date. Moreover, it also helps couples to get an initial idea of who would be able to come or not. As well as being more practical, the digital alternative proves to be one of the most eco-friendly <mark>wedding trends</mark>.</p>

<p>Your beautiful ceremony may be staying on the small side. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t still have fun and arrange gorgeous ceremonies for you and your guests to enjoy. With guest sizes being cut down, it also means more budget to create something lavish to make a statement with a smaller group.</p>



<p>Wedding invites are all getting more sustainable, with couples choosing to minimize waste, opting for greenery, and reusing decor. Consider giving out wedding flowers to guests as favors, using plant seed paper for printing, or sourcing local food and prod. These <mark>trends</mark> will truly make your beautiful day stand out!</p>
