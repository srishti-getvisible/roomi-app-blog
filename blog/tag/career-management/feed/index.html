										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Making a living while doing something we&#8217;re passionate about gives us a kind of personal freedom that most people crave. Pursuing our passions, whether they are in the form of a service, a hobby, or a business, is fundamental to reaching the most authentic version of us. Even if pursuing your passion means a change in profession, we must consider it, no matter what the stakes.<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/mindful-habits-for-your-mental-health-during-covid-19/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> What is this life, If we cannot stop for a second and marvel at every day and find joy in the little things</a>? It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;ve found your passion or are in the middle of exploring new horizons and finding a change in career for yourself. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a valuable takeaway for you from this blog.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-change-your-job-vs-change-your-profession">Change your job vs. Change your profession</h2>

<p>To clarify, changing jobs is moving to a similar position with a different employer and is usually relatively easy. Changing careers is a more in-depth shift and usually means moving to another industry, which requires an entirely different perspective. A career change usually means additional learning, retraining, and beginning a new career path from scratch.&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hobby-clubs-and-classes-in-new-york-where-you-can-meet-new-people-part-3/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">It isn&#8217;t easy and requires a leap of faith&nbsp;and a bit of bravery.</a></p>



<p>It&#8217;s never too late to make a career change. The timing needs to be right, with a strong foundation and a plan to move ahead. The hardest part is convincing yourself that you&#8217;re ready to do it â€“ <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-signs-time-move/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">and that you CAN do it</a>! To make a meaningful change, we want to highlight the preparation required. The suggestions here will help in preparing you for your career change. Are you ready?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-decide-where-you-want-to-go-next">1. Decide where you want to go next</h3>



<p>Take time to decide on what you would like to do next. It pays to know who you are, what makes you happy, and your strengths and weaknesses. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/7-career-tips-for-college-seniors-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Have you considered freelancing or starting a business?</a> Ask yourself some key questions to understand the direction you want to take.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-upgrade-your-skillset">2. Upgrade your skillset</h3>



<p>Check if you have the right skill set to move forward to mold your passion into your career. Suppose you have decided to become a freelance web developer. Can you code? Do you need to enhance your skills before forging a career? Do you require a web development course and need to build yourself a portfolio before making it your full-time profession? If you&#8217;re considering a move into data analysis or data science, enhancing your skillset with an <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">introductory R course</a> can be incredibly beneficial. The ability to handle complex analyses and large datasets is crucial in these fields. This course offers foundational knowledge that can serve as a stepping-stone for further learning and career advancement in various data-related tracks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-find-a-mentor">3. Find a mentor</h3>



<p>Having a mentor in your field can prove invaluable at this time, more so if you want to start your own business. Listen and follow your mentors closely, and don&#8217;t assume that you know everything already. As they are ahead in your field, build a relationship with them where you can ask them a zillion questions to clarify things in your mind and learn from their experiences.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-grow-your-network">4. Grow your network</h3>



<p>You may be eager to get out of your current job as quickly as possible. Still, handing in your resignation too soon could prove disastrous. Begin by building a support network while you&#8217;re at your current job. If you plan to freelance, your existing network is your best link to your future work. Use your contacts and build a relationship with people who might be of help. One meaningful way to move ahead with a successful career change is to realize that you don&#8217;t have to do it alone.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-you-are-your-own-brand">5. You are your own brand!</h3>



<p>You are your own unique selling point. Many people ignore this, but you can use your Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter to contact other professionals in your field. What you&#8217;re essentially selling here is trust to your clients/ customers in a market that seems brand new to you. Feel free to reach out and ask people in your area for help or advice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-set-your-goals-write-a-plan-of-action">6. Set your goals/ Write a plan of action</h3>

<p>It is a good idea to work backward. Outline your goals for the year detailing out your aims for the upcoming six months, and the following six weeks. Your first goal is to set yourself goals. Write daily objectives &#8211; small things you want to achieve over the next few months to get you out of your job and into a better career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Troubling to some, exciting to others, there&#8217;s a persistent question that comes around no matter what stage of life we may be tackling. It&#8217;s the question of planning your future, planning your career. This thought could surface in discussion with friends, your family, a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/answers-to-6-most-common-job-interview-questions-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job interviewer,</a> or your brain at 3 am. One of the biggest reasons that the majority of us don&#8217;t like to think about the future, or come up with a career plan for our future, has been backed by science. </p>



<p>Studies suggest that our <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/04/why-people-are-so-bad-at-thinking-about-the-future.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brains think of our future selves as strangers.</a> But this doesn&#8217;t mean we should let ourselves off the hook. In fact, it gives us an opportunity to think about our future selves with empathy and care, like we would other people.</p>



<p>We know it&#8217;s tough, and we&#8217;ve mostly come to associate this superhuman skill with the highest achievers, justifying to ourselves that we&#8217;re not one of them. So to make things easier, we&#8217;ve listed a few things you could think about to think about the future. It&#8217;s time to think about thinking about putting our thinking caps on! Yes, there&#8217;s quite a lot of thinking ahead.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506784850319-305956726452?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="person holding orange pen on to of journal beside Stabilo Boss highlighter, tracking her mood on a self made mood tracker in her journal, as she takes on her career plan"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Have a plan, but also, don&#8217;t have a plan</h2>



<p>Sounds confusing? Because it is! When you think about the future, the first thing that might come to mind is to make a plan that you could follow.</p>



<p>Maybe two years back, like a lot of us, you made a plan to travel the world in 2020. You know what we&#8217;re getting at. Plans tend to fail or get postponed. So don&#8217;t set rigorous timelines to whatever it is that you plan to do, whether you&#8217;re considering personal development or professional development backed by a career plan.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a clichÃ© because it makes sense to focus on your journey instead of your destination. Do that, and you&#8217;ll forget to ask, &#8216;Are we there yet?&#8217;</p>



<p>So have a general plan outlined, and fill in the colors on your beautiful and fulfilling journey as you go along.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Work for the tomorrow you want, today!</h2>



<p>If you wish to achieve a goal tomorrow, you have to start today! Maybe your career plan is to have your own business someday or have a job that gives you the freedom to travel. Whatever your dream is, wake up and start working towards it now. Put in the required amount of work for personal development and start becoming the person you want to be tomorrow from today. Like they say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t dress for the job you have, but for the one you want.&#8217;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Actively participate in your present to change your future</h2>



<p>Simply cribbing about your present and longing for a desirable future isn&#8217;t going to cut it. Everything you desire as a part of your professional or personal development has to be embedded into your life now. If you have some complaints about any current aspects of your life &#8211; maybe you have trouble managing your work hours, or perhaps you dislike the work you do for a living &#8211; it&#8217;s time to do something about it.</p>



<p>You need to start figuring out how and then start working towards eliminating what you don&#8217;t like. If it is out of your control, you could try changing your perception towards it. But your problems won&#8217;t disappear on their own, and your dreams won&#8217;t materialize on their own either.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Have someone to look up to</h2>



<p>One of the best ways for personal development is learning from other people. There is always something to learn if you look in the right direction. Make it a point to look up to someone you admire. Maybe it&#8217;s not someone who has it all, but someone who constantly works towards achieving what they need. It could be one of your friends, one of your relatives, your colleagues, or an inspiring TED talk. Let someone inspire you to become the best version of you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Don&#8217;t expect to know all the answers</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Because you can&#8217;t.</li><li>Life might become a very tedious ride if you have all the answers.</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020, for most of us, promised a bounty of opportunities, great clients, better paychecks, and a bright future. Well, many thanks to the pandemic, all our careers have taken a back seat without our consent. Due to this, we all have spent time grappling with the realities of life these past few months. So now, it&#8217;s time we use all the spare time to find motivation and fine-tune our personal development. Let&#8217;s find alternate ways to make our careers work for us!</p>



<p>Our&nbsp;recommendation&nbsp;would be to get stuck into some of these self-help books that will serve as&nbsp;career advice&nbsp;and motivation for all those seeking clarity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>1. David &amp; Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants</em>&nbsp;by Malcolm Gladwell</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;You can&#8217;t concentrate on doing anything if you are thinking, &#8220;What&#8217;s gonna happen if it doesn&#8217;t go right?&#8221; </em></p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/1439.Malcolm_Gladwell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malcolm Gladwell</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Gladwell&#8217;s narration in this book draws examples from infamous stories, how the world perceives them, and the reality. As humans, we instinctively avoid conflict and paths that look dangerous or unsafe. The book walks the readers through an array of stories and compelling historical examples of how someone who may look small can surprisingly be tough and beat the big.</p>



<p><em>Goodreads Rating: 4.34/5</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <em>So Good They Can&#8217;t Ignore You</em> by Cal Newport</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;the happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do. On reflection, this makes sense.&#8221; </em></p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/147891.Cal_Newport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cal Newport</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Most people feel that success comes from following your heart and passions. But Cal Newport begs to differ from this point of view. Newport says that developing skills rather than focussing on desires you already have is the key to successful job experiences. In addition, the book curates&nbsp;career advice&nbsp;by interviewing some of the most successful people; it has advice from everyone from farmers, venture capitalists, and freelancers. These interviews help the reader discover strategies and&nbsp;<strong>career management</strong>&nbsp;skills and personal development tips to enhance their job experiences.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <em>The Third Door</em> by Alex Banayan</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;You have a choice,&#8221; Dan said. &#8220;You can be good at those twenty-five things or you can be world-class at the five. Most people have so many things they want to do that they never do a single thing well. If I&#8217;ve learned one thing from Mr. Buffett, it&#8217;s that the Avoidance List is the secret to being world-class.&#8221; &#8220;Success,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is a result of prioritizing your desires.&#8221;</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/17391335.Alex_Banayan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Banayan</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>These successful individuals didn&#8217;t wait in line or follow the norms that most people support. Instead, they barged their way into success with hard work and determination.
