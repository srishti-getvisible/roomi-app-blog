<p>L.A. is known for its eclectic architecture. And this is just the start of the many things to see in LA, for a new resident or old. The humble ranch houses create quite the unique contrast against its Art Deco skyscrapers. But, a new (well, technically old) wave is resurfacing and it&#8217;s called Googie.</p>



<p>In the 1950s, L.A. created its very own style that was an optimistic culmination of a lot things. We saw bold colors, myriad materials, and very very daring geometry. Think of the TV cartoon&nbsp;<em>The Jetsons.</em>&nbsp;Yep, animators for the show mirrored Googie architecture for their inspiration for this futuristic cartoon.</p>

<p>However, this style was a little more than futurism and expression. It was meant to be strategic. The main goal being the construction of a building so eye-catching that as many passersby as possible stop by at these businesses. (The first-ever McDonald&#8217;s was a Googie!)</p>



<p>The architectural industry believes that Googie got its name when architecture critic Douglas Haskell was driving around Los Angeles researching a story on the new coffee shops in the city. The name dawned upon him when he came across an eclectic-looking&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googies_Coffee_Shop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coffee shop on Sunset Boulevard called Googies.</a></p>



<p>Here are some of our favorite Googie-inspired spots around the city!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Union 76 Station</h2>

<p>Built by Gin Wong, William Pereira &amp; Associates in 1965, Union Station boasts of strong and angular rooflines, which are often a reflection of new engineering techniques and are a common trait of Googie buildings.</p>



<p>This gas station, designed with an enormous, swooping roof, was originally intended to be part of LAX, but when another project was chosen for the airport instead, it was built in Beverly Hills as one of the many attractions of this part of the city.</p>

<p>Constructed in the year 1963, the Five Points Car Wash became the best example of Googie buildings representing the business they housed. Five Points Car Wash features a row of tall pylons that draws attention to the structure.</p>

<p>One of the earliest adopters of Googie was McDonald&#8217;s &#8211; when it first began its burger empire in the 1950s, the goal was to use alluring architecture.</p>



<p>Its first establishment included a 30-foot-high version of its now-famous “golden arches” that pierced the roof of the restaurant.</p>



<p>The materials used included: a variety of finished of stone, glass, metal linoleum, Formica, cork, concrete, brick, and plastic &#8211; inside and out!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>? Technicolor galore</strong>!</h3>



<p>If the foundation of Googie was a structurally appealing silhouette, then the icing on top was color and building materials. Googie architects made sure to use bold and contrasting colors to make the buildings just one of the many things that stand out about LA architecture. The materials used included: a variety of finished of stone, glass, metal linoleum, Formica, cork, concrete, brick, and plastic &#8211; inside and out!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Johnie&#8217;s Coffee Shop</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" data-attachment-id="11951" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/southern-las-googie-architecture/attachment/johns-coffee-shop/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Johns-Coffee-shop-.png?fit=1520%2C1013&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1520,1013" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="John&#8217;s Coffee shop" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Johns-Coffee-shop-.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Johns-Coffee-shop-.png?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Johns-Coffee-shop-.png?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" alt="John Coffee shop's Googie Architecture" class="wp-image-11951" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Johns-Coffee-shop-.png?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Johns-Coffee-shop-.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Johns-Coffee-shop-.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Johns-Coffee-shop-.png?w=1520&amp;ssl=1 1520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://la.eater.com/2015/1/29/7947403/googie-landmark-johnies-coffee-shop-lives-on-in-the-movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Eater</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Built by Armed and Davis in 1956, Johnie&#8217;s Coffee Shop stands in pride as it occupies a corner lot, which was built to give passersby a sense of its sharp angular roof. But it&#8217;s the blue &amp; white plaint, red sign, the stonework, and the perforated cladding that create all of its visual appeal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chips</h2>

<p>Built by Harry Harrison in 1956, Chips has a fairly restrained shape compared to its contemporaries. But its tall and bright teal sign commands all your attention. The angled letter look like they&#8217;re shifting towards you as you move past the building. The color scheme is also build to continue inside, with seafoam green stools and walls.</p>

<p>When Googie architecture first emerged in LA, there were mixed reactions to it. We also think it&#8217;s best to mention that our list only makes up the smallest part of the Googies that have existed in Los Angeles. Many of which are now lost. And as architectural styled changes, the Space Age Futurism of Googie fell out of favor. Googies, the John Lautner-designed coffee shop that launched the entire movement, was also demolished in the 1980s. Groups like the Los Angeles Conservancy have, however, consistently rallied to save these buildings. </p>



<p>Treat yourself to a sunny weekend drive-through for the infamous Randy&#8217;s Donuts. Or grab a cup o&#8217; joe from Norm&#8217;s — and take in the alluring visuals of the Googie colors, shapes, textures. And don&#8217;t forget the signage that made Googie SoCal&#8217;s signature style.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s our second part of our Googie series! In honor of all the Googie spots around Los Angeles that still stand in all their eclectic glory!</p>

<p>Built by Helen Fong and Armet &amp; Davis in 1958, Pann&#8217;s Coffee Shop stands with its flagstone walls and angular roof. Its large expanses of plate glass, and a really funky neon sign, are by far one of the best-preserved Googie in the city. If you feel like venturing inside, be prepared to be greeted by even more textures. For instance, the terrazzo floors, red vinyl booths, dark wood veneers, and cork finishes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">? <strong>The Googie Signage</strong>!</h3>



<p>A major stand-out point of Googie architecture, especially the kind that we see in Los Angeles is the signage — that does exactly what it&#8217;s supposed to: attract all attention. Googie architects experimented with custom typography, abstract symbols like starbursts and dingbats, neon lights, and more!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bob&#8217;s Big Boy Broiler</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.laconservancy.org/sites/default/files/styles/hero_full/public/images/heroes/BobsBigBoyBroiler_JohnEng.jpg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption>Source: <strong><a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/bobs-big-boy-broiler" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Conservancy</a></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Sure, this restaurant has been home to a number of establishments in the past — including a stint as a car dealership — but its impressive 65-foot-long neon sign has remained unchanged. For decades, Johnie&#8217;s Broiler nodded at passing motorists with its slimline roof and massive script sign. After an illegal demolition in 2007, the building&#8217;s rubble was restored by the franchise owner of Bob&#8217;s Big Boy in 2009 and has since been a home to the Googie glory of its past and Johnie&#8217;s &#8220;Fat Boy&#8221; Mascot!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Randy&#8217;s Donuts</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="629" height="450" data-attachment-id="11894" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/googie-architecture-in-la-part-2/attachment/image-6-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-6.png?fit=629%2C450&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="629,450" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-6" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-6.png?fit=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-6.png?fit=629%2C450&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-6.png?resize=629%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-11894" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-6.png?w=629&amp;ssl=1 629w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-6.png?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /><figcaption>Source: <strong><a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/randys-donuts" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Conservancy</a></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Since 1953 Randy&#8217;s Donuts has unmistakably been making mouths water with their iconic doughnut. At a little over 35 feet in diameter, the building adorns the crown of a humble donut and has been featured in movies such as Get Shorty and Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles, and television shows like Arrested Development and Entourage!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Norm&#8217;s Coffee Shop</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><a href="https://archinect.imgix.net/uploads/b7/b77e125e04f1f620d84c7ccf18fbde41?auto=compress%2Cformat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archinect.imgix.net/uploads/b7/b77e125e04f1f620d84c7ccf18fbde41?fit=crop&amp;auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;w=514" alt="A view of Norms, a googie architecture in LA classic" width="552" height="415" title="A view of Norms (image via flickr.com/ronslog)"/></a><figcaption>Source:<strong><a href="https://archinect.com/news/article/118449910/norm-s-coffee-shop-an-la-googie-icon-is-temporarily-saved-from-demolition" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Arch News</a></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Built by Helen Fong and Armet &amp; Davis in 1957, this is yet another example of a Googie building being a self-advertisement for the business it&#8217;s housing. The roof is shaped like a kite on the side, and then there&#8217;s the echoing sign with each block letter in the name Norm&#8217;s getting its own angular backdrop.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mel&#8217;s Drive-In</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" height="368" width="625" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.smconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1-Mels-Drive-In-via-Mels-Drive-In-625x368.png?resize=625%2C368&#038;ssl=1" alt="Mel's Drive In an iconic Googie architecture building in LA"/><figcaption>Source: <strong><a href="https://www.smconservancy.org/property/melsdrivein/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santa Monica Conservancy</a></strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>This bright and glaringly iconic spot in West Hollywood once housed the rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll coffee shop hangout, Ben Frank&#8217;s. </p>



<p>Today you are most likely to run into hungry late-night tourists on the prowl for banger burgers and the search for a celebrity or two — but mind you, this doesn&#8217;t make the diner any less enjoyable! Similar to Sunset Strip&#8217;s off-center A-frame, the Sherman Oaks location of Mel&#8217;s Drive-In features a single swooping roof and stands out as one of the earliest examples of Googie in the city! </p>



<p>This one&#8217;s a must-visit for the experience alone.</p>
