										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Before we begin, we would just like to add that we understand how 2020 was a horrible year for humanity overall. All of us, to some degree or the other, struggled with our mental health during the COVID-19 Pandemic. But personal change in the smallest order practiced at the right place and the right time could potentially make us cope better.</p>



<p>Mindfulness and wellness became some of the biggest buzzwords in 2020, and mental health during COVID-19 became the center-point of many urgent conversations. The transformative power of mindfulness has gotten tons of people out of the rut since time immemorial. But this year, it&#8217;s been a different kind of difficult &#8211; an unfamiliar difficult.</p>



<p>Have you ever just found yourself assuming someone&#8217;s happy because their social media says so? Just because things seem to be going well for them?</p>



<p>Assuming people don&#8217;t have fears, issues, and their share of troubles is unfair. To you as well as the person you&#8217;re basing your assumptions about.</p>



<p>Wellness is when people allow themselves to focus on only those things that they can benefit from. And detach themselves from things that would otherwise hold them back.</p>



<p>Mindfulness is not an effort to eliminate fear, or block out all the shadows of your life. It&#8217;s a state of mind that allows you to be okay during happy times and the not-so-happy times.</p>



<p>Here are five powerful habits that can help you re-learn what you know about mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meditate.</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-in-depth#hed3" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">health benefits of meditation</a> are known far and wide. Yet, what most people skip mentioning is how meditation can help you know and understand yourself better.</p>

<p>Consider starting a meditation practice if you don&#8217;t already have one. The goal isn&#8217;t to become a monk overnight. Starting small is key!</p>



<p>Especially when you&#8217;re relearning ways to look after your mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even just a few minutes a day can have a profound impact on centering you. Mobile apps like <strong><a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a></strong> can also help make the process easier and sustainable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be present.</h2>



<p>Wellness is essentially making yourself feel grounded on a regular basis. A lot of us spend our energy thinking or worrying about tomorrow &#8211; the future. It&#8217;s good to make a mental reminder of statements like, <em>&#8220;all we have is today, and more specifically, the present moment.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Being fully present while eating, conversing with family and friends, at work meetings, can be highly rewarding. These are small ways to promote wellness from within.</p>



<p>Even when you find yourself struggling with your mental health — pandemic or not, being present with your emotions can allow you to focus on the <em>now.</em> And can **help you slow down to embrace what you&#8217;re feeling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be aware of how you feel.</h2>



<p>The first thing I taught myself, whenever I found myself struggling with my mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, was to recognize what I was feeling. Physically and emotionally.</p>



<p>This helped me try and understand the cause behind what I was feeling. Paying attention to your emotions at any given moment — <strong>is mindfulness</strong> — and you can reap long-term benefits from it.</p>

<p>Acknowledging your feelings can be especially helpful when you don&#8217;t feel good. When you notice yourself feeling angry or agitated, &#8220;check-in&#8221; with your body to understand why.</p>



<p>And instead of succumbing to anger and expressing yourself in a toxic manner, inculcate the process of acknowledging and addressing your emotions.</p>



<p>Allow yourself to <strong>feel</strong> angry.</p>



<p>You will then able to process what you&#8217;re feeling, identify the reasons behind it, and take necessary action that alleviates the anger. This is what we call wellness for the soul.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep a journal.</h2>



<p>Journaling is an excellent way of staying aware of what&#8217;s happening in your life and how you feel. It helps you get things off your chest, detach from negative energy, and see the bigger picture.</p>



<p>The best part is that journaling takes any shape and form you want it to. The sheer lack of structure helps you understand what your flow of emotions and thoughts really is. It&#8217;s your easiest ticket to wellness through mindful behavior.</p>

<p>Most people swear by writing three things they are grateful for before they go to bed. This is a practice known to make you feel better by highlighting the things you appreciate. Especially right before hitting snooze and ending your day.</p>



<p>While having a designated time for journaling is great, getting to it when you just need to vent out works just as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reduce social media pressure.</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s quite ironic when an app meant to increase connection can decrease how connected you can feel with your circle and yourself. Social media for many of us translates into instant gratification and approval. It can also be a waste of time.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7536964/">This study conducted by Peking University titled, *&#8221;Social Media Use and Mental Health during the COVID‐19 Pandemic&#8221;,</a>* underlines the negative effects social media can have on unsuspecting users.</p>



<p>Feelings of depression among their subjects were noted. The detrimental relationship between exposure to disaster news from social media and mental health during COVID-19 was also reported.</p>

<p>Being mindful when it comes to using and existing on social media can assist people in maintaining healthy relationships with their actual and virtual selves.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">And finally,</h2>



<p>All we would like to leave you with is that recovery is a completely subjective experience.</p>



<p>And everyone owes themselves the respect it requires to take up healing. Being mindful isn&#8217;t a magician&#8217;s trick. It can&#8217;t be learned overnight either.</p>



<p>It takes effort to ask yourself to be better every day. However, the fruits of this effort are the kind that keep you up and running for longer than anyone&#8217;s bet.</p>

<p>Before we begin, stop and take a deep breath. Straighten your spine and unclench your jaw. Yep, let&#8217;s begin. </p>



<p>2020 was the year of a lot of highs and many lows, but history will remember this year as the year of the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://combatcovid.hhs.gov/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=mmg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. (But also the year Trump left the White House after a single run <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/263a.png" alt="☺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). The response to the pandemic has been a difficult one globally.</p>



<p>The US alone averaged at extremely high rates of cases as well as the people we lost. Meanwhile, the world found itself amidst the climate change emergency as well.</p>



<p>However, recovery from this year wouldn&#8217;t just mean the introduction and availability of a vaccine. It would also mean policy changes. As well as a guided transition into a pandemic free world in conjunction with medical experts, scientists, and economists alike.</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s complex times, it becomes difficult to gauge the weight on the shoulders of an individual. Especially a young one, trying to make ends meet, provide for themselves and their family and navigate a pandemic. But recovery from this year wouldn&#8217;t just mean recovering from the pandemic. It would also need to mean individual recovery.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not promising that the following will aid the healing of all your wounds. But they might make your days a little better. So, maybe, give it a shot and see if some of them help.</p>

<p>Yep, taking note of the many small things that make life what it is, is a great way to feel gratitude. It also helps break the rut we find ourselves in every day.</p>



<p>Take a second to watch the lake you drive by. Take a picture of the bird that comes and sits on your balcony or the way the sunlight hits your kitchen counter. Nature should be the last thing we take for granted, as it&#8217;s the shortest route to any recovery.</p>

<p>Yep, you heard us right. We really think it&#8217;s time to let go of posting on social media as per highest traffic times, what gets more likes, etc. Because that rarely ever translates into sustained happiness.</p>



<p>Tell yourself your social media is for you, before anyone else. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you post something that others don&#8217;t like. Treat your social media as your memory album. It can be more, but only when that more pleases your being.</p>



<p>Not to sound cheesy but, nothing is ever too big or too small. Allow yourself to enjoy your scrolling. Fill your feed with people and content that make you feel good.</p>



<p>Checking your social media platforms shouldn’t be a chore for any of us! Help yourself by eliminating the immediate blockages to your healing process.</p>

<p>Recover from the pandemic by prepping your body for the day it is about to take on, with a glass of hot water (not boiling, of course). And your mind with things you are grateful for. Make a mental list of the things you&#8217;re grateful for — even if it&#8217;s just a couple. Then see how your mood changes for the better! (You can always get yourself a gratitude journal as well.)</p>



<p>And if your day ends up taking a turn you didn&#8217;t expect, coming back to your list will help. This is the recovery needed for your mind as well as the human flesh it supports.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don&#8217;t filter your tears or your laughter — that&#8217;s healing.</h2>

<p>If you feel something that hurts, and it makes you sob until snot bubbles form, embrace it. If you came across a hilarious joke that literally makes you want to howl, go ahead!</p>



<p>Don’t stunt your emotions; nobody can stop you from expressing yourself. Kneecapping your emotions can be a burden — but letting go is absolutely essential in your journey to healing and allowing yourself to just be!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tell yourself it&#8217;s okay you&#8217;re not a superhero.</h2>

<p>No one expects you to do <em>everything.</em></p>



<p>No one. Understand your limits and do yourself (and those close to you a favor) and avoid reaching burnout as much as possible.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t yet have that quarantine bod? Don&#8217;t have as much saved as your thought you would? Learn to note the progress you have made still, and how far you have come from the starting point. If you take a step back and can see that you’re in a better place than you once were, that’s all that matters.</p>

<p>Noting things down has an incomparable beauty in itself. And it is only human to forget the things we swore we wouldn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>Recovering from the pandemic will require active work on all our parts. And this is one of the most helpful ways of recognizing your feelings before you begin to process them.</p>



<p>Remembering every single thought we had is impossible. It really is. So do yourself a favor, and note it down. In whatever form you think is best.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take up the things you liked as a child.</h2>

<p>Sure we were all locked in this past year — but so many people took up childhood activities again! From puzzles, to painting, and making pillow forts. There&#8217;s a ton of activities people found comfort in this past year, in their own journey of recovering from the pandemic.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s so much we loved as kids and let go of as we grew older. Find those things again and yourself, through them! From making Christmas villages to taking pictures, to collecting bottle caps and making elaborate houses out of cards, go wild!</p>
