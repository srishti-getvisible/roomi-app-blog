<p>When choosing an apartment, you&#8217;ll come across just about everything. Modern, quirky, old, new, odd&#8230;and perfect. Out of all the different types of apartments, the two most likely to come up in your search are the 1-bedroom apartment and the studio apartment. Both have a lot in common, with their own distinct advantages and downfalls. Let&#8217;s examine studio vs. 1-bedroom apartments so you can decide on the right choice for you.</p>

<p>A studio apartment is designed as a single large room with all you need in one living area. It combines the living room, bedroom, and dining area in open floor space (with no adjoining walls between). That is aside from your bathroom, which is &#8211; thankfully &#8211; in a separate room.</p>



<p>A studio is an amazing choice for someone who wants to live alone, likes open, airy space, and is looking to save some money off the rent. Additionally, studio apartments don&#8217;t need a lot of furniture to feel complete. This makes them pretty perfect for someone who is just starting life on their own.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a fun fact. While the studio is essentially an open space, the storage space inside it is limited. Okay, maybe it&#8217;s not so fun, but if you&#8217;re someone with many belongings, you should keep an eye out for studios with larger storage spaces that can take your things.</p>



<p>Also, studio apartments are not ideal for most couples, especially if you need some privacy now and again.</p>

<p>A 1-bedroom apartment is carved out by walls into smaller rooms. Your bedroom is a separate room, rather than having a bed in the living space. The kitchen may also be its own room, but some 1-bedroom apartments have an open-plan kitchen and living area.</p>



<p>Generally, 1-bedroom apartments are typically more spacious. Do you like to have friends over, need some privacy or just think you&#8217;d go stir-crazy with only one room in the home? A 1-bedroom apartment will be better than a studio apartment for you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-studio-vs-1-bedroom-apartment-any-difference">A Studio vs 1 Bedroom Apartment: Any Difference?</h2>



<p>First, in comparing a studio vs 1 bedroom apartment, a defining difference is that the 1-bedroom has a separate bedroom area that is closed off from the living area and kitchen. On the other hand, a studio apartment is a self-contained space that houses everything in a single large room.</p>

<p>Beyond the wall partitions and space cordoning, there are several factors to consider when comparing a studio vs 1 bedroom apartment. Let&#8217;s break down all the important stuff.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: Getting a studio is cheaper than getting a 1-bedroom apartment because it has less space. You might find that a studio apartment helps you save a few hundred dollars, for a more manageable lifestyle.</li><li><strong>Utility bills</strong>: Again, more space means more utilities and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-amenities-when-renting-in-nyc/">amenities</a>. More utilities mean more bills for heating, lights, more electrical outlets, etc. You’re likely to incur more utility bills if you decide to stay in a 1-bedroom apartment instead of a studio.</li><li><strong>Cleaning and Decorating</strong>: It’s always going to be easier to clean an apartment with a smaller space. The same goes with decorating as there’ll be fewer walls to fill up.</li><li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: If you like to be on your own or with one other person you’re very comfortable around, a studio apartment might be enough. But if you like to have friends over for dinner, you may need a larger space, making a 1-bedroom apartment a better option.</li><li><strong>Occupancy</strong>: When more than one person occupies a studio apartment, it can feel cramped. A 1-bedroom apartment offers more in terms of space (both storage and general) and comfort for people.</li><li><strong>Remote work</strong>: If you work from home, you&#8217;ll probably find a studio apartment just doesn&#8217;t cut it. It&#8217;s not ideal to eat, sleep, work and relax in the same room every day. Especially when you have to do it all from your bed. Alternatively, a 1-bedroom apartment allows you room to move around and catch your breath.</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Whatever option you choose between the studio and a one-bedroom apartment, the location will affect the price. Even though studios are generally cheaper, you&#8217;ll save money on a one-bedroom apartment if you move away from the action.</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-right-for-you">So Which is Right for You?</h2>



<p>There’s no straight answer to this question. Whether you choose a studio apartment or a 1-bedroom apartment depends on what matters to you. Weigh up your personal preferences, budget and living expectations. Then, you can decide on which of the spaces fits your needs.</p>



<p>Whatever your preference is, the earlier you start your search, the better. Ready to find that suitable studio apartment or one-bedroom in minutes? Let <a href="http://roomiapp.com">Roomi</a> help you.</p>

<p>Living with your friend sounds like a dream … unless you’re planning on sharing a studio apartment. Can 2 people live in a studio apartment comfortably? See Roomi’s tips for sharing a small space!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sharing a Small Space with Your Friend</h2>



<p>Living with a roommate is not easy, even if they’re your friend. It involves a lot of adjustment, patience, and compromise. When you’re planning on sharing a studio apartment with a friend, it is important to set boundaries to ensure that you do not drive each other crazy. Staying organised, setting schedules, learning to respect boundaries and even getting privacy dividers …there are many innovative ways to make sharing a small space easier.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do you share limited space?</h2>



<p>Finding innovative ways to maximise limited spaces can help you live comfortably with your roommate, even in limited spaces. Looking for inspiration?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make the most of room dividers</h3>



<p>If you’re a fan of medieval dramas, you’ll be familiar with room dividers or privacy screens. They’re not just a fancy addition to a room &#8211; they can also help you demarcate specific areas in a small apartment. If you don’t want to invest in a room divider just yet, you can also strategically place rugs around the apartment to create cosy nooks!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Get creative with storage</h3>



<p>Finding enough storage space for one person is a feat in itself, but when you’re sharing a studio apartment with your friend, you need to get creative. Apart from the usual spaces, try to incorporate additional storage using hooks or buying multipurpose furniture.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stay organised</h3>



<p>When sharing a studio apartment, organisation is key. You cannot leave your things lying around as if you are living alone. And the best way to ensure that your roomie respects your space? Make sure that you are respecting theirs!</p>



<p>Pack away anything that you aren’t using, and try to reduce clutter as much as possible. Not only does this help your studio apartment seem more spacious, but it also helps you be a good roommate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can 2 people live in a studio?</h2>



<p>Disagreements are common, even when you’re living with your friends. When you’re sharing a small space, it is easy to get frustrated with the person you’re living with. So, how can you ensure that your co-living situation doesn’t turn into a nightmare?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Set your boundaries</h3>



<p>Before you live together, make sure that there are definite boundaries in place. Decide who is going to pay for the utilities and who is going to do the grocery shopping ahead of time. Plus, you&#8217;ll want to discuss the ground rules for things like having guests over. Make sure that these rules are agreed upon before you move in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Set a cleaning schedule</h3>



<p>No one likes to live in a messy environment. But when you’re sharing a studio apartment, things tend to pile up much quicker. It is best to set a cleaning schedule or spend a few minutes tidying up each day. Not only will this help to keep your apartment in good shape, but it can also help you bond with your friend.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shop for décor and furniture together</h3>



<p>Buying décor and furniture together can be a fun roommate bonding experience, and it will help you avoid any disagreement. While you may have a vision for the place you’re living in, your roommate might not agree with you. Whenever you’re buying something for the studio apartment, make sure that you consult your roomie.</p>

<p>No matter how hard your roomie tries to stay out of your way, finding alone time in a shared studio apartment is not easy. Hence, it’s best to get used to sharing a small space with your friend. Try to meet your friends outside of your apartment or go for a walk &#8211; an easy way to give yourself some space.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-have-a-wide-empty-floor-area-floor-plants-are-the-answer">Have a wide, empty floor area? Floor plants are the answer!</h2>



<p>So you don’t know what to do with the empty space in a room? Invest in a floor plant! Floor plants are an awesome addition to a room that’s a bit spacious, such as a living room. Plus, floor plants are a much cheaper alternative for filling an empty space as opposed to purchasing another piece of furniture.</p>



<p>Where on the floor does your pot go? Make sure your plant is placed near a window and has enough light. In addition, make sure that your floor plant’s dimensions make sense for the room that it’ll be in. Floor plants are bound to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/cheap-life-hacks-to-turn-your-new-apartment-into-a-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make any room feel a bit homier!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-have-a-green-thumb-invest-in-succulents-and-cacti">Don&#8217;t have a green thumb? Invest in succulents and cacti!</h2>



<p>Succulents and cacti are popular flora for those who don’t exactly have a green thumb. These plants have also become a sought-after decor trend. Invest in cute potted succulents or cacti if you want a pop of life on your desk or counter! Whether you&#8217;re limited on space or just love a vibrant display, creating a versatile setup with various plants can instantly transform your space. Consider checking out some of the popular <a href="https://www.bloomsybox.com/plants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potted plants collection</a> which offers an array of choices perfect for brightening any living area. This option provides convenience and allows you to select the ideal indoor plant that suits your taste and maintenance capabilities.</p>



<p></p>



<p>These plants are hearty and well-suited for areas in which other plants wouldn&#8217;t thrive.

Succulents and cacti can thrive anywhere, so there is no need to worry about finding the perfect spot for them!</p>

<p>Have a large, empty wall space in your small apartment that you don’t know what to do with? Make a wall of hanging plants! Wall plants are becoming a popular trend among plant lovers.</p>



<p>Pick your favorite wall plant or herb and put them in a small pot. Use a few wood screws to hold your plants into the wall and there you go!</p>



<p>If you’re someone who has a love for carpentry, you could even build shelves for your wall foliage. A great DIY project!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-have-an-apartment-suited-for-real-plants-go-the-artificial-route">Don&#8217;t have an apartment suited for real plants? Go the artificial route.</h2>



<p>If you don’t have the time for real foliage, go artificial! Artificial plants require no extra time and energy, so they’re perfect for anyone who’s on the go. Plus, they&#8217;ll last forever!</p>



<p>Add a pop of color to any room with an artificial plant of your choice. Fake plants are also a great option for people who want a plant aesthetic but have a small apartment that doesn&#8217;t offer enough natural light.</p>

<p>Studio apartment spaces feel cozy when you first see them, but the more you start filling it with your stuff, the smaller they seem to get. Roomi will help you with tips and tricks to make your small room look bigger and brighter! Before you resign yourself to life in a cramped space, first consider some reasons your studio could feel smaller than it used to:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The furnishings don&#8217;t go well with your apartment</li>



<li>Your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/is-your-roommate-a-slob-or-a-hoarder-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate is a hoarder</a></li>



<li>You haven&#8217;t organized your things properly</li>



<li>You haven&#8217;t read this blog before</li>
</ol>



<p>Fret not folks! This blog will help your small room look bigger with tips on right furnishings and how to organize them like a pro.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-low-seating-make-an-apartment-look-bigger">1. Low seating make an apartment look bigger</h2>



<p>Anything tall, like high-backed chairs and big lamps, doesn&#8217;t fit well in a small room because they take over too much space visually. Instead, try low slung pieces like low furniture and seating! This will make your ceilings appear higher that will ultimately make the small room look bigger and more spacious. We feel low seating gives an apartment a welcoming, laid-back vibe, too!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-be-wary-of-busy-prints">2. Be wary of busy prints</h2>



<p>Patterned rugs and furniture can brighten any space in a few seconds. However, they don&#8217;t make apartment look bigger as the space might seem small and congested. Stick to single accent pieces per room and solid bedsheets as opposed to the ones with patterns. These will help you make a small room look bigger.</p>

<p>Many patterns can make a room appear smaller and busy, but there&#8217;s one exception to the rule: stripes! Stripes make a small room look bigger, so while setting up your gorgeous studio apartment, opt for striped rugs or curtains to maximize a room&#8217;s visual space.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-storage-is-your-best-friend">5. Storage is your best friend</h2>



<p>Clutter is the mortal enemy of small rooms. A studio apartment has limited space so be very mindful while renting or buying furniture for your home.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-choose-the-color-of-your-furniture-wisely">6. Choose the color of your furniture wisely</h2>



<p>Another simple way to make your small room look bigger is to match the color of your furniture with the color of the walls. Too much contrast between the two gives an impression of clutter making any room seem smaller, and you&#8217;ll notice an instant improvement when you focus on improving the flow through a room.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-create-clever-divisions">7. Create clever divisions</h2>



<p>A small room is usually just space with no divisions whatsoever, so we end up looking at the kitchen, living area, and bedroom as one complete landscape. Clever divisions can help you to visually separate your bedroom from the rest of the apartment, and create that cozy studio apartment vibe that you see on Pinterest. Get room dividers, moveable bookshelves, a creative vertical garden, or even a clothing rack to create a fun visual division.</p>
