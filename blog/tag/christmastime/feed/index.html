Nowhere is better than New York City around Christmastime; from Macy’s window shopping to admiring the tree at Rockefeller Center, there’s no denying that NYC is the most magical place to be during Christmas. Lockdown or not, Christmas still came along. And so did the snow. It was solemn, maybe a little lonely. But we weren&#8217;t all alone. </p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-covid-essentials-to-keep-at-home-in-2020-roomi" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">With the pandemic still weighing heavily on our shoulders,</a> there’s been much speculation as to whether or not NYC Christmas festivities will still be happening this year.
