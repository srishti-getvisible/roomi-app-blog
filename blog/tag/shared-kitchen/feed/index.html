										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the most exciting things about moving to a new city or neighborhood are the restaurants you get to add to your must-try list. (Chances are there are a handful of mouthwatering places on your block alone.) But as much those dollar slices and falafels are calling your name, your wallet and waistline will take a major hit if you aren’t equipped to prepare some of your meals in your shared kitchen. That&#8217;s when you obsessively start looking up kitchen hacks and quick recipes and you end up here. </p>



<p>So, where do you go from here? While we’d all love to go on a massive shopping spree through William Sonoma, the moving process doesn’t leave much wiggle room in the budget for kitchen gadgets. So we checked in with the pros to see what they put on their list of must-haves when stocking a new kitchen. These essentials can mean the difference between an ever-growing takeout bill (and pant size) and delicious, homemade meals in minutes. Here are the first five things nutritionists buy when stocking a new shared kitchen, with our top picks for the splurge vs. steal. Grab a pot, some groceries and your roommate — it’s time to cook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Get a toaster oven for your shared kitchen</h2>



<p>So basic, and yet so useful, the&nbsp;toaster oven will become your new best friend on nights when your roommate decides to finally give that fancy 20-step Pinterest recipe a try (hogging all the pots and pans), or on days you get tied up at the office and just want to whip up an easy meal. In fact, some of the easiest <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi/">kitchen hacks</a> involve a toaster oven!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The kitchen gadgets that really count are those that get to take up the precious real estate on the countertops.. My first choice is a toaster oven. Unlike a toaster, with a toaster oven you can heat up items you might otherwise need to put in an oven (like a slice of pizza) or dinners in metal containers that you aren’t able to put in the microwave, and cook items to a delicious crispness (like roasted potatoes).&nbsp;You can make a quick meal for one by baking a chicken cutlet in the toaster oven — just place on a tray and add some seasoning, a drizzle of balsamic glaze and a drop of olive oil. Add to a salad and you’ll have a great, low calorie lunch or dinner.”</p><cite><a href="http://www.bonnietaubdix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bonnie Taub-Dix, RD</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:</strong>&nbsp;<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-TOB-40-Classic-Toaster-Broiler/dp/B004JMZGM2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler</a>, $79.95</span><br> <strong>Steal</strong>: Black &amp; Decker Black Toaster Oven, $29.99</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Food Processor</h2>



<p>Not only does it store easily in a small cabinet, but this handy gadget will majorly cut down on meal prep time. You can chop and mince ingredients in minutes. It&#8217;s one of the greatest kitchen hacks ever! Plus, think of all the smoothies you’ll be making in your shared kitchen!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“A must-have pick for my first kitchen was a small, countertop food processor — not a huge, expensive KitchenAid, but a tiny one that’s perfect for a super small apartment or studio. In fact, I still use my tiny processor all the time in my current kitchen, which is larger than my first&#8230; Having a food processor of any size is a must if you plan to make vegetables a regular part of your meal plan, which of course we all should! If you’re very short on space, it can even sub as a small blender (you can make smoothies in it!) and it’s great for making servings for one, so if you live on your own you don’t feel like you’re going to have large amounts of food waste.”</p><cite><a href="http://www.erinpalinski.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Erin Palinski-Wade, RD</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:&nbsp;</strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-DLC-10SY-Classic-7-Cup-Processor/dp/B01AXM4SB6/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Cuisinart+DFP-14BCN+Food+Processor&amp;qid=1618373987&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFWU0NYUFk5V0ZIMDYmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA3NzMyNzY2TE1HUFFaR0M5RjYmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDQxMjk2NTFSWjVGMjQ1QjFMSUUmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuisinart DFP14BCN Food Processor, 14 Cup</a>, $119.95&nbsp;<strong><br> Steal: </strong>Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus Food Processor, 3-Cup, $39.95</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Dutch oven is a must for your shared kitchen</h2>



<p>A Dutch oven is the perfect addition to a co-living household and those awesome potluck dinners you’re dying to have. But make sure to choose a vibrant color. So, the nest time you host friends for a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi/">dinner</a>, you can bring it right to the table! Save yourself a dirty dish. That&#8217;s one of the most useful kitchen hacks out there!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“One of my first, and most essential purchases, was my big 7-quart Dutch oven. It’s still a fixture in my kitchen, some 8 years later&#8230; As a graduate student, I used it to make all sorts of one-pot meals to get me through the week, like soups, stews, hearty pasta sauces, and curried chicken. It also doubles as a kitchen decor piece if you leave it out on the stove — I didn’t have enough cupboard space in my tiny studio to hide it away, anyway!”</p><cite><a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/johannah-sakimura-nutrition-sleuth/author/johannahsakimura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Johannah Sakimura, RD</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:</strong> <a href="https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/le-creuset-signature-oval-dutch-oven/" class="broken_link">Le Creuset Cast Iron 3.5-Qt. Wide Oval Dutch Oven</a>, $350</p>



<p><strong>Steal:</strong>&nbsp;Threshold Cast Iron Dutch Oven – 3 Qt., $29.99</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Blender</h2>



<p>No shared kitchen is complete without a blender. It’s the first item that <a href="http://www.francicohen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Franci Cohen</a>, certified nutritionist and personal trainer, stocks in a new kitchen. The appliance won’t take up precious real estate, and is essential to whipping up <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/nyc-gardening-hacks-herbs-to-grow-in-your-apartment/">smoothies</a>. And that&#8217;s a super easy way to up your fruit and veggie intake. Plus, If you’re one of those people who play whack-a-mole with their alarm clock every morning, your blender will ensure you have a filling and tasty breakfast to grab on the go – even when you have literally one minute to spare. You won&#8217;t need to search for kitchen hacks anymore after this purchase!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The night before, toss some Greek yogurt, skim milk, kale or spinach, banana, berries and almond butter in the blender bowl, cover and place in your fridge. In the morning, whip up your smoothie for a powerhouse breakfast loaded with vitamins, minerals, protein and calcium to keep you from visiting the vending machine before lunch.”</p><cite><strong><a href="http://www.bonnietaubdix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bonnie Taub-Dix, RD</a></strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>While smoothies may be the first thing that come to mind when reaching for the blender, that’s only scratching the surface.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Use it to make vegetable juices, soups, salad dressing and marinades for lean meat — even cocktails! You can also use it to create healthy white flour alternatives from healthy grains such as oats.”</p><cite><strong>Franci Cohen, RD</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ninja-BL660-Professional-Blender/dp/B00939FV8K/ref=sr_1_4?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444792364&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=blender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ninja Professional Blender</a>, $112.99<br> <strong>Steal:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-58148A-Multi-Function-Blender/dp/B00EI7DPI0/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444792364&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=blender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hamilton Beach Power Elite Multi-Function Blender</a>, $26.85</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Chef’s Knife</h2>



<p>You won’t get very far prepping a healthy meal without a good knife.   Sakimura counts as one of her most essential early purchases.&nbsp;If you go for the splurge and invest in a high-quality knife, Sakimura recommends getting it professionally sharpened once a year. Your shared kitchen will immediately feel like a professional kitchen with a good chef&#8217;s knife!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I bought an 8″ chef’s knife, which is a great all-purpose knife. I went with the Wusthof Classic Ikon because I loved the weight and clean design. Talk about a good investment! I still use it almost daily, eight years later, and it has held up beautifully, despite slicing more than its fair share of produce, including countless watermelons and butternut squashes (I’m a nutritionist after all!) I’m sure I should have it done more frequently, but it seems to hold up fine!”</p><cite> <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/johannah-sakimura-nutrition-sleuth/author/johannahsakimura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Johannah Sakimura, RD</a> </cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:</strong> Wüsthof Classic Ikon Chef’s Knives, $139.99-$199.95<br> <strong>Steal:</strong> Wüsthof Pro Chef’s Knife, 8″, $24.95</p>
