<p>When everything around us seems to be falling apart, a great way to cope is to resort to the mysteries and beauty of transience. Rivers and Tides &#8211; a documentary on the life and work of land artist, Andy Goldsworthy &#8211; paints the most beautiful picture of impermanence.</p>



<p>The director, Thomas Riedelsheimer follows Goldsworthy around in the wilderness as he creates magical outdoor sculptures and artworks using natural materials such as mud, wood, ice, stone, petals, twigs, and branches. The ephemeral nature of the art he creates is evident in the way it interacts with the environment and will give you a much-needed dose of nature.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Jane, 2017</h2>
