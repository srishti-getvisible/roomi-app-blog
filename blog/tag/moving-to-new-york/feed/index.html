<p>If you&#8217;re unsure where to start, don&#8217;t worry. Take a deep breath and look at these 8 tips and tricks on how to survive moving to NYC in 2024.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-use-an-online-tool-to-find-the-best-apartment">1. Use an online tool to find the best apartment</h3>



<p>To make moving to NYC much easier, you can use an online tool, like Roomi, to browse through available rooms or apartments in the city. Roomi is the best room and roommate finder with <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/brokers-fee-in-nyc-everything-you-need-to-know/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">no-fee apartments</a>, specialized filters and preferences to narrow down your search, extensive background checks and ID verifications, and 24/7 customer support.</p>

<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p>Source: <a href="https://roomiapp.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Roomi</a></p>



<p>Aside from the app&#8217;s safety features, Roomi makes searching for apartments easier. You can choose to show only ID-verified users, price, duration, apartment layout, what kind of property, the number of bedrooms, and amenities available.</p>



<p>And the best part? It&#8217;s totally free to get started.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pick your borough and neighborhood</h3>



<p>There are five boroughs in New York: Manhattan, <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/the-top-neighborhoods-to-live-in-brooklyn-for-young-professionals-in-2023/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/brooklyn-vs-queens/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Queens</a>, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Each of these boroughs has its own personality, so it&#8217;s best to visit each one of them before moving to get a feel of where you feel you&#8217;ll fit in best. You can go on a tour around the boroughs if you&#8217;ve never been at all to know more about the area and New York, in general.</p>



<p>After going through the boroughs and choosing one, it&#8217;s time to decide on which neighborhood you&#8217;re moving to. All boroughs are full of varying neighborhoods that can look and feel different although they&#8217;re just blocks away from each other. If you&#8217;re unsure how to choose, consider these factors:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How expensive/cheap is the housing?</li>



<li>How walkable is the neighborhood? Is it safe to walk around alone?</li>



<li>How is the commute to work/university going to be?</li>



<li>Are there open spaces like parks or green spaces to spend some free time in?</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Decide on the space that you need</h3>



<p>When moving places in general, it&#8217;s important to decide how much space you&#8217;ll need so you know what kind of place to look for. Here are some points to consider:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Will you work from home and need a space to work in?</li>



<li>Do you have a pet or are you planning to get one?</li>



<li>Are you thinking of having children anytime soon?</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Prepare your budget</h3>



<p>New York is an expensive city. Housing and cheap furniture can be difficult to find, owning a car isn&#8217;t advisable, and food prices are regularly increasing. This is why when planning your move to NYC, you have to plan and prepare your budget well.</p>

<p>And you don&#8217;t just consider housing, you have to include food, groceries, personal expenses, transportation expenses, moving supplies, moving fees, etc. Planning your budget to a T will help you estimate your expected overall expenses and save you from spending extra.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don’t be afraid to shop around when moving to NYC</h3>



<p>With all of the online shopping services today, you&#8217;re probably well-versed in checking multiple sites and price-checking different products, so it&#8217;s necessary to do the same when moving to NYC.</p>



<p>But &#8216;to shop around&#8217; means to look at multiple apartments, ask around for recommended moving companies (if you need them), read some reviews online, and walk around the area you want. Just make sure that, if you&#8217;re hiring any person or company to help you out, you hire someone who can do the work for the budget that you have.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Get all the information you can ahead of time</h3>



<p>Just like tip #5 above, it&#8217;s essential that once you have a list of potential movers or companies, do extensive research about them. Read reviews, look for bloggers who talked about moving and used the same companies, and ask friends and families for recommendations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Do everything you can possibly do before the movers to where you’re moving in NYC</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve sorted your things, moved everything to boxes, have hired movers, and you&#8217;re just a day or two away from finally moving to NYC, make sure that everything&#8217;s set before your movers arrive. By &#8216;everything&#8217;s set&#8217;, that means you&#8217;ve packed everything ready to go for the movers to quickly transport your stuff from your apartment to the truck.</p>



<p>Remember, even the most trustworthy movers can’t be superheroes. Movers come to do their job so make sure there is not still food in the fridge and you’re not in a robe. If movers charge hourly, save yourself money by making boxes easily accessible, big and heavy in the front, smalls in the back.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Find a roommate</h3>



<p>Living alone in an expensive city, like New York, isn&#8217;t practical due to the high cost of living. It&#8217;s ultimately better for your savings account to share expenses with a roommate. Not only can you save up on your finances, but you also gain a new friend.</p>

<p>The unending charm of New York has always been around, it seems. This city has seen it all and it continues to hold the title of &#8220;the city that never sleeps.&#8221; But if we were to introduce this city in one sentence, to someone who had (close to) no idea of what exactly New York was, we&#8217;d call it &#8216;the city of extremes.&#8217; And it quite frankly tops Los Angeles when it comes to existing in these extremes. There are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/09/the-top-billionaire-cities-in-the-world.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">more billionaires</a>&nbsp;in New York than anywhere else in the world, but at the same time,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/basic-facts-about-homelessness-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">upwards of 60,000</a>&nbsp;people sleep on the streets.

<p>When we look at New York geographically, it isn&#8217;t huge. If you&#8217;re moving here from any other city in the U.S., the transition might be overwhelming, given New York&#8217;s population density. More people live here than any other part of the U.S.;&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/planning-level/nyc-population/projections_briefing_booklet.pdf">8.7</a><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/planning-level/nyc-population/projections_briefing_booklet.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/planning-level/nyc-population/projections_briefing_booklet.pdf">million</a>&nbsp;to be precise. It&#8217;s also a vital hub for many industries today, from media to finance, and from real estate to tech.</p>



<p>Before making your mind up about moving to New York, here are some things you should know about the Big Apple!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New York is its stereotypes and more</h2>

<p>While there is an element of truth to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/living-in-nyc-5-common-myths-debunked-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the New York-ish stereotypes</a> that exist, like yeah we walk fast, are maybe rude and sometimes ruthlessly ambitious, the people you will find here are much more complex than what TV shows and movies have had all of us believe.</p>



<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be an exaggeration to say that&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/immigrants/downloads/pdf/moia_annual_report_2018_final.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost half of New York&#8217;s population</a>&nbsp;comprises of people who were born not just out of the city, but also out of the country.</p>

<p>Not all New Yorkers you meet will be unapproachable of course &#8211; on the most unsuspecting days you will find yourself getting help from the kindest of strangers. It&#8217;ll probably hit you when you least expect it, it in the form of clear directions or a door held open while you move your stroller or your groceries into your apartment building. For all of its rough edges, New York comes through in the most heart touching ways.</p>

<p>This of course isn&#8217;t true for everyone, but picking a neighbourhood can be a tough job for those that don&#8217;t show up with the homework done.</p>



<p>Before moving to New York City, and to enhance your chances of loving it, we recommend taking ample time to choose your neighborhood. Don&#8217;t make any decisions based on what you have heard of places &#8216;x&#8217; and &#8216;y&#8217;. Take your time understanding the many boroughs, what they stand for, and how they will affect the convenience in your life.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to know that change will forever be a constant here. Knowing the history of your area, and respecting it are also key to getting the most out of where you live. This is especially true if you find yourself moving to a particularly gentrifying place. While it is always preferred to look after our own economic interests, but this shouldn&#8217;t come at the expense of the history of the place you are moving into, and the respect of the people who have lived there for years.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re convinced you&#8217;re moving to New York City, we firmly suggest investing in multiple good walking shoes. Unless you&#8217;re one of those extremely lucky people who has a subway two steps away from both their commute stops, you can expect a considerable amount of walking.</p>



<p>But beyond that, exploring is something you should never stop doing in this city.

<p>Let me just put it this way: bars in New York are&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/faq/482/how-late-can-a-bar-or-club-stay-open" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">legally permitted</a>&nbsp;to open at 7 am and stay open until 4 am! Be sure to expect places that take advantage of that. You&#8217;ll always run across a bodega or a drugstore that&#8217;s open into the earliest hours of dawn. Don&#8217;t be surprised if you find other facilities like gyms, spas, and restaurants also open around the clock!</p>



<p>There&#8217;s just so much to this city, and this article doesn&#8217;t do it justice. The best thing about living here is that you are constantly faced with something new, something completely unsuspected, a new challenge to your expectation is thrown at least bi-weekly and you just have to be ready to explore it all.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s. So. Hot.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your sweat hisses when it hits the sidewalk in the heat of the summer. Pigeons lay in the shade at the parks. You’re pretty sure you just saw a cockroach wearing a straw hat, sunglasses, and a Hawaiian t-shirt carrying a miniature suitcase down into the sewers.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, that last bit may have been a heat-induced hallucination. But then again, it’s <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-tips-on-how-to-save-money-while-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a>. Anything could happen.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">And the worst part of it all? You&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s this hot.</span> All the hot tips on the internet tell you moving in the summer is a <em>bad idea</em>. But here you are..</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s enough to make a perfectly grown adult throw a temper tantrum, but that would involve way too much flailing around for these kinds of conditions. It’s an especially bad idea if your apartment has hardwood floors instead of carpets.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here are a few tips from the </span><a href="https://roomiapp.com" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roomi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team to stay cool when you find yourself moving when it’s hot.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Timing is everything</b> when you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An old bit of advice that still holds true today. And probably forever. Schedule moving for early in the morning or late in the evening when the heat is at its least miserable. If you have a choice between the two, always do it early.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, getting up early is a giant pain in the butt. But moving day almost never goes as planned. If things go awry, but you got an early start, you’ll have more time to fix it. Also, the</span><a href="http://www.almanac.com/fact/what-is-the-hottest-time-of-dayr" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">hottest point in the day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is typically 3 pm, not noon. So you’ve got more cool hours to work with early in the morning that don’t involve stumbling around narrow metal staircases in the dark. Farmers get up at the crack of dawn for a good reason, as it turns out.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Hydrat</b>ion is key if you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot </h2>



<p>One of the best tips we can give you for moving in the heat of the summer  is this: <strong>hydration is extremely important</strong>. <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of different opinions on how much water you should drink in a day. There isn’t a hard and fast rule that everyone can agree on. But according to</span><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this popular article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the fluid intake for guys is about 3 liters per day and gals is around 2.2 liters per day. The word fluid didn’t slip in by accident. Lots of beverages contain water and can count towards your hydration efforts. But keep in mind that moving is tough, sweaty work and you’re doing it in conditions that would make a camel wince. So it’s a good idea to drink extra beverages if you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And by the way, slamming a six pack of Bud Light then wrestling a couch up a flight of stairs is so not a good idea. So don’t let anyone on your moving team get too crazy with their interpretation of “beverages.”</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Use utilities to your advantage.</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wherever you’re moving to, have the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommates-split-utilities/">utilities</a> turned on and ready to go before you get there. If you’ve got an AC at the new place, the apartment can be cool as you move in. You might be tempted to save some money and turn off the utilities at your current residence on move out day. Understandable. But if you can keep them going for one more day, you can run the AC at your place while you pack. Even if you don’t have AC, you can run fans. And more importantly, the fridge (you&#8217;re fridge will be your life saver if you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot). Which brings us to our final piece of advice.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Cool, damp towels are your new best friend.</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cold, damp towel that’s been hanging out in the fridge can feel like pure ecstasy after a long day of moving when it&#8217;s hot. Maybe you can </span>even <span style="font-weight: 400;">stick it under a hat, so it covers your head and hangs down over the back of your neck through t</span>he day<span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don’t have power to the fridge, then cool water will still work wonders.</span></p>
