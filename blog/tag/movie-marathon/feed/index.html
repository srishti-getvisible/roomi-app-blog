<p>If you’ve ever wandered into the fandom section of the internet then you know that it is intense. The inside jokes, references, costumes, and games look like so much fun and are such a great way to find a community for yourself. There is this bond between the members of any fandom that the devil himself could not break.This is why a movie marathon makes for the perfect roommate bonding activity. It also helps that staying in and watching movies with your roommates is the perfect way to enjoy weekends during the cozy winters.</p>



<p>So, for those of you who want to dip your toes into the world of pop-culture with your friends (or those of you who just want to do some roommate bonding)- this one is for you. We’ve compiled for you a list of the 10 ideas for a great movie marathon to watch with your roommates and enjoy the cozy winters!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Greatest movie marathon of all-time- Star Wars</strong></h2>



<p>Of course, we have to begin with Star Wars. Any film nerd will tell you that the Star Wars series is an absolute must-watch for everyone. Get your roommates together during the cozy winters and put on Stars Wars Episode IV – A New Hope. AND YES THIS IS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE STAR WARS MOVIE TO START A MARATHON WITH. Now that that is out of the way, you and your roommates can sit back and be transported to a galaxy far far away (you know we had to make at least one reference!). For more info on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/tv/news/star-wars/147767-star-wars-machete-best-movie-viewing-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what order to watch the films in check this out.</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. For the movie buffs- <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, don’t freak out- I know doing a movie marathon of LOTR seems like a daunting task- don’t even get us started on the Director’s Cut- but believe me, it’s worth it. It’s mentally/physically taxing to watch this one so maybe pick a long weekend to watch this one. But believe me, it is the perfect way to spend cozy winters! Just sit back and wait and you and your roommates are transported to beautiful Middle Earth!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. For the millenials- <strong>Harry Potter</strong></h2>



<p>We would be surprised if you and your roommates hadn’t already watched all of the Harry Potter movies. But it’s such a fun franchise to revisit that it’s always got a place on Movie Marathon lists. Plus, you and your roommates can take the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/discover-your-hogwarts-house-on-wizarding-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pottermore test</a> to figure out which house you belong to.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. For the classy- <strong>James Bond</strong></h2>



<p>Oh la la, now we’re going to class it up a little! James Bond is an extremely fun movie franchise to watch with roommates because you get to debate about who the best James Bond is. Not to mention, you can even pour yourself a little Martini (Shaken, not stirred of course). Nothing like drinking with your roomis to make your winter even cozier. Call it roommate bonding with Bond! Here is a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.techradar.com/in/how-to/how-to-watch-the-james-bond-movies-in-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helpful guide about the order in which to watch them.</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. For the thrill junkies- <strong>Jurassic Park</strong></h2>



<p>Jurassic Park has been the most exciting, and terrifying, series since the first one came out in 1993. There’s a reason it’s one of the most successful movie franchises of all time. So, get your roommates, dim down the lights and start the marathon. Nothing will bond you and your roommates more than being scared together! So, get ready for an intense movie marathon.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. For the intellectuals- <strong>The Matrix</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, the Wachowskis are cinematic geniuses and no one can convince me otherwise. The Matrix trilogy is one of the all-time greatest movies, no questions about it. If you or your roommates haven’t watched this already, then you need to get on it ASAP. This is the best way to spend your cozy winters, by being intellectually challenged. You will have some of the most interesting conversations with your roommates after finishing this trilogy. This will definitely take your roommate bonding experience to a whole different level!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. For the action fans- <strong>Mad Max</strong></h2>



<p>Mad Max is one of those franchises that although is pretty successful, not many people have actually watched it in its entirety. And it’s time to change that. It’s got incredible action sequences and brilliant performances from the cast. It’s one of the most riveting dystopian movie franchises of all time and is PERFECT for the cozy winters. Buckle in and get ready for a thrilling movie marathon.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. For the laughs- <strong>The Hangover</strong></h2>



<p>You know what they say- laughter is the best medicine- even if the disease is the crushing winters. Everyone needs a good laugh every now and then and The Hangover films deliver just that. You and your roommates are in for a treat and who knows, maybe y’all will form a bond like Phil, Alan and Stu (but hopefully more happy).</p>
