<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability</h3>



<p>Hialeah has an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.walkscore.com/FL/Hialeah" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">average walk score of 69,</a>&nbsp;with the most walkable neighborhoods being Palmetto I-75 Industrial Center, Seminola City, and Trojan Park.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Roads/traffic</h3>



<p>On average, a one-way commute in Hialeah takes about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bestplaces.net/transportation/city/florida/hialeah" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">25.7 minutes,</a>&nbsp;which is slightly shorter than the national average. Most commuters (about 78.1%) prefer to drive, and only 2% opt for public transit.</p>



<p>Rush hour is between 4 PM to 6 PM. Unless you need to be on the road, most residents try to avoid going out during this time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis</h3>



<p>Numerous taxi services are available in Hialeah, including Uber and Lyft. Fares start from $2.50, with an additional $1.50 for every additional mile. Waiting fees are $24 per hour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public transportation</h3>



<p>The Hialeah Transit System provides two bus routes in the city: the Flamingo Route and the Marlin Route. The bus lines run from 6 AM to 7:30 PM from Monday to Friday, and from 9 AM to 3:30 PM on Saturday. Buses do not operate on Sunday and have reduced hours during holidays.</p>

If you’re new to the city, however, joining biking groups can be a great way to make new friends. You’ll easily find several active groups that explore the various trails in the city and always welcome new members. Hialeah is dedicated to improving safety for bicyclists on the road, but it still has a long way to go.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Restaurants</h2>



<p>While there are plenty of fast-food chains around, it is the family-owned businesses that make Hialeah’s food scene unique. Not only can you find authentic Cuban cuisine anywhere, but you also become family when you pop into any of these businesses.</p>
