<p>Asheville is a city in, and the county seat of, Buncombe County, North Carolina, United States. It&#8217;s located at the confluence of the French Broad and Swannanoa rivers. And it&#8217;s also the largest city in Western North Carolina and the state&#8217;s 12th most populous city.</p>



<p>Asheville has a humid subtropical climate, resembling the rest of the Piedmont region of the southeastern U.S., but with noticeably cooler temperatures due to the higher elevation.</p>

<p><strong>Lakeview Park</strong></p>



<p>Many different areas of Asheville have gone through cycles of growth, decline, and then re-growth. But North Asheville has been resilient. This part of the city is known to be affluent and also residential. Lakeview Park is also home to tranquil Beaver Lake, popular for fishing, boating, and paddleboarding. Lakeside paths draw joggers and dog walkers. As well as a boardwalk nature trail loops through peaceful wetlands in Beaver Lake Bird Sanctuary. The neighborhood’s winding streets also showcase homes in a mix of architectural styles, including Tudor Revival and Cape Cod!</p>



<p><strong>Town of Biltmore Forest</strong></p>



<p>This premiere community adjacent to the infamous <strong><a href="https://www.biltmore.com/our-story/the-vanderbilt-family/">George Vanderbilt’s castle</a></strong> was developed in the 1920s. It was initially meant for people who weren’t as rich as Vanderbilts to build McMansions. Biltmore Forest is your traditional old-money neighborhood. Surprisingly yet interestingly so, the neighborhood doesn’t have any gates or guardhouses!</p>



<p><strong>Asheville Downtown</strong></p>



<p>With beautiful Art Deco architecture, a vibrant nightlife and lots of eateries, Asheville’s downtown is growing in popularity as a place to live, especially with the emergence of new condos.</p>



<p>With the renaissance of Asheville well underway, downtown residents enjoy the convenience of walking to great restaurants, live music, special events, and shopping. If you&#8217;re looking for a room to rent in Asheville, in a neighborhood that is young and lively, Downtown is the place to be!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Roads and traffic in Asheville</h3>

<p>Feel like entering Asheville via road? Don&#8217;t miss out on the views at the Blue Ridge Parkway &#8211; considered the nation&#8217;s most scenic highway. The 469-mile Blue Ridge Parkway winds along the Blue Ridge Mountains, through Asheville, and into the entrance of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. There are several overlooks, roadside exhibits and hiking trails that make a trip along the Parkway a delight year-round. The Parkway intersects with Asheville at four points: US 25, US 70, US 74, and NC 191.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Taxis in Asheville</h3>



<p>Cabs are easily available in Asheville, with popular ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft operating within the greater Asheville area. The rideshare pick-up area is located past the north end of the airport terminal of the Asheville Regional Airport (AVL).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Public transportation in Asheville</h3>



<p>Asheville offers public transit through the <strong><a href="https://www.ashevillenc.gov/department/transit/">ART (Asheville Rides Transit)</a></strong> bus service that operates across the city and to the town of Black Mountain. Routes originate from a central station located at 49 Coxe Avenue.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Airports in Asheville</h3>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flyavl.com/">Asheville Regional Airport (AVL)</a>&nbsp;serves more than one million&nbsp;passengers per year. It offers non-stop flights and easy connections through the major US hubs of the following airports:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Atlanta (ATL)</li><li>Newark (EWR)</li><li>Chicago (ORD)</li><li>LaGuardia (LGA)</li><li>Washington, D.C./Baltimore (BWI)</li><li>Charlotte (CLT)</li></ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blue Ridge Parkway</h3>



<p>Although the&nbsp;Blue Ridge Parkway&nbsp;is known as “America’s Favorite Drive,” it’s also a favorite route among cyclists. The section of the Parkway that wraps around Asheville is fairly flat (outside of one strenuous climb of 3,000 feet), making it a great ride for both experts and beginners.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Riverside Drive</h3>



<p>Riverside Drive features a bike lane for road cyclists and is a great option for a flat ride along the French Broad River without going too far outside of&nbsp;downtown Asheville.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Restaurants in Asheville</h2>



<p>Asheville’s creative vibe and collaborative spirit have fueled the rapid growth of a thriving, eclectic restaurant scene. The small mountain city has a remarkably large pool of talented chefs who source inspiration from the city itself. But that&#8217;s not all!</p>



<p>Most of the restaurants in Asheville source much of their fresh ingredients from Western North Carolina’s tight-knit network of innovative farmers, foragers, and food artisans. Appalachian fare, Southern comfort food, and whole-hog barbecue mingle with flavors from Asia, Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and beyond, making for a riot of restaurant choices at mealtime.</p>



<p>Here are some of our favorite restaurants in Asheville:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Historical spots in Asheville</h2>



<p>Some of the most famous historical spots include the affluent Montford Area Historic District. This historic area features distinctive Queen Anne, Arts and Crafts, and Colonial Revival houses, many now restored as B&amp;Bs. Each summer, the Montford Park Players bring crowds to Hazel Robinson Amphitheatre for the outdoor Shakespeare Festival. Authors Thomas Wolfe and O. Henry are among those buried in the sprawling Riverside Cemetery, which has flower gardens and statue-topped mausoleums.</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s the Biltmore Estate — which is a historic house museum and tourist attraction in Asheville, North Carolina.
