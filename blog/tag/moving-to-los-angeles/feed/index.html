										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2020 Jacob and his friend rented a studio apartment somewhere in Los Angeles. When the lease ended in 2021, Jacob and his friend waited for his landlord to communicate the additional amount they now needed to pay to stay in the same apartment. But they never heard about the rent increase from the landlord.</p>



<p>If you’re a tenant in L.A. and wondering if there will be a rent hike at the end of your lease period, know that landlords in L.A. are now prohibited from raising the cost of more than 650,000 rent stabilizes units citywide. If you live in Los Angeles, know that there will be <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2022-01-03/even-in-hot-market-most-l-a-tenants-wont-face-rent-increases-for-at-least-another-year" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">no rent hikes for L.A. tenants until 2023</a> and possibly beyond. That&#8217;s not all. Los Angeles has important complex tenant laws. Knowing them well before moving into the city can help you save money on rent. Read on to learn about rent control in Los Angeles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-rent-control-laws-in-los-angeles">What are rent control laws in Los Angeles?</h2>



<p>In Los Angeles, the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) is a law that restricts the rent amount a landlord can charge from a tenant. It also limits the reasons for eviction. The law is enforced by the Rent Stabilization Board (RSB) of Los Angeles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-do-you-need-to-know-about-rent-stabilization-in-los-angeles">What do you need to know about rent stabilization in Los Angeles?</h2>



<p>A rental unit in Los Angeles might be subject to the <strong><a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/los_angeles/latest/lamc/0-0-0-195151" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">city’s Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO)</a></strong>, which protects tenants from unfair rent hikes and evictions provided the unit is built on or before October 1, 1978.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-rent-control-work">How does rent control work?</h2>



<p>Rental control in Los Angeles means a cap on the annual rental increase on units. So if you’re a renter in L.A., you can usually expect a rent rise between 3 and 8 percent annually.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-things-you-should-know-about-rent-controlled-apartments-in-los-angeles">Key things you should know about rent-controlled apartments in Los Angeles</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Landlords need to give at least 30 days&#8217; notice before a rent increase.</li><li>Tenants can expect a 1% increase in rent every year for all the utilities that the landlord pays.</li><li>Landlords cannot increase the rent more than once every 12 months.</li><li>If the rent increases, landlords are free to raise the security deposit</li><li>If you’re going to have an additional roommate who was not on the original lease, the landlord may raise the rent by 10%. But if a roommate who was initially in the lease moves out, the landlord needs to reduce the rent by the same amount.</li><li>The landlord is bound to pay relocation assistance for no-fault eviction where the tenants have no fault. The amount may range from $8,500 to $21,200. The exact amount depends on the reason for eviction, the tenant’s income, and the duration of the tenancy.</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-areas-in-los-angeles-have-rent-control">What areas in Los Angeles have rent control</h2>



<p>The law covers Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Inglewood, West Hollywood, and some unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-your-apartment-falls-under-the-rent-increase-law-in-los-angeles">Is your apartment falls under the rent increase law in Los Angeles</h2>



<p>If you live in a unit built before October 1, 1978, it is covered by RSO. Mobile homes in parks are also covered under this act. To know when your apartment was built and if it’s covered under the rent control in Los Angeles, check with the <a href="http://zimas.lacity.org/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">city’s property database</a>. You can find the information with just a few clicks. Know that even if your building meets all the specifications, it might be prevented from being covered by the RSO. This may happen under certain instances:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The unit is a government-funded property.</li><li>It is a luxury apartment.</li><li>The unit was completed after 1978</li><li>You live in a single-family home, and it’s the only building on the property</li><li>Hotel and motel rooms occupied for less than 30 days</li><li>Commercial buildings that were converted to residential buildings after October 1, 1978</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="do-rent-control-laws-in-los-angeles-allow-eviction">Do rent control laws in Los Angeles allow eviction?</h2>



<p>While living in rent-controlled apartments gives protection to a certain extent to tenants, however, you can still be evicted. Under rent control in Los Angeles, evictions are allowed in the following situations:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Creating a nuisance</li><li>Subletting the unit to someone else illegally</li><li>Causing damage to the property</li><li>Not paying rent</li><li>Not obeying the rental agreement</li><li>Using the rented property for illegal activities</li><li>Failure to provide the landlord with reasonable access to the property</li></ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="benefits-of-staying-in-a-rent-controlled-apartment-in-l-a">Benefits of staying in a rent-controlled apartment in L.A</h2>



<p>Apart from protection against unjustified eviction or increased rent, you may receive 1% interest per year on your security deposit if you live in a rent-controlled unit for at least a year.</p>



<p>You can also file a complaint if you find your apartment is in an inhabitable condition or if there is an overcharge of rent. In such a scenario, you will be entitled to the reduced rent.</p>



<p>If the building is inhabitable and the landlord doesn’t rehabilitate it, the city can take over the building in rare extreme cases. You’re also eligible for reduced rent, and the city will restore the apartment to a livable condition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rent-control-in-los-angeles-amidst-covid-19">Rent control in Los Angeles amidst COVID-19</h2>



<p>While landlords generally raise rents between 3-8 % annually, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has changed the scenario. After the 2020 pandemic, the mayor’s emergency order mentions that no landlords can increase the rent. However, they can charge a new rent once the tenant vacates and the new tenant moves in. This has been a historic decision, marking the first time in more than four decades under the rent control law in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>However, even with the rent freeze, many tenants in L.A. have suffered significantly in the last two years. While a handful of the white-collar employees have managed to work from home, the scenario is entirely different for the lower-income workers – especially in the hospitality and leisure industry. While the low-income tenants are eligible for rental assistance for $5.2 billion in federal funding to pay previously owed and future rent, there remains a high demand for assistance.</p>

<p>Los Angeles is the choice destination of many in California. The City of Angels is a melting pot of culture, attracting a diverse range of people from all over the world. It&#8217;s also the entertainment capital of the world, with Hollywood at its heart, and houses about 4 million people in total.</p>



<p>When you consider its good weather, scenery, and the numerous opportunities it offers, it&#8217;s easy to see why many dream of living in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>However, before moving to Los Angeles, there are a few things that you need to know about the city. Read on to explore ten key things about living in LA to help you make the most of your stay.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Most places have four different seasons. But in Los Angeles, it’s either the wet or dry season. The wet season runs from November to March and the dry season from April to October. August is the hottest month with an average high of 85 degrees. On the flip side, December is the coldest with an average overnight temperature of 48.</p>



<p>Because of the warm climate, it never <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/things-to-know-winter-in-los-angeles/">snows in Los Angeles</a>. Plus, there are plenty of sunny days to top up your tan at one of the amazing beaches in the area. What could be better?</p>

<p>Talk about taking a culinary adventure. If you’re planning on living in LA, then prepare for some mouth-watering escapades in the many restaurants dotted throughout the city.</p>



<p>And it isn’t just the food. The nightlife too is great too! Expect lots of jazz clubs, brewhouses and cocktail bars &#8211; some of which are open until 2 am for late-night revellers.</p>

<p>As one of the busiest cities in the US, Los Angeles does suffer from air pollution.

<p>Ride-sharing apps have become popular around the world. And if you&#8217;re living in LA, you&#8217;re most likely familiar with Uber or Lyft. This is because roads can get very crowded and busy in Los Angeles, and most people don&#8217;t like the stress of driving. If you&#8217;re one of those people, then you want to know whether it&#8217;s better to use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles. These apps have similar features regarding their prices, mobile application usage, and safety measures. However, they do bear a few significant differences. Let&#8217;s find out what they are.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="let-s-talk-about-these-apps">Let&#8217;s talk about these apps</h2>



<p>Uber first started in 2008, through the initiative of Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick. The aim of the company was to reduce the cost of direct transportation. Since its inception, Uber has grown in its services and is available in over 900 metropolitan areas.</p>



<p>Founded in 2012, Lyft was adopted from a company known as Zimride. Lyft now operates in all 50 states in the US.</p>



<p>Uber first started out as a luxury car service. According to reviews by drivers, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Uber-and-Lyft-1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">more business people tend to use this service</a>. Lyft, on the other hand, has been described as being a more <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-general-which-is-more-trustworthy-Uber-or-Lyft" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">customer-oriented and engaging service.</a></p>



<p>That being said, let&#8217;s dive right into whether you should use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-is-uber-cheaper-than-lyft">Pricing: Is Uber cheaper than Lyft?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re living in Los Angeles, you&#8217;ve probably wondered, &#8216;Is Uber cheaper than Lyft?&#8217; These two ride-hailing apps are popular in LA, but most potential riders would prefer the cheaper option. Typically, pricing for both apps depends on demand and traffic at the requested time. Fees such as minimum fare, duration rate, booking fee, surge pricing, and more are charged by both Uber and Lyft. This means that in the aspect of pricing, Uber and Lyft don&#8217;t bear much difference.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="uber-s-unique-riders-feature">Uber&#8217;s Unique Riders&#8217; Feature</h2>



<p>The Uber and Lyft mobile apps let you see the driver&#8217;s picture before pickup, so it&#8217;s easy for you to identify that it&#8217;s the right driver.</p>



<p>Some riders prefer peace and quiet during rides, and it may be awkward if their driver is the talking type. This is why Uber has provided a feature that lets the driver know you don&#8217;t want to talk ahead of time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="booking-rides">Booking Rides</h2>



<p>If you want to choose between Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles, you&#8217;re probably looking for which one has better rides. Unlike taxis in LA, there are a lot of ride options to choose from for each ride-sharing app. However, in terms of variety, Uber tops the list. It has 13 primary services, with the most popular ones being UberX, Uber Pool, and Uber Comfort.</p>



<p>Though Lyft provides rental cars on the app, Uber wins this round as it shines in terms of its extensive services. Uber has more eco-friendly and luxury ride options than Lyft does. For example, Uber Green is a sustainable ride option that lets you request a ride in an electric or hybrid car. With UberLUX, you can request a high-end luxury sedan and ride in style.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="safety">Safety</h2>



<p>Some reviews have shown that there have been cases of safety problems for both companies. Several security measures have been put in place by both apps, such as sharing your location with a third party, viewing the driver, and vetting drivers thoroughly. However, Lyft, unlike Uber, has put in place a compulsory safety education program for its drivers. They also run annual background checks on their drivers. So, if you&#8217;re living in Los Angeles, Lyft is probably the safer option for you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="customer-service">Customer Service</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re wondering whether to use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles, then you&#8217;ll want to consider how good their customer service is. Uber and Lyft both provide customer service communication options in the form of emails, contact forms, FAQs, and webchat. There are also customer service representatives on standby for users to address issues.</p>



<p>However, comparing <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.uber.com?aspects=customer+service&amp;stars=5" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">riders&#8217; reviews</a> on customer service for both companies, Uber has the upper hand.</p>



<p>One Uber rider said, &#8220;Customer-oriented company. Thanks for your customer service.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another stated, &#8220;I recently made a complaint about an Uber driver for the first time and just wanted to note how pleased I am with the&nbsp;<em>customer</em>&nbsp;<em>service</em>&nbsp;team who responded immediately not only by email but also telephoned me to enquire further and apologize. You never think anyone takes note of these things especially complaints but this was handled perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ease-of-use">Ease of Use</h2>



<p>Both Uber and Lyft have mobile apps, and it&#8217;s easy for users to set up accounts and request rides. The apps let you choose your current location, destination, and also allow you to track your driver&#8217;s movements as they head to your location.</p>



<p>Lyft goes a step further and allows customers to sign up on a desktop web browser. They both have sleek, modern designs and are simple to navigate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="subscription-plans">Subscription Plans</h2>



<p>Uber and Lyft care for their customers and have put in place distinct subscription plans to honor their most frequent riders.</p>



<p>Uber&#8217;s special plan is called Uber Pass and grants users airport pickups, free Uber Eats deliveries on certain orders, a 10% reduction on certain premium rides, and more, for $25 a month.</p>



<p>Lyft, on the other hand, dubbed its subscription plan Lyft Pink. For $19.99 a month, users get perks like free scooter rentals, unlimited bike rentals, a 15% discount on all rides, and more.</p>

<p>Transportation in LA might not be a breeze, but apps like Uber and Lyft help to make things easier. People are different, and while some may prefer Uber over Lyft and vice versa, they are both great ride-sharing apps with different features that make riding easy.</p>



<p>So, should you use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles? If safety is more important to you, choose Lyft. If having more options available is important, choose Uber. But if you&#8217;re looking for the best deal, use both as the pricing fluctuates between the two and you can find a cheaper ride by keeping your options open.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles weather overall is uncharacteristically warm because of its sub-tropical climatic conditions. What does that mean for you? If you were moving to LA in the summer, you might’ve had to deal with super-hot temperatures sometimes touching 100°F. That, coupled with the sweat from moving boxes would’ve put you in a very sticky situation (literally)! But luckily for you, sub-tropical climate = mild winter in Los Angeles! Even December, which is the coldest month in Los Angeles, experiences an average low of about 48°F.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-it-can-still-get-warm-in-winter">2. It Can Still Get Warm in Winter</h2>



<p>The winter in Los Angeles lasts from December to March and although it’s usually kind of mild, it can also get very hot because of the Santa Ana wind. Bringing in hot, dry weather, the Los Angeles weather can even go as high as 86°F on the days that this wind blows over the city. Be careful if you live near wooded areas, because these hot winds have been known to trigger fires.</p>

<p>Because of the mild climate experienced in winter in Los Angeles, it’s a top destination for tourists from all over the world! You can expect thronging crowds in all parts of the city, but more so in particular areas that have tourist attractions set up. We’ll explore these attractions some more later in the blog &#8211; there’s something for everyone!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-preparation-for-every-weather-is-key">4. Preparation For Every Weather is Key</h2>



<p>Even though the weather is generally mild and sunny, you can experience some bouts of terrible weather. And by this, we mean heavy rains that could dampen whatever plans you had that day. A coat to keep you warm and dry, and a cup of something hot, should be enough to get you through!</p>

<p>Moving to the city just before winter in Los Angeles? You&#8217;re in luck! Winter is a perfect time to get outdoors and explore the city.</p>



<p>Here are a few things to do while you enjoy the Los Angeles winter weather:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Hike up to Hollywood</strong>: What better way to enjoy the lovely weather than by going on a hike up to the Hollywood Hills? Winter is off season for hikers, so you’ll enjoy a relatively uncrowded trail! The view of the landscape from the top, especially during sunsets, is something to definitely watch out for.</li><li><strong>Visit theme parks</strong>: There are three major theme parks you can enjoy during the winter season. If you’re travelling with a family, you’ve got Disneyland. If you’re the adventurous type, then Six Flags Magic Mountain has a whole bunch of rides for you! And lastly, if you’re in the city of Hollywood, you should definitely go to Universal Studios for the movie-themed rides. Keep in mind that Thanksgiving and Christmas can get busy, but if you can deal with crowds, you’ll get a special treat alongside that fuzzy, holiday feeling!</li><li><strong>Visit the zoo</strong>: The Los Angeles Zoo is one that is renowned all over the world. For three months every year, from November to January, you can experience a magical winter at the zoo. Decorated all Christmassy with lights and animal sculptures, it’s definitely a treat for the senses! The coldest month in Los Angeles will be just a little cozier when you&#8217;re surrounded by families and the warmth of the festive spirit!</li></ul>

<p>Just because it’s going to be mild-weathered during winter, doesn’t mean you can’t visit places around LA to enjoy the holiday spirit! Here’s a short list of places you can hit up:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Pinos</strong> &#8211; Mount Pinos gets several inches of snow every year and is ideal for you if you enjoy snowshoeing and skiing.</li><li><strong>Snow Valley Mountain Resort</strong> &#8211; About an hour away from LA, this resort is a top skiing destination. Less explored than other popular spots, you can enjoy a variety of ski slopes.</li><li><strong>Palm Springs</strong> &#8211; Even during the hot winds of winter, Palm Springs makes a great getaway if you want mild hiking weather. You can also go camping, hiking or fishing!</li><li><strong>Los Angeles Beaches</strong> &#8211; Beaches are a hot destination during the summer months but they&#8217;re perfect for a quiet escape during winter. With few tourists and locals, you can take full advantage of the space!</li><li><strong>Descanso Gardens</strong> &#8211; Visit these beautiful gardens for a unique light display during Christmas! You&#8217;ll also be closer to nature and may sight some lovely birds and mammals.</li></ul>

<p>Got some questions about subletting? Subletting is a term that describes an individual allowing someone to rent all or part of a currently leased house or apartment. You can sublet your apartment if you&#8217;re going away for an extended period, or if you want to completely move out before the lease is up, for example. Subletting in Los Angeles, California is not a smooth ride, and you could come into tons of issues if you don&#8217;t comply with the subletting laws. If you want to find out how to sublet in Los Angeles, then cozy up with this Roomi blog and we&#8217;ll explain all!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-carefully-read-through-your-lease">1. Carefully read through your lease</h2>

<p>This first step is very important because your entire plan of action depends on it. Before you go ahead and sublet your apartment, you have to be certain that your lease permits you to. According to <a href="https://legalbeagle.com/13724419-california-sublet-laws-rules-for-tenants-subtenants.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">California law</a>, you must obtain written consent from your landlord before subletting, and if your lease says you can&#8217;t sublet, then sorry &#8211; but you really can&#8217;t. You can figure out whether you&#8217;re allowed to sublet in your lease under a clause entitled, &#8216;assignments and sublets&#8217;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-get-approval-from-your-landlord">2. Get approval from your landlord</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re reading this step, then congratulations! You&#8217;re allowed to sublet, even if it does come with a price. You&#8217;ll need to get written approval from your landlord which gives you consent. But even before this, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that you find a subtenant who meets the requirements of the landlord, as you prepare to sublet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-subletter-screening">3. Subletter screening</h2>



<p>Found a potential subletter? Awesome! That means you&#8217;re well on your way to successfully subletting an apartment in Los Angeles. You must find an individual who is as financially stable as you are. Make sure you specify the important subtenant qualifications when marketing your listings. This will help you put together a solid case when you eventually request approval from your landlord.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-send-your-landlord-a-written-request-for-approval">4. Send your landlord a written request for approval</h2>



<p>As a paying renter, you are entitled to many <a href="https://ipropertymanagement.com/laws/california-landlord-tenant-rights" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">renters&#8217; rights in California</a>, meaning that you have standard rights that should not be messed around with. That being said, this next stage requires as much formality as possible. You&#8217;ll need to present your request in the best way, and adhere to state laws meticulously. Emails are acceptable, but it&#8217;s more advisable to use certified mail to avoid future conflict.</p>



<p>In your written request, the following should be included:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The start and end dates of the apartment sublet</li><li>The name of the potential subtenant</li><li>The potential subtenant&#8217;s application, including their financial details</li><li>The potential subtenant&#8217;s permanent house address</li><li>Your reason for subletting or moving out permanently</li><li>If applicable, give your new address during the sublet period</li><li>A written consent of any co-tenant</li><li>A copy of the proposed sublease</li></ol>



<p>There are a lot of steps to take, but no one said subletting in Los Angeles, California was easy!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-wait-for-approval">5. Wait for approval</h2>

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/YKdm91XONLTaw" title="approved"></iframe>
				</div>

	</div>
	


<p>For the first week after submitting, you&#8217;ll need some patience. After that, you can begin to ask for feedback politely. If you still haven&#8217;t gotten a response after thirty days, you can remind them of their &#8216;duty to mitigate&#8217;, stated in Civil Code 1951.2. This term means that a landlord still needs to legally get the rent covered, even if they&#8217;re against sublets. In other words, they&#8217;re still required to accept qualified subtenants to mitigate rent loss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-make-sure-you-collect-the-first-month-of-rent-and-store-it-as-a-security-deposit">6. Make sure you collect the first month of rent and store it as a security deposit</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to avoid any chances of legal hassles or disputes in the subletting process. To stay protected against lost rent, try to get a deposit of a month&#8217;s worth of rent from the subtenant. Be sure to arrange a suitable method for them to pay rent at the end of every month so you can easily transfer the payment to your landlord&#8217;s account.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, renter&#8217;s rights are government protected laws to ensure that tenants always have access to a safe, clean, and hazard-free home. However, renter&#8217;s rights vary according where you live, which is where we come in. <strong>Below, you&#8217;ll learn about living in LA and renter&#8217;s rights.</strong></p>

<p>Tenants have a right to clean, livable housing, and landlords are required to maintain livable units. This implies that doors and windows must be in working order and there must be hot and cold water. Furthermore, the roof and walls should keep out water. Additionally, no vermin should run free in the building or unit. <strong>Basically, &#8220;tenants have a right not to live in slum housing,&#8221; as stated by the Housing Rights Center.</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely not &#8211; unless it&#8217;s an emergency, in which case they don&#8217;t need to give you notice. For example, if there is a fire or flood, the landlord can enter without letting you know first.</p>



<p><strong>However, as per the renter&#8217;s rights in Los Angeles, all non-emergent landlord visits must be duly informed 24-hour prior to visitation</strong>. Furthermore, the landlord can come only during normal business hours. During outside hours, they are supposed to let you know in advance that they will be coming for repairs or showings.</p>

<p>Can your landlord raise your rent? If yes, how often? The rise in rent depends on local laws and ordinances as well as if you live in a rent-controlled home or a non-rent-controlled unit.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rent-controlled housing allows only one annual rent increase. As of July 2021, the percentage <a href="https://www.aaoc.com/news/calculating-your-next-rent-increase##" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase rate is 5%</a> for Los Angeles County.</li>



<li>For non-rent-controlled housing, which is 15-years-old or older, landlords can’t raise the rent more than twice in a year. Moreover, they can’t raise the rent by more than a <a href="https://www.aaoc.com/news/calculating-your-next-rent-increase##" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">total of 5 percent</a>, in addition to the Consumer Price Index rate for your metro area (it&#8217;s 3.3 percent for LA and Long Beach).</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the same trend as above, rent-controlled housing offers more protection to tenants, especially when it comes to no-fault evictions. Essentially, if the rental property is damaged in any way that wasn&#8217;t the tenant&#8217;s fault, the renter&#8217;s rights in Los Angeles will protect you from being evicted unlawfully.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>So, what can you be evicted for in a rent-controlled housing unit?</strong> There are a limited number of reasons including but not restricted to &#8211; failure to pay rent, violation of lease agreement, using the rental unit for illegal activities and so on. The full list as mandated by the LAHD is <a href="https://housing.lacity.org/rental-property-owners/tenant-is-at-fault-for-eviction-owners" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">here.</a></li>



<li><strong>Do the same rules apply to non-rent-controlled housing?</strong> Unfortunately, if you don&#8217;t live in a rent-controlled housing unit, there are fewer restrictions on evictions. However, tenant protection in LA is offered through the state&#8217;s new rent-cap law that demands that a landlord must give just cause for eviction.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-low-income-renters-living-in-la">5. Low Income Renters Living in LA</h3>



<p><strong>As of January 2020, tenant rights in Los Angeles demand that landlords be equally welcoming of renters who use Section 8 vouchers.</strong> It&#8217;s now illegal for landlords to deny renters access to their housing units just because low-income renters pay their rent with the aid of federal programs. <strong>This particular section of renter&#8217;s rights in Los Angeles is an important step forward to ensure that low-income tenants find safe housing to help them keep out of homelessness.</strong></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a leaky pipe or a broken window that wasn&#8217;t your fault, and your landlord isn&#8217;t coming around to fix your problem. In this case, what can you do?</p>



<p><strong>You can escalate your request in 3 steps:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, if there is a problem and your landlord is unresponsive, try to communicate with them verbally. This way you can find out if the matter can be sorted internally.</li>



<li>However, if your landlord still hasn&#8217;t come around to address your concerns, start a paper trail. What does this mean? A dated letter detailing the issue, timestamped pictures of the problem, and other documentation that could later be used, if needed, to show that your landlord was aware of the issue.</li>



<li>Lastly, if the above steps don&#8217;t work, you can <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://housingapp.lacity.org/ReportViolation/Pages/ReportViolation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">report a code violation</a> to the Housing and Community Investment Department (HCID). This falls well within your renter&#8217;s rights in Los Angeles.  </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="weather">Weather</h2>



<p>With so many things to consider, it’s hard to know where to start. One important factor in deciding where you want to live is the climate. LA has mild winters and sweltering summers. If you’re looking to relocate when the weather is more temperate, then the best time to move to LA would be between November and February, when it’s not too hot or too cold. <strong>Winter</strong>, which lasts from November to March, is a very mild and spring-like season. There are many pleasant and sunny days, with daytime temperatures reaching around 20°C (68°F). However, after the rare cold air outbreaks, temperatures at night can approach freezing (0°C or 32°F).&nbsp;In the summer, it may be rather hot, with an average temperature of between 24-25°C (75-77°F). Occasionally, it will be hotter than that, but typically, temperatures don&#8217;t reach as high as 30°C (86°F). Even so, prepare to sweat if you&#8217;re going to be moving boxes in the summer. November is the best time to move to LA to avoid this.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cheaper-rent">Cheaper Rent</h2>



<p>Another thing that makes November the best time to move to LA is the lower rent! Rental costs in Los Angeles peak in June, when they are around 4.1% higher than in November, which is the least expensive month of the year. In Los Angeles, prices for both one- and two-bedroom apartments drop to their lowest points between November and January. One-bedroom prices spike in March, June, and July, while two-bedrooms get pricey (or, you know, pricier than usual) in June and October.</p>

<p>When moving to Los Angeles, you&#8217;ll want to make sure that the location you wish to live in has a decent selection of apartments available for you to choose from. Due to the increase in apartment availability in the wake of the pandemic, you might also be able to secure a better lease. When an apartment has been on the market for a long time, landlords are more likely to negotiate. So, right now might be the best time to move to LA from that perspective.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="school-enrolment-and-job-opportunities">School Enrolment and Job Opportunities</h2>



<p>If you have school-aged children, you might be better off moving in June or July, even if it is more expensive. That way, they will have more time to get used to their new home and surroundings before school starts up. It&#8217;s also important to consider the location of the property you&#8217;re looking at renting, as you won&#8217;t want to live too far from the school or your workplace.</p>



<p>The job market in Los Angeles is extremely competitive. If you are presently unemployed and looking for work, you may have a better chance of finding a job before you relocate to the city than if you wait until you arrive. Rent is quite high in this city, and unless you have a substantial cash buffer, you will run into financial difficulties without a job. Also keep in mind that many of the younger residents here, who include students and young professionals, share an apartment with at least one roommate in order to save money.</p>
