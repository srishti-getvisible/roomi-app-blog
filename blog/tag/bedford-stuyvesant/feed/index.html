<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bed-Stuy is known for its <b>beautiful architecture</b></strong></h2>



<p>This Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood guide wants to take you straight to <span style="font-weight: 400;">the brownstone architecture that is one of Bed-Stuy’s most striking features. Brownstone is a kind of sandstone and New York is famous for it. But even amongst NYC’s rich history and world-class architecture, Bed-Stuy stands out as a prime example. A lot of thought, subtle creativity, and ornamental detail has gone into these gorgeous buildings. A lot of modern architecture embraces a minimalism that can be elegant but easily crosses the line into sterile. Not so with Bed-Stuy’s vibrant community. So follow the </span>Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood guide and note that <span style="font-weight: 400;">when discussing Bed-Stuy buildings with your neighbor, you’re more likely to</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford%E2%80%93Stuyvesant,_Brooklyn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">use words like</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brackets, quoins, fluting, finials, frieze, and cornice branding. And yes. It all looks as beautiful as it sounds.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The neighborhood is going through an <b>exciting and dynamic change</b></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bed-Stuy is growing, changing, and evolving.</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/realestate/bedford-stuyvesant-diverse-and-changing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New restaurants and bars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are popping up all the time.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Corner store shops and cafes salt and pepper the neighborhood. Bed-Stuy had a pretty rough reputation for a while, it’s true. But the area is</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://nypost.com/2016/01/07/gritty-bed-stuy-is-starting-to-show-its-softer-side/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">definitely gentrifying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The area is attracting people who like a slower paced neighborhood with tree lined streets and lots of history.</span></p>
