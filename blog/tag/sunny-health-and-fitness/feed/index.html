										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In our fast-paced, consumerist world of processed food and delivery apps, it can be hard to pay attention to our minds and bodies. For many of us, spending quarantine inside our homes cut off access to gym facilities, personal trainers, yoga classes, and much more. When daily life confines you to the four walls of your home, how do you get a total body workout that nourishes you? With the help of fitness apps, a little self-discipline, and <a href="https://sunnyhealthfitness.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw6fCCBhBNEiwAem5SO2VY99QYImBAcfq2Zmt9GRIS0CJR5CT_0xhbhR4BfqXNixmhegz_1RoCiy0QAvD_BwE" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunny health and fitness</a> at home equipment, a little can go a long way.</p>



<p>Despite what the Instagram fitness industry may try to sell you, fitness does not have a certain look or type. A healthy body helps you accomplish your daily tasks with ease. </p>



<p>In fact, <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1356336X19882060?journalCode=epea#:~:text=Health%2Drelated%20fitness%20(HRF),endurance%2C%20flexibility%20and%20body%20composition.)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">health-related fitness</a> comprises your cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition. A total body workout is the best way to maintain fitness across these areas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the 5 components of health-related fitness you can achieve through a total body workout?</strong></h2>



<p>According to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.verywellfit.com/the-components-of-fitness-4154074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verywellfit</a> and <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/healthtopics/physactivity.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">CDC</a>, regular physical activity boosts health-related fitness by reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, along with mental health benefits. Exercises can be done at home with equipment from Sunny health and fitness or using guided fitness apps.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The five benefits of health-related fitness exercises include:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Increased cardiovascular endurance (no panting when you climb a few flights of stairs)</li><li>Muscular endurance (6 shopping bags in one go, beast mode on!)</li><li>Higher flexibility (fewer aches and pains at the end of the day)</li><li>Muscular strength (easily lift your dog)</li><li>Better body composition (ideal body fat to muscle ratio that suits your body type)</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why choose a total body workout when you can just train the part your need to look its best?</h2>



<p>According to Sunny health and fitness experts, a total body workout can help you achieve overall fitness, including in your target areas. We get it, chiseled abs and a sculpted butt are something we all desire. However, overtraining or undertraining certain areas can increase your risk of injury. Total body workouts, whether guided by a personal trainer or times fitness apps are easier to handle no matter your prior experience.</p>

<p>Kettlebells are one of the best options for a total body workout at home as they are easy to store and can be used to train various parts of your body</p>



<p>To get started with kettlebells, start with smaller and lighter weights and eventually increase both as you get comfortable. Some beginner total body workout exercises with kettlebells include wide squats, kettlebell swings, or reverse lunges.</p>

<p><strong>A 10-minute Kettlebell workout to get you started</strong>:</p>

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Try an in-home rower</h3>



<p>When space is not an issue, a rowing machine can give you simultaneous upper and lower body exercise. It also provides you with low-impact cardio which is a win-win situation.</p>



<p>Rowing helps increase muscle endurance and cardiovascular fitness. You can find a rhythm, increase resistance as you go to get both cardio and strength benefits.</p>



<p><strong>Beginner option from Sunny health and fitness: <a href="https://sunnyhealthfitness.com/products/sunny-health-and-fitness-sf-rw5515-magnetic-rowing-machine-rower-w-lcd-monitor" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">SF-RW5515 Magnetic Rowing Machine</a></strong></p>

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Elliptical for the win</h3>



<p>Ellipticals are fairly easy to have and use at home, especially when you cannot go out due to pandemic lockdown restrictions. Perhaps you simply find it more convenient to work out at home with your work-from-home schedule.</p>



<p>An elliptical activates muscles in your lower body while also stimulating your chest and arms. It is therefore very handy for a total body workout.</p>



<p>Working out on an elliptical also puts less impact on your joints and knees, making it easy to use no matter your body weight or size.</p>



<p><strong>Try this 20 min elliptical workout from Sunny health and fitness:</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Suspension bodyweight trainer (TRX)</h3>



<p>Invented by a <a href="https://www.athleticbusiness.com/iclubs/randy-hetrick-founder-of-trx.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">US Navy seal </a>(that’s how you know it’s real), the TRX is short for total-body resistance exercise.</p>



<p>This equipment is another great option for limited space and storage at home. All you need is your body weight and gravity to attain a total body workout.</p>



<p>To use them, all you have to do is secure the straps to a sturdy spot and the rest of the exercises involve your body suspending in the air partly, leaning back- essentially providing resistance for every kind of workout.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. HIIT total body workout (only gym mat needed!)</h3>



<p>For a quick total body workout when all you need and maybe can afford (it’s alright, we understand) is a gym mat, HIIT is a useful solution. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-hiit" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">HIIT</a> stands for high-intensity interval training.</p>



<p>Try this HIIT workout from Sunny health and fitness that targets building strong lean muscle in your upper body, lower body, and core while burning calories.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="20 Minute Full Body HIIT Workout" width="1250" height="703" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouJWbaUZ924?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>You can also use fitness apps like Interval timer (<strong>Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intervaltimerfree.app" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/interval-timer-hiit-workouts/id406473568" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a>)</strong> or Freeletics (<strong>Download: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freeletics.lite&amp;hl=en_IN" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freeletics-workout-fitness/id654810212" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a></strong>) to complete a HIIT total body workout at home.</p>
