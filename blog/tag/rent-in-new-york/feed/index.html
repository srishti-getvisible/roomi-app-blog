<p>Living in Brooklyn can be expensive; it&#8217;s a good idea to start <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/9-reasons-why-living-with-a-roommate-is-awesome-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking for roommates</a> in the city as soon as possible unless you can afford <strong>rooms for rent in Brooklyn for $500</strong>.</p>



<p>The food scene is diverse, with plenty of opportunities to explore diverse authentic cuisines. Explore your love for arts, music and more in the city, with plenty of fairs taking place throughout the year. As a student, you are likely to have the time of your life, so start hunting for <strong>apartments in Brooklyn,</strong> right away!</p>



<p>Universities in Brooklyn that you may be interested in:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.pratt.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pratt Institute</a></li><li><a href="https://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/home.php" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooklyn College</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cuny.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">City University of New York (CUNY)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.kbcc.cuny.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingsborough Community College</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sjcny.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph’s College</a></li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Transit Friendly is Brooklyn, NY?</strong></h2>



<p>Reliable public transport makes life easier, especially for young professionals. Owning a car isn’t a necessity, but it doesn’t hurt either. Be careful though, as Brooklyn does not have a permit parking system which can make parking your car challenging.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability</h3>



<p>The pleasant weather and clear sidewalks make walking around Brooklyn a breeze. Be careful though, Brooklyn is the largest borough in NYC, so it might take you a while to get to your destination on foot.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Traffic</h3>



<p>If you are planning on getting a car, or travelling via a cab, keep plenty of time in hand. Traffic is a problem in any part of NYC, but seems to be especially bad in some neighbourhoods. During rush hours and office timings, you can expect your car to move at a snail’s pace.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis</h3>



<p>Green cabs, which are designated for the outer boroughs of New York, such as the Bronx and Brooklyn, are another convenient way to get around in Brooklyn. If you’re <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/uber-or-taxi-in-nyc-which-is-better/">not a fan of waiting around for a cab</a> like most other residents, Uber and Lyft will be your friend.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public Transportation</h3>



<p>No car? No worries! Though people may complain about the NYC Subway, it is the most affordable and reliable way to get around the city. With 170 subway stations scattered throughout the borough, the NYC subway is the most convenient way to get around, but it isn’t the only option.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Subway in Brooklyn, New York 2020 (N-Train)" width="1250" height="703" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bocPR_9xfpg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>With 55 bus routes (most on old streetcar lines) across Brooklyn, buses are another reliable form of transportation. When you are new to the city, you can download MTA’s official <a href="https://bustime.mta.info/">Bus Time</a> app to know when to catch your bus.</p>



<p>Over 9 million riders use the Ferry system annually, making it one of the most popular ways of getting around, especially those who live in the waterfront neighbourhoods. Th</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Airports</h3>



<p>You can access three of New York&#8217;s Airports from Brooklyn via public transport, ride shares, or driving yourself. If you&#8217;ve <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/know-live-brooklyn/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">lived in Brooklyn for a while</a>, you will know to avoid Newark as much as possible. JFK and LGA are the best option, with JFK International Airport being the most accessible one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Is Brooklyn Cycle-friendly?</h3>



<p>Ocean Parkway is home America’s first Bike Path; hence, it comes as no surprise that Brooklyn is a great option for those who love to cycle. Currently, Brooklyn has over 300 miles in bike lanes across the borough, ensuring a safe ride for all. For those without a bike who don’t want to miss out on the fun, it is easy to rent one from Citi Bike, a bike share initiative by New York.</p>



<p>e Ferry system is expanding, and newer stops are being added throughout the city to make it more accessible to people.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Historical Landmarks in Brooklyn</h2>



<p>Brooklyn is home to some famous historical sites, such as:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.mcny.org/event/past-event-man-who-built-brooklyn-bridge?gclid=CjwKCAjw9r-DBhBxEiwA9qYUpXcoWR-InwMtokCDAIJCaADtpPEslALPR2LO58I7V3ha3GU6aiHkexoCN6sQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooklyn Bridge</a></li><li><a href="https://www.coneyisland.com/tourist-information" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Coney Island</a></li><li><a href="https://www.janescarousel.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jane’s Carousel</a></li></ol>

There are many <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/finding-no-fee-apartments-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">areas in New York</a>, where renting short term apartments would be an unsafe choice. If it is an option, walk around the neighborhood once or twice to really get to know the vibe of the place. See what your potential neighbors are like. Trust us, it’s very easy to get stuck with terrible short term rentals if you’re unfamiliar with the city. Of course, this research becomes more difficult if you’re from out of town. In that case, do all your research online. See what other people have said about the neighborhood. The subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">AskNYC</a>, can be a fantastic resource for you. Ask any questions you have and we’re sure some good NYC samaritans will help you out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make a list of your wants/needs before looking at short term rentals</h2>



<p>Wouldn’t we all love to rent a beautiful fully-furnished penthouse that overlooks Central Park? But alas, our budgets bring us back down to earth and force us to be realistic. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/hacks-to-help-you-find-the-perfect-apartment-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apartment rentals in NYC</a>, especially if it’s on a monthly basis, are really expensive. So here’s where you really need to sit down and ask yourself what it is that you really want. Yes, a Central Park facing apartment is really nice, but do you really need it? Similarly, if you’re looking for short term apartments in New York for 3 or 4 months, it might be smart to invest in one that is fully furnished. Only you know the specifics of your situation, so make sure you do a cost/benefit analysis before signing anything.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure you know the legalities before looking at short term rentals</h2>



<p>As short term vacation homes have become more <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomis-year-in-review-what-the-2020-room-rental-market-looked-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular</a>, there has been some serious backlash from residents. Especially in New York where several communities have passed ordinances that regulate short term rentals. So, for example, you have to lease apartment rentals in NYC on at least a monthly basis, not less than that. Make sure you know the rules and regulations of the building beforehand or may end up paying for it, literally. All of this confusion around regulations has led to an increase in <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/nyc-rental-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scams</a>, and you really don’t want to get sucked into any of that. So, if you’re looking for short term apartments in New York, make sure you are fully informed about the legal aspect of renting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Right place, right time</h2>



<p>As you may already know, New York City is one of the most expensive places to live in the world. Which means that short term rentals are going to be even more expensive than regular apartments. But the thing is, you might actually get a very good deal depending on what time of year it is. So, for example, during peak tourist season, the rent for short term apartments in New York are going to skyrocket. You may even find it hard to find an apartment in the neighborhood you want. In this case, you will really have to make compromises and make the best of the situation. But if you can time your trip right, you might just find a great apartment at a great price. So, you might want to factor that in if you’re looking for apartment rentals in NYC on a monthly basis!</p>

<p>Is your bad credit getting in the way of your dream of finding an apartment in NYC? Moving to New York City is a fantasy for many, but this dream can come crashing down when faced with our credit scores. Looking for a place for rent in New York is a daunting task. Adding bad credit to the mix makes things even more challenging. Fear not, Roomi has tips that can still help you in finding an apartment in the city.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-getting-started-finding-an-apartment-for-rent-in-nyc-when-you-have-poor-credit"><strong>Getting started: finding an apartment for rent in NYC when you have poor credit</strong></h2>



<p>So you know you have bad credit, perhaps too many student loans, or a variety of financial difficulties have put you in this difficult spot. Maybe you just hit the minimum payment option too much when paying off your credit card.</p>



<p>Before you start looking for help finding an apartment, it may be best to come to terms entirely with your credit situation.</p>



<p>If you still have time before you start looking for a place to rent in New York, you may be able to salvage the situation to fix your credit.</p>



<p>To do this, get a copy of your credit score, sit down and identify exact problem areas where you may have fallen through. You can use free credit monitoring services like <a href="https://mint.intuit.com/how-mint-works/credit" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mint</a> or <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/?s=affiliate-tax&amp;adcampaign=tax_acq_impact_efile&amp;adgroup=10078_Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;adcopy=Online%20Tracking%20Link&amp;click_id=1a%3AzdcU3cxyLW9UwUx0Mo3QBUkEQ7O3gLSv5WQ0&amp;ovkey=12855&amp;returnurl=%2Ftax&amp;irgwc=1&amp;click_id=18Z2KMU3cxyLWzG0Rw0UrUzuUkEQ7O3gLSv5WQ0&amp;ovkey=2623632&amp;ovmtc=2623632&amp;%243p=a_impact_radius&amp;AppInstallRef=impact&amp;ShareId=&amp;subID1=&amp;subID2=&amp;subID3=&amp;%7Ecampaign_id=10161&amp;%7Eclick_id=18Z2KMU3cxyLWzG0Rw0UrUzuUkEQ7O3gLSv5WQ0&amp;%7Esecondary_publisher=&amp;s=impact_acq&amp;adcampaign=impact_acq_2019&amp;adgroup=Media%20Source%20Tracking%20Ad&amp;irgwc=1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit Karma</a> to receive a breakdown of your credit history. Here you may notice some erroneous payments or simply a high number of credit cards that need to be paid off.</p>



<p>Credit monitoring services are easily able to point out where your credit score went off the rails. Potential problems include high balances, multiple late payments, or overdue debt collections.</p>

<p>Most landlords who have apartments for rent in New York will most likely ask for a credit check, background check, a security deposit, and first month’s rent.</p>



<p>While the larger rental corporations and housing societies may not accept your bad credit, you may try your luck with mom and pop-type landlord situations. You can have a conversation with them, let them know about your limitations, and hope for the best response.</p>



<p>If you’re in luck, they may empathize with you (especially given the COVID-19 financial crisis) and let you get away with giving a higher security deposit and just the first month’s rent. Although rare, it may just help in finding an apartment in NYC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-get-help-in-finding-an-apartment-by-using-a-personal-guarantor"><strong>Get help in finding an apartment by using a personal guarantor</strong></h2>



<p>This is one of the most common solutions on the internet for the bad credit problem. A guarantor, by definition, is someone who is legally bound to pay your rent in case of a payment failure from your end. Any adult can qualify to be a personal guarantor— family, friends, and even corporations.</p>



<p><strong>It, therefore, comes as no surprise that using a co-signer or guarantor makes you a more desirable renter.</strong></p>

<p>However, to have someone be a guarantor to help you rent in New York, there are a few caveats. <strong>They need to have an airtight credit history of their own</strong> <strong>and make <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2013/06/07/why-some-use-a-co-signer-on-their-apartment-lease" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">at least 80 times</a> the monthly rent in income.</strong></p>



<p>Maybe you do not have the option to use a friend or family member as a cosigner. Perhaps you do not wish to put this burden on your family or friends. In this case, a rental cosigning company is a possible solution.</p>



<p>Popular choices in NYC include &nbsp;<a href="https://www.insurent.com/renters/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Insurent Lease Guaranty</a> and <a href="https://theguarantors.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Guarantors</a>. International students often use this option when they do not know anyone locally to be their co-signer. Although the rental cosigning option comes with a fee, it will make your application stronger for rent in New York.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sublet-an-apartment-with-roommates">Sublet an apartment/ with roommates</h2>



<p>Subletting an apartment with bad credit is a tricky option. However,  you can try this if you have friends who may be comfortable subletting to you. In this case, they are the ones who remain on the main lease. </p>



<p>That way, you won&#8217;t directly have to deal with the landlord or provide your credit score.  But your trust quotient with roommates would need to be very high.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-get-a-letter-of-recommendation-from-your-previous-landlord"><strong>Get a letter of recommendation from your previous landlord</strong></h2>



<p>Just like when you apply for a new job, a letter of recommendation speaks to your abilities and character. What better way to let your new rental landlord know he’ll be just fine in your hands?</p>



<p>In addition to a signed testament from your previous landlord, you can also get references from your current employer. Especially if you have a good employment history, it can help massively in finding an apartment quickly.</p>

<p>Before 2019, finding an apartment for rent in New York was possible through a large upfront payment of up to six months’ rent. However, in 2019,  New York state passed rental laws that stopped this practice. This was because landlords would abuse this power when a renter really wanted the apartment.</p>



<p>Some renters today who are unaware of this practice still pay this large amount upfront. It is now illegal to do so in the State of New York.</p>
