<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting started</h2>



<p>Before you step out and spend those precious dollars, here are a few things to keep in mind. You will need to shell out some cash to decorate your off-campus housing. Hence, be sure that what you buy is going to fit your student apartment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="12924" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/decorate-off-campus-housing-on-a-budget/attachment/home-decor-couch-cushion/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2560,1707" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="home-decor-couch-cushion" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="a grey couch with blue cushions" class="wp-image-12924" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Budget</h3>



<p>It can be easy to get carried away while decorating your off campus housing. Dorms and campus housing may have restrictions when it comes to decoration or modifications. However, off campus housing is a lot more flexible. Be sure that you set a budget and do not spend on unnecessary items or furniture. Remember you can always buy something later if you still feel that you really want it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Available space</h3>



<p>Do you really need that 50 inch T.V. or that huge fluffy rug? Don&#8217;t get carried away when you shop. And be realistic. Make sure what you buy will actually fit in your off campus housing, and is practical. There is still a lot you can do if you are working with a small space. However, be sure you don&#8217;t overdo it and end up with a cluttered apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pets</h3>



<p>Having a pet is a commitment that you need to take seriously. Thus, be sure that you have your furry friend in mind while decorating and furnishing your off campus housing. Make sure that you are creating an environment that is safe and comfortable for your pet. Also, keep in mind that you need a place for your pet to sleep and relieve themselves! Shedding can also be something that you need to plan for, to avoid a mess. Fragile decorations on open shelves can also be a disaster. Ask yourself if the things you are buying are going to be a problem.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Aesthetic</h3>



<p>It is easy to see something pretty and spring for it in the spur of the moment. However, do consider if what you are buying will actually fit your aesthetic and that of your off campus housing. The last thing that you want, is to buy something and then realize that you really don&#8217;t like it that much. Hence, be sure to set the vibe you want to go for!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Practicality and mindfulness</h3>



<p>While you may really think that fancy ceramic shot glass set will really up your house party game, hold on. When you&#8217;re on a budget, be careful of your temptation to spring for fancier and more pricey versions of things. Don&#8217;t fall for marketing and end up going beyond your means! However, this doesn&#8217;t mean you should always buy cheaper and low-quality items. Being mindful is the key here. Before buying something, ask yourself. Is this going to add value to me or my space?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buying furniture</h2>



<p>If you are moving into an unfurnished off campus housing, then the first thing you&#8217;ll need to buy is furniture. Get started with a list of things you will need to furnish your off campus apartment. Make sure that you are getting everything and not less, and definitely not more. Again, remember, that mahogany shelf may look great in the corner, but do you really need it?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to get?</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s start off with the essentials. You will need a bed and mattress to start off. A solid and comfortable study desk and chair is also a good investment. Beyond this, it really depends on the size and nature of your off campus housing. If you are living in a studio apartment, you may want to keep it limited and only get a small couch or coffee table. However, if you are moving into a bigger space and sharing it, you may want to get a larger couch and table for your common spaces.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where to get it?</h3>



<p>For furniture, you may want to check out <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">IKEA</a>. This basically your one-stop shop for all your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/affordable-furniture-shops-when-living-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">furniture needs</a>! Other than this, you can visit local stores and look for deals as well. Buying used furniture online is also a great option. You can often find great deals on used furniture that can save you a decent buck. Remember, these are things that you will use regularly and need to last you a while. Hence, take your time and do your share of window shopping.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buying applicances and decoration</h2>



<p>After you&#8217;ve got yourself the essentials with a full set of furniture, appliances and accessories are next. This is the place where you should exercise your fair share of caution. It can be easy to splurge too much on these items. Be sure you are getting what you need, and that it adds value to your space and life.</p>

<p>Again, this can widely vary depending on your lifestyle and the size of your off campus housing. If you are going to be cooking at home, a fridge and stove are going to be essential. Beyond this, you can get a microwave, blender or oven depending on the kind of cooking you do. If you are going to be eating out or in your college mess, you may want to skip this all. Ask yourself if you need a television and if you and your flat mates are actually going to using it. When it comes to decoration, keep all the earlier tips in mind, and consult with your roommates if you have any.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where to get it?</h3>



<p>You can look to <a href="https://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart</a> or <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/?intl=nosplash" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Bestbuy</a> to find appliances and other decorations. They usually have a large selection and decent prices. You can also look to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> and easily find great deals online as well. Try <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Etsy</a> for handmade and more personalized decor and art. Again, be sure to check with local stores for deals.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the end of the month, and you have one week to get your next paycheck. If eating healthy, preparing easy meals, and sticking to a budget is on your mind, then your finger tapping has brought you to the right article. Here are our top easy healthy meals on a budget for you. There&#8217;s something for everyone &#8211; vegan dishes included!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-easy-healthy-meal-1-vegan-pancakes">Easy Healthy Meal #1 &#8211; Vegan Pancakes</h2>



<p>Imagine soft, thick fluffy pancakes that you can enjoy for breakfast or even for dessert. If easy healthy meals on a budget is on your mind &#8211; then this is something you must try. Made with super basic ingredients and a meal that can be enjoyed as a breakfast or dinner. Let&#8217;s get straight to it, shall we?</p>



<p>For this, you will need:</p>



<p>1 Cup flour (roughly 125g)</p>



<p>1 tbsp. baking powder (for that sweet rise)</p>



<p>2 tbsp. sugar (depending on how sweet you like it)</p>



<p>1/2 tbsp. salt (love how this balances the flavor)</p>



<p>1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar (don&#8217;t worry &#8211; your pancakes are safe!)</p>



<p>1 tbsp. Vanilla essence (can&#8217;t imagine a world without vanilla essence)</p>



<p>1 cup non-dairy milk (in this recipe, we will be using almond milk but, you can use oat/coconut/cashew milk)</p>



<p>Time to whisk, pour, flip and devour!</p>



<p>Take a medium bowl &#8211; add the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt, and stir to combine. In a separate bowl, add all the wet ingredients, and stir to mix them evenly. Pour the liquid mixture into the dry mixture and whisk to make a smooth batter. Let this sit for 5 minutes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, heat a pan and keep it on medium flame, pour roughly half a cup of the pancake mix and flip it over when it starts to bubble. Cook until golden. <em>Voila</em>!</p>



<p>Enjoy your stack with Nutella, jam or honey.</p>



<p>Pro tip &#8211; Save/freeze the remaining batter to use later!</p>



<p>Next up on our easy healthy meals on a budget is our personal fave:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-easy-healthy-meal-2-herby-chicken-breast-with-veggies">Easy Healthy Meal #2 &#8211; Herby chicken breast with veggies</h2>



<p>This perfect dinner recipe is a beautiful marriage between juicy chicken breast and healthy veggies. It&#8217;s so simple yet so flavorful &#8211; you&#8217;ll be cooking it all year long.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s get started by finding these in your kitchen:</p>



<p>1 medium-sized red potato (chop big rough pieces)</p>



<p>2 medium carrots</p>



<p>2 celery stalks</p>



<p>1 medium red onion</p>



<p>2 tbsp. olive oil</p>



<p>Salt &amp; Pepper</p>



<p>3 chicken breasts</p>



<p>1 lemon halved</p>



<p>1/4 cup chopped parsley</p>



<p>Optional: Seasoning and dried/fresh herbs</p>



<p>Meanwhile stomach: I will now demonstrate a whale&#8217;s mating call.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s not keep those whales wailing &#8211; begin by preheating the oven to 450 degrees F. Roughly chop your veggies &#8211; big chunky pieces work best. Toss these veggies in olive oil, salt and pepper, and arrange them on a baking sheet in a single layer. Pop the baking tray into the oven on the top-most section. Roast until the vegetables become slightly brown and the potatoes begin to soften.</p>



<p>Grab the breasts. Not yours, silly! The chicken breasts &#8211; prep them by rubbing some olive oil, salt, and dried herbs such as rosemary, oregano, black pepper, or chilli flakes. Carefully place the chicken breast on top of the veggies and let it cook for 20-25 mins until the skin turns golden brown. If the juice runs clear when pierced, your chicken is good and ready! Bring out the veggies, toss them in lemon juice and serve alongside your delicious chicken.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi Tip</strong> &#8211; Save the leftovers for a yummy steamy soup, or deep freeze it for a stir fry later.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-freezing-food-kill-coronavirus">Does freezing food kill coronavirus?</h2>



<p>We hate to be the bearer of bad news but deep freezing food DOESN&#8217;T kill the coronavirus, at least <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://instituteforfoodsafety.cornell.edu/coronavirus-covid-19/food-industry-resources/food-industry-faqs/" target="_blank">that&#8217;s what the FDA says</a>.</p>



<p>Currently, there&#8217;s not much research on this matter to support this hypothesis &#8211; though we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve heard the rumors, too! The best practice to follow is to wash your hands with soap and water before preparing or eating food. Wash your hands diligently, and always take precautions when stepping out.
