<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Not all pets need a lot of space!</h2>



<p>If you live in an apartment or small space, having a pet can seem like a challenge. But it doesn’t have to be! There are many low-maintenance pets for apartments that will thrive in your living environment, even if you don’t have much space to work with.</p>



<p>Cats, dogs, fish, hamsters—these are just a few of the many animals that make great pets for apartments. But when it comes to choosing which pet is right for you, we recommend asking yourself a few key questions. Do I want a pet that takes up a lot of my time? Do I want to clean up after my pet? These questions can help narrow down your choices and find the right fluffy (or scaly) fit for you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Dogs</h2>

<p>Some small dogs are great pets for apartments and small spaces, and would make great apartment dwellers since they&#8217;re usually a lot of fun! When trained well, dogs are generally very friendly and welcoming to anyone that visits their home. While not every dog is a low-maintenance pet or suitable for those living in small spaces of apartments, do your research to find a breed that thrives in this environment. Your pup will provide companionship, affection, and entertainment without the need for a large backyard to run around in! Just make sure you take him/her on regular walks.</p>

<p>Cats can be great pets for apartments or small homes, and they certainly keep your home lively and interesting. Not only will they keep you company when you&#8217;re alone, but cats are easy to care for &#8211; they can be trained to use a litter box, and are great pets for small spaces. Playful and affectionate, kitties are perfect if you live in a quiet home. These low-maintenance pets are super chill and don&#8217;t need a lot of space.</p>

<p>Whether you have a small apartment, a large family, or are just tired of cleaning up after your pets, fish can be the perfect solution. They require little space and very little maintenance, only asking for daily food and weekly water changes. In fact, many apartment dwellers keep fish as their only pet, since they&#8217;ve been known to make you feel relaxed. Plus &#8211; you can find some beautiful varieties and build up a happy, colorful tank!</p>

These lovely creatures &#8211; although they don&#8217;t require much space &#8211; still need plenty of love and attention and are a great way to bring some life into your home.</p>

<p>You know it’s time for a pet when you feel like something is missing from your home. However, with small apartments often come big responsibilities. Many traditional pets are not ideal for small spaces such as apartments or condos &#8211; but that doesn’t mean you can&#8217;t get something fun! Get a hamster! These adorable creatures make great pets because they&#8217;re easy to care for and don&#8217;t take up much room at all. A hamster is a fantastic pet for apartments or small spaces since they are clean and quiet pets, who don’t need a lot of room to run around!</p>

<p>Rabbits can be a wonderful addition to an apartment or small space since they are quiet pets. They are as clean and friendly as other pets, but they have several unique traits that can make them easier for people with limited living spaces to accommodate. They’re (cuddly) low-maintenance pets, can be easily toilet trained, and don’t require a lot of space, making them one of the best apartment-friendly pets!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Things to consider before getting pets for apartments</h2>



<p>Even bringing a low-maintenance pet into your household is a major decision! You need to be fully committed to caring for an animal for the rest of its life. You want to enjoy your pet without having to worry about their health and wellbeing. With that being said, consider these things before adding pets to the family!</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If you are considering getting a pet, you should make sure that your apartment community allows pets. Ask management if there will be any fees or charges imposed on your lease agreement.</li><li>Find out if you or anyone in your home has allergies. You should also make sure that your roommate is comfortable with getting pets for apartments.</li><li>Some animals are social and are happier in pairs. Not having a social partner might make your pet depressed &#8211; and you definitely don&#8217;t want that! Ask the advisor in the pet store if they recommend you buy one or two animals.</li><li>When you decide to get a pet, be sure to think about the future. Think about what you&#8217;d do if you took a vacation or moved to a building that doesn&#8217;t allow animals. It is never good for an animal to be alone for too long without the attention of a loving owner.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Pets <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://time.com/collection/guide-to-happiness/4728315/science-says-pet-good-for-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make our lives much better</a>, don&#8217;t they? They&#8217;re our little (nuisance creating) buddies that have a huge presence. (Think: wagging tails hitting objects and people, howling at the moon at 3 am, and the occasional stinky poo.) That&#8217;s why we need the proper initiation when living with pets in the house we rent. That means that the landlord, your roommates, and all others involved have to be in tandem with your furry little bud&#8217;s needs and desires, as well as yours. And while there&#8217;s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/pet-fee-cost-of-pet-friendly-apartments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">p</a>et fees and approvals involved with a regular pet, in the case of emotional support dogs, you have certain rights that you can exercise for you and your ESA (emotional support animal) dog&#8217;s well-being.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s deep dive into how to make the process of living with your emotional support dog easier for everyone involved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is an emotional support animal?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;ve seen the first episode of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80191036" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">dogs on Netflix</a>, you&#8217;ll know what we mean when we say &#8216;service dogs.&#8217; And you&#8217;ll also know the difference between service dogs and emotional support dogs. For those who haven&#8217;t (make sure you don&#8217;t miss it!) <a href="https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">service dogs</a> have trained their entire life to assist someone with a physical or mental disability that poses a danger to their lives when out and about in the world.</p>



<p>For example, a person with epilepsy or a blind person might have a service dog. The pooch would be allowed to go everywhere their humans go, because without the guide dog, their lives could be in danger.</p>



<p>On the other hand, emotional support dogs may or may not be recognized by your state.</p>



<p>As the website for Americans with Disabilities Act mentions,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>If the dog has been trained to sense that an anxiety attack is about to happen and take a specific action to help avoid the attack or lessen its impact, that would qualify as a service animal. However, if the dog&#8217;s mere presence provides comfort, that would not be considered a service animal under the ADA.</p></blockquote>



<p>And it&#8217;s true that all our furry buddies, no matter their designation, put a big smile on our faces and make our hearts lighter. However, emotional support dogs go that extra mile to provide comfort to people who have debilitating mental conditions like severe social anxiety or depression that seriously harms their lives.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to get an emotional support dog</h2>



<p>While service dogs require special training and may be chosen for you by their trainers to suit your disability, ESA dogs can be of your choosing. So when you&#8217;re thinking of bringing home a canine roommate who will ease all your troubles, you need to interview them (and try and understand their woofs) just like you would in the case of a human roommate.</p>



<p>Get to know them better, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">observe how they make you feel</a> and also read up on what it is like to live with pets.</p>



<p>For example, if you need a dog with a calming effect on you, you should probably stay away from overly energetic dogs.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you love being outside and a morning run elevates your mood, then you&#8217;ll find good companionship in an energetic animal who needs to run to stay healthy.</p>



<p>Visit adoption centres or pet stores, meet some dogs, meet their owners/breeders, and make a good couple of days out of choosing your new best friend! (Or letting them choose you!)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do I have to pay pet fees for an emotional support dog?</h2>



<p>In short, no you don&#8217;t have to. But let&#8217;s look at this in depth.</p>



<p>Under the <a href="https://www.fairhousingnc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DRNC-SelfAdvocacyPacket-Animals-in-Housing-ACC-06.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fair Housing Act</a>, &#8216;reasonable accommodation&#8217; allows your ESA dog unrestricted entry into any landlord&#8217;s home, (even the ones that don&#8217;t allow living with pets.)</p>



<p>However, there are some exceptions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Rental dwellings of four or less units, where one unit is occupied by the owner.</li><li>Single family homes sold or rented by the owner without the use of a broker.</li><li>Housing owned by private clubs or religious organizations that restrict occupancy in housing units to their members.</li></ul>



<p>Now that the accommodation rules are out of the way, you should know that service and ESA dogs are not regular pets, so you don&#8217;t need to pay pet fees to live together. However, the landlord does have the right to charge a security deposit and can demand for more, if the ESA dog happens to cause any damage to their property.</p>



<p>And if there is a bigger issue, the landlord can also seek legal help, and may be able to get you and your emotional support dog to move.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to register a dog as emotional support animal</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that a service dog has to be registered and certified.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there&#8217;s no requirement for an emotional dog registration or certification. You just need an official ESA letter by your licensed therapist.</p>



<p>That said, we&#8217;d urge you not to get <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/12/fake-emotional-support-animals-service-dogs" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fake emotional support animal letter</a> if living with regular pets help you stay mentally and physically stable, so as to not hinder the progress of real ESAs and their respective owner&#8217;s health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you and your furry best friend are looking for an apartment to call home, pet-friendly apartments are what you need to look for! And if you&#8217;re thinking how can people (landlords) be so cold-hearted as to not allow a little furry buddy inside the apartment that they&#8217;re not even going to be living in, well, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/27/why-wont-landlords-allow-renters-to-have-pets-8183016/">they have their reasons</a>. However, thankfully, some landlords have succumbed to loving our four-legged friends and will allow it. But like all good things in life, it doesn&#8217;t come for free, unfortunately. So here&#8217;s everything you need to know about pet-friendly apartments, and the differences between pet fees, pet security deposit, and pet rent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First things first, how do you find pet friendly apartments?</h2>



<p>Say it with us: Renters&#8217; rights!</p>



<p>Read up on <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/archive/assets/pdfs/pets/renting_with_pets/recommended_pet_policies.pdf" class="broken_link">state laws</a> to find out whether pets are allowed for renters to keep wherever you live. Then head on to helpful websites like <a href="https://peoplewithpets.com/">people with pets</a>, or use Roomi&#8217;s awesome pet filter to find rooms and roommates that are okay with pets!</p>



<p>Now once you find pet-friendly apartments to shortlist, let&#8217;s get to know about the pet fees you&#8217;ll need to incur to make sure Floofy pays his/her share of rent (through you of course.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="634" height="951" data-attachment-id="13159" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/pet-fee-cost-of-pet-friendly-apartments/attachment/pet-friendly-apart/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?fit=634%2C951&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="634,951" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pet-friendly-apart" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?fit=634%2C951&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?resize=634%2C951&#038;ssl=1" alt="cat playing with her pet friendly owner " class="wp-image-13159" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?w=634&amp;ssl=1 634w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Okay, so what&#8217;s the damage?</h2>



<p>Before diving deep into the costs, make sure it&#8217;s all there <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-apartment-features-check-signing-lease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the lease</a> so you don&#8217;t end up paying more pet fees than you should.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pet deposit</h3>



<p>Just like you pay a security deposit when you rent an apartment, when you rent pet friendly apartments, the landlord might want you to pay a pet security deposit along with pet fees (more on that below). Of course, this is to make sure sparky keeps his job and continues to pay rent. And also, because in the case of any major destruction (that any pet will surely cause) can be covered with that money.</p>



<p>Fair enough, right?</p>



<p>And the good thing is, just like regular security deposit, if you and your four legged roommate are well trained and leave the apartment in good condition when you move, you&#8217;ll get this money back.</p>



<p>Varied by location, the average pet deposit ranges between 40% and 85% of the rent, as per <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/dogs/living-with-your-dog/pet-friendly-housing-study/">Petfinder</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="678" data-attachment-id="13160" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/pet-fee-cost-of-pet-friendly-apartments/attachment/hamster/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hamster.jpeg?fit=1055%2C699&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1055,699" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="hamster" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hamster.jpeg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hamster.jpeg?fit=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hamster.jpeg?resize=1024%2C678&#038;ssl=1" alt="a hamster in a pet friendly apartment " class="wp-image-13160" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hamster.jpeg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hamster.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hamster.jpeg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hamster.jpeg?w=1055&amp;ssl=1 1055w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pet rent</h3>



<p>Now this is a kind of pet fees that is not refundable. Just like you pay a monthly rent for your own stay, you&#8217;ve got to pay pet rent, that can range from $ 10 &#8211; 60. However, the pet rent depends on factors such as the pet’s size, whether the property is urban or suburban, and even past personal experiences of the landlord with pets.</p>



<p>But make sure you check state laws and have this on the lease before you sign and agree to the pet rent demanded by your landlord. Good experiences = low rent, and vice versa!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="634" height="951" data-attachment-id="13161" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/pet-fee-cost-of-pet-friendly-apartments/attachment/doggo/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?fit=634%2C951&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="634,951" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="doggo" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?fit=634%2C951&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?resize=634%2C951&#038;ssl=1" alt="a pet sitting in a pet friendly apartment " class="wp-image-13161" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?w=634&amp;ssl=1 634w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So what are pet fees?</h3>



<p>While pet rent and pet deposit do account for types of pet fees in pet friendly apartments, pet fees is an additional cost that landlords charge to allow a pet to pee in their property. (oops, we mean, be.)</p>



<p>It can range from $200-500, but again, make sure to check the laws of the area you live in, and also make sure it&#8217;s on the lease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do I have to pay pet fees for a service animal?</h2>



<p>As <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/fair-housing-act-and-assistance-animals" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Humane Society</a> mentions:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Service and assistance animals are not technically pets and owners do not have to pay pet fees. The landlord, however, can charge a pet security deposit and may still seek money from the tenant if there is any damage caused by the animal to the home.</p></blockquote>



<p>Moreover, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/renters-rights-can-landlord-refuse-service-animal/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">landlords do not have the right to refuse service or assistance animals</a> under any circumstance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Under the FHA, a disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment which significantly limits a person’s major life activities. Even if a lease says &#8220;no pets&#8221; or restricts pets, landlords are required to make what is called a “reasonable accommodation” to allow pets who serve as assistance animals, which includes animals who provide emotional support.</p></blockquote>



<p>So there you have it. May you and your furry friend live happily ever after in your new apartment!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best cat breeds for apartments</h2>



<p>You might be wondering, what makes a cat breed suitable for the apartment life? Well, not all breeds are the same when it comes to cats. There are many reasons why some breeds are better suited than others. The level of activity, and the space that a cat needs, varies by breed. Some breeds also shed a lot and would be hard to clean after in an apartment. Living in close quarters with humans means that indoor cats should be friendly and tolerant too. That being said, here are some breeds you should consider, and why!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. British Shorthair</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="12874" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/cat-breeds-for-small-apartments/attachment/british-cat/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/british-cat.jpeg?fit=2482%2C1655&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2482,1655" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="british-cat" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/british-cat.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/british-cat.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/british-cat.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="black cat for small apartment " class="wp-image-12874" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/british-cat.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/british-cat.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/british-cat.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/british-cat.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/british-cat.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1366&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/british-cat.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1046&amp;ssl=1 1568w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Coat: Short</li>



<li>Weight: 6-14 pounds</li>



<li>Activity: Low to Medium</li>
</ul>



<p>Out of many cat breeds for apartments, the British Shorthair is one of the most adaptable. They are rather quiet and calm and love to lounge around and relax. This breed also needs less grooming and sheds less, thanks to its shorter coat. They are independent and entertain themselves but are not dismissive either.

<p>The Russian Blue is affectionate and curious and will follow you around, but is not clingy too. It will retreat into its own space and is independent as well. They are known for being rather reserved, and with moderate energy levels, they are adaptable to apartments. Russian blues are also loyal and will bond with one person, and can be a bit dismissive of strangers. They enjoy observing people from a distance and as a bonus, their fur releases fewer allergens.</p>

<p>The Persian is perhaps the most relaxed of all the cat breeds for apartments on this list. They are rather large and their long fur makes them super cuddly. They are not very jumpy or inquisitive and enjoy taking long naps. Persians will not climb about and explore too much either and are comfortable in smaller spaces. They are also tolerant of humans and don&#8217;t mind sharing space.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Apartment size</h3>



<p>While some breeds are less active and require less space, there should still be enough space for your cat. Make sure that your indoor cat has enough space to walk around and have its space. There should at least be some space for your pet to play around or stretch its legs occasionally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kitty Litter</h3>



<p>You may not have given this too much thought, but your cat is going to need a litter. Yes, just like you, your furry friend is going to be relieving itself regularly. This can be messy and cause an odor in an enclosed space. You will need to ensure you have space for a kitty litter and ventilation for the smells.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Storage and shelves</h3>



<p>Being the inquisitive animals they are, your cat is going to be exploring its space. While some cat breeds for apartments are less active, they will still occasionally climb about. If you have a lot of open cabinets, fragile decorations or objects, and things that can get knocked over, then caution. You want to hold off on getting yourself a cat, or maybe secure things behind cabinets with doors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Windows</h3>



<p>Your furry friend will appreciate being able to bask in the sun on a cold day. Cats also enjoy looking out of windows and watching the activity outside. Having a window is important for your furry friend&#8217;s well-being and comfort.</p>

<p>Si poco a poco te estás convenciendo de que es momento de salir de la casa de tus papás, pero no estás seguro de querer vivir con alguien desconocido, tal vez no estés preparado para vivir con roomies, así que te dejamos algunas cosas en consideración para saber si deberías vivir con una mascota, o con un roomie.</p>

<p>When comes to adopting a dog with your roommate, it&#8217;s important to be on the same page about everything. You should both want to take on the responsibility together. Especially, if you’re sharing a small apartment. Because if you&#8217;re not, the pets and the roommates will drive you up the wall. </p>



<p>But, before you get too excited about your new furry friend, <strong>make sure your landlord allows pets.</strong> There are usually extra fees associated with pets and sometimes size &amp; breed restrictions may vary too. You may also be held financially responsible for any damages caused by the dogs as you are (probably) on the lease.</p>



<p><strong>Once you’re sure you want a pet, the next step is to figure out what kind to get.</strong> This is where it gets fun!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Adopt don’t shop!</h2>



<p>Your local shelter or <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/top-reasons-adopt-pet" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">humane society </a>are good options to start your search. Not only do most breeders charge a bomb, but when you adopt from a shelter, you&#8217;re helping out a great cause. There are so many furry babies that get brought to shelters, having been abandoned and mistreated. Not only do you get an opportunity to save a life, but it’s also the more cost-efficient way to get your furry friend home! So, when you&#8217;re thinking of adopting a dog with your roommate, check out your local shelters!</p>



<p><em>Roomi tip</em>: <em>Adopting an older dog in particular usually turns out to be a slightly more feasible option for first-timers. Puppies are a lot of work &#8211; the potty training and the constant attention they need might get on yours and the roomie&#8217;s nerves.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Things to keep in mind before adopting a dog with your roommate</h2>



<p>Going to dog beaches and parks on weekends when you and the roommates are free for an hour or two is a great way to get some fresh air. (Don’t forget to wear your masks though!).</p>



<p>Getting the chance to roam free will keep your pup feeling happy and healthy!</p>



<p>Consider getting a patch of fake grass in your backyard or balcony! You can purchase these from Home Depot and attach pee-pads underneath. These are for those special days when both the roomie and you are too busy or exhausted to step out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Discuss legal ownership before adopting a dog with your roommate</h2>



<p>The biggest—and toughest—question you’ll need to figure out with your roommate is who has legal ownership of the pet. But when adopting a dog with your roommate, it&#8217;s important to have this stuff on paper. Because if it&#8217;s not, your relationship with the pets and with the roommates could be jeopardized!</p>



<p>You can agree to joint ownership, but rescue organizations typically allow just one person to be named as the official owner of your pooch, so you’ll need to agree whose name goes on the adoption papers.</p>



<p>If you choose to co-own the cutie, make sure to state this in a written agreement that lays out who gets custody once you are no longer living together. <strong>You could also stipulate who is the primary financial owner of the dog and who is the main caretaker.</strong></p>

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l2JJvTWNDyyzVdfz2" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JJvTWNDyyzVdfz2/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Write up a Roommate Agreement that covers the following:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Who’s in charge of feeding and walking the pet?</li>



<li>Are any areas of the living space off-limits?</li>



<li>Who’s in charge of cleaning up after the pet?</li>



<li>Who’s in charge of training the pet?</li>



<li>Who pays veterinary bills?</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Make a plan</strong></h2>



<p>Work together on a plan for how your pet will live in your shared space. Will you let the pooch on the couch or eat from the table? While this may be okay with you, it may not be okay with your roomi. Remember, solutions don’t always have to be black and white. Adopting a dog with your roommate means things could get a little messy, be prepared for it!</p>



<p>It’s not uncommon for dogs &#8211; especially puppies &#8211; to damage personal belongings. Remind your roommate to keep their bedroom door shut if they’re worried about their sneakers becoming a chew toy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. “Free trial”</h2>



<p>Plenty of animal shelters need foster families to take dogs in temporarily – offer to house a pet in need for a few days. This gives your roommate and yourself time to adjust to having a pet in the house and gives you both a chance to work out any issues that might arise along the way.</p>



<p>Adopting a dog with your roommate can make you feel less like strangers sharing a space together and more like family. Your pets and roommates can really make your life a thousand times better. But make sure to think it through, as spontaneous decisions can sometimes get tricky. When everything goes to plan, though, your house is going to feel more homely than ever!</p>

<p>So, your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets. You love animals, but you don’t love annoying roommates. Whether your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-late-paying-rent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate is always late paying rent</a> or they don’t take proper care of their cat, dog, budgie or iguana, it’s you who feels the impact. So, if you find yourself regularly cleaning up poop, vacuuming hairs or sharing your chicken legs with hungry pets, how can you stay sane?</p>



<p>An <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deal-roommates-untrained-pet/">untrained pet </a>leads to a messy, smelly house, and if you’ve agreed to let your roommate keep their furry friend in your home, there are certain standards they should adhere to. Remember; their pet isn’t your responsibility. So, follow these tips to make the best of the hairy situation that’s unfolding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-roommate-doesn-t-walk-their-dog-often-enough">Your roommate doesn’t walk their dog often enough</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“[My roommate] has a Maltipoo mix who&#8217;s currently 2 years old. They just moved into the place we&#8217;re currently living at about 5 months ago, and I, nearly 2 months ago. I&#8217;m not sure how she&#8217;s taken care of her dog prior to me moving in, but since I&#8217;ve started residing there, I&#8217;ve never seen her walk her dog. I voiced my opinion on this and suggested that she spend more time with him (even take him to work, as her workplace is dog-friendly). She obliged a couple times (maybe 3 times max since I&#8217;ve lived with her) and has spent maybe half a day to a full day once or twice (again, since I&#8217;ve moved in).</em></p>



<p><em>As far as I&#8217;ve seen, Sarah doesn&#8217;t play with the dog at all but she keeps him in her room with her boyfriend as soon as she comes home until the next morning when she&#8217;s off to work/wherever else.”</em></p>

<p>Your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets, and as annoying as it is for you, it&#8217;s worse for the pets. If, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/597xk5/roommate_neglects_her_dog_what_should_i_do/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit poster butwhythough1</a>, you’re feeling sorry for your roommate’s house-bound doggo, what can you do? You know owning a pet is a decision that’s not to be taken lightly. That dog needs exercise, but you no longer want to resort to walking it yourself. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-do-you-do-when-your-roommate-doesn-t-take-care-of-their-pets">So, what do you do when your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets? </h3>



<p>This sort of case isn’t illegal. Just saying your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets won&#8217;t get you very far. So unless the neglect develops into something more extreme, the NYPD or an animal control agency won’t be able to help. Instead, you’ll have to voice your concerns to your roommate. So, make him/her aware that dogs need to be walked. Provide numbers for local dog walkers if they don’t have the time. Sometimes your annoying roommates only need a guiding hand to see the errors of their ways.</p>



<p>If that’s not an option, a careful conversation should help you determine what is. If they’re struggling to find either the time or money to take care of your pet, it might be time to let go. Speak to them about finding another loving home that can give the animal the life it deserves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-roommate-s-pet-isn-t-potty-trained">Your roommate’s pet isn’t potty-trained</h2>



<p>A cat that can’t use the kitty litter. A dog that doesn’t do its business outside. Doesn&#8217;t that sound like a nightmare to live with? An untrained pet starts to really affect your own quality of life. It’s difficult to turn a blind eye when unpleasant animal scents waft their way into your nose every time you&#8217;re home. But just because your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets, doesn&#8217;t mean you need to live in a stinky apartment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9m917p/my_roommates_dogs_are_driving_me_crazy_i_dont/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit poster readoldbooks</a> had a similar experience:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“My roommate has a 1.5 year old Aussie Shepherd who constantly pees inside the house, EVERYDAY. She is taken outside every morning, around lunch, every evening, but still pees inside as soon as no one is watching her (even if I am home but in another room, she will pee on the house). She does nothing to alert that she needs to go outside. How can we train her?”</em></p>
</blockquote>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:100%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/WdIaMQ6bLlvtm" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/WdIaMQ6bLlvtm/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Your response to this really depends on your own history with animals. If you’re experienced with cats or dogs, you can guide them! You could actively help them train their pet or offer advice. If not, you’ll find training guides and videos online to share with your annoying roommates. Avoid giving in and cleaning up the mess yourself. This will just let your roomi think they’re off-the-hook and they could stop taking responsibility altogether. Bring the pee or poop to their attention immediately. And make sure the pet owner is keeping on top of any potential hygiene issues.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-the-neglect-is-more-serious">What if the neglect is more serious?</h2>



<p>The fact that your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets could be a sign of something much worse. So, if you’re witnessing serious animal abuse, you need to do something about it. If talking things through doesn’t yield the outcome you want, remember that as a cohabitant, you can report neglect. Keep a written diary of everything you experience &#8211; with dates, times and specific details wherever possible. Take photos that show the abuse. For example, take pictures of the pet and where its kept. Then <a href="https://www.aspca.org/take-action/report-animal-cruelty" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">report animal cruelty</a> to the appropriate organization. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting along with a roommate can be challenging at times, even when your personalities do complement each other. Add pets with roommates into the mix and diplomacy can break down fast. Especially in NYC, where owning a pet is harder than usual due to a high cost of living and limited accessibility to things like parks. Part of the problem is that we tend to think of our pets as just that. Ours. Our pet is our responsibility, our love and joy, our source of occasional stress. But if your current roommate or prospective roommate has a pet, then you can work together to own pets with less stress despite the challenges NYC presents.</span></p>
<p><b>Consider The Benefits Of Sharing Pets With Roommates</b></p>
<p><b>Happier, healthier pets: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even cats want a play pal sometimes. If your pet and your roommate&#8217;s pet get along, they won’t be bored when both of you are working. And a decrease in pet boredom correlates to an increase in furniture longevity. That’s just science.</span></p>
<p><b>Balance work life with pet care: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in NYC, chances are you work some crazy hours just to make rent. That can leave your pet home alone for longer than you’d like. If you and your roommate have offset schedules, you can split up pet duties. Then you don’t have to worry while you’re at work that your puppy is developing abandonment issues and tearing up your favorite pajamas in an act of wholesale retribution.</span></p>
<p><b>Save time and money: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pets are totally worth it, but they’re a lot of work, and they’re not cheap. Especially in NYC. You can get more chores done in less time if you split the workload between the two of you and coordinate. You save money by buying common items in bulk whenever possible.</span></p>
<p><b>Pet Care Action Items For You And Your Roommate In NYC</b></p>
<p><b>Balance work schedule with pet workload:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Put both of your work schedules down on paper. For each day, mark who leaves and who gets home first and second. Assign pet care tasks, like putting food in bowls and refilling water. Keep the workload even and make sure your pets are getting maximum social time with you and your roommate.</span></p>
<p><b>Buy bulk: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and your roommate should take a moment and write down every single expense your pet incurs. Then sit down together and circle the commonalities. You can buy those in bulk and split the price. If you both have the same kind of pet, you might be able to get them to agree on the same kind of food. This is easier with less finicky eaters. Like Labrador Retrievers, Mother Nature’s adorable cross between a furry canine and an insatiable vacuum cleaner. If your pets just aren’t having it, there are plenty of other expenses you can split. Wipes. Bags. Brushes. Shampoos. Litter box necessities. Biscuits. Bacon. pH balance chemicals for saltwater fish. Toys. The list goes on.</span></p>
<p><b>Tired pets are well-behaved pets:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alternate walk days and double the frequency your pets get to go outside and stretch their legs. Walking two pets at once is a good solution for smaller animals or well-trained ones. It’s not advisable for larger pets who might confuse being paired up with another animal as some kind of competition. A Husky might think, “oh hey, we’re racing now?” and next thing you know, you’re going for an unscheduled ride.</span></p>
<p><b>Merge pet cleanup with room cleanup: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pets deposit hair, splash water, and some occasionally throw up for no reason whatsoever. Instead of treating pet cleanup like a separate chore, let your powers combine and fuse pet cleanup with regular apartment cleaning.</span></p>
<p><b>Have a pet cleaning station at the door: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite NYC being a concrete jungle, pets have this uncanny ability to find every speck of dirt, every murky puddle, and track it back to the apartment. Put a pet clean up station with shared supplies right at the door to keep your apartment from being zoned by NYC as a landfill.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So, you’ve received the news that your new roommate comes as a package deal. A furry, four-legged friend. And you couldn’t be more excited! Maybe you’ve always been an <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/should-i-adopt-a-pet-in-the-midst-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animal lover</a>. And you figure having roommates with pets you can play with and not have to pay for is a pretty sweet deal. But a few weeks after settling in, you start to notice problems. Stains on your beautiful hardwood floors, the pet&nbsp;odor that just won’t go away, and hair all over the place. The cherry on top? You have a new alarm clock. In the form of barking roommate&#8217;s dog or cat meowing and scratching on the door. Here’s how you can navigate co living with pets and roommates. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Talk to your roommates with pets</h2>



<p>Like all relationships&nbsp;in life, communication is key to a successful partnership. That rule applies to the people you share a home with as well. Especially when it comes to roommates with pets. So remember that the sooner the problem of pets and roommates is addressed, the sooner it can be fixed.&nbsp;If you’re having serious issues with your furry roommate, be clear and concise about what the&nbsp;<em>exact</em> problems are.&nbsp;Use examples and avoid making generalized blanket statements.&nbsp;Here are a few places you can start:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Point out a stain on the floor and explain where it’s from.</strong></h3>



<p>Don’t attack your roommates with pets; just remind them it’s in everyone’s best interest to keep the apartment in the best condition possible so you all get the full security deposit back. (Not to mention, your roommate might have also put down a&nbsp;pet deposit).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Let your roommates with pets know that the noise is waking you up.</strong> </h3>



<p>Your roommates with pets may not be bothered by the barking because they may already be awake or even gone for the day. But if it’s disrupting your sleep, you need to say something. The pet&nbsp;could be waking up neighbors if your apartment building has thin walls. And the last you thing want is to hear from your landlord that it’s an issue. Nobody likes&nbsp;<em>those</em> neighbors, so your roommate will understand.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Avoid becoming passive aggressive.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Whatever you do, don’t leave passive aggressive notes for roommates with pets about your concerns. Pet owners are sometimes aloof to things that might annoy someone who doesn’t have an animal companion. Chances are your roommate will be happy to make adjustments so everyone can be comfortable if you’re up front about what’s bothering you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Help train the pet</h2>



<p>If things don’t get better after you’ve talked to your roommates with pets, you can try some basic training tactics yourself. Of course, how comfortable you are with this option will depend on your relationship with your roommate. If you have a roommate that doesn’t want to be friends, you may feel uncomfortable taking this approach. But if you communicate your intentions to your roommate, it’s likely they’ll be appreciative of the extra help.</p>

<p>No previous pet training experience? Veterinarian&nbsp;Dr. Amber Andersen of Redondo Veterinary Medical Center offers a few tips on how you can get your roommate’s dog to behave better.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The best general training tip is using positive reinforcement,” she says. “This is the best type of training therapy to go by. Despite what you might see on TV with some popular trainers, avoiding any type of negative or dominance based theory is ideal.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">But make sure you and your roommates with pets are on the same page!</h3>



<p>Before you start practicing any training methods with your roommate&#8217;s dog, make sure to&nbsp;get on the same page with your roommate.&nbsp;Even though you may have good intentions, remember to tread lightly around roommates with pets. Pets are like family, and your roommate may rightfully be very protective of their furry companion.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Don’t start any training&nbsp;without talking with the pet owner and making a clear plan first,” advises Anderson. “The most ideal situation is the pet is&nbsp;working with a positive reinforcement-based trainer who you can learn from together. Changes in training techniques and lack of consistency can really confuse an animal.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If this is simply too time consuming for either of you, suggest creating a budget for a pet sitter and/or training classes to your roommates with pets. Pet stores like PetSmart offer a wide variety of <a href="http://pets.petsmart.com/services/dog-training/?_ga=1.16093366.1276780955.1449525669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">affordable training classes</a> and are located all over the United States and Canada. You can also check your local pet stores for other options to train your roommate&#8217;s dog.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reach out to neighbors with pets</h2>



<p>Remember that co-living extends beyond the walls of your apartment. If you know a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/co-living-101-making-nice-bad-neighbors/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">neighbor</a> in the building has a pet, you can suggest your roommates with pets to reach&nbsp;out and see if they’re open to partnering up on walking or pet-sitting duties. This type of&nbsp;mutually beneficial relationship worked flawlessly for New York City actress Kelly O’Connor whose neighbor was happy to help.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I was living with a roommate who didn’t have time to help me with my dog which was totally understandable. One day I ran into my upstairs neighbor&nbsp;while she was letting her dog out and our dogs seemed to get along. We realized we had the same issue when it came to time and our pets, so we exchanged keys and worked out a system” says Kelly.</p>



<p>“We walked our own dogs early in the morning before 7 a.m., and I let them both out around noon before I left for the day. She had a 9-to-5 schedule while my days usually ran until about 9 p.m, so she would let them both out when she got home everyday around 6:30. It was great to find someone who had an opposite schedule from me but was on the same page about their pet being a priority. We kept this routine going for over a year before she moved. It was such a relief of anxiety and our dogs were happier than ever!”</p>
