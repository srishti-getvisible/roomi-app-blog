										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A city in Michigan, and the county seat of Washtenaw County, Ann Harbor is shaped by the University of Michigan that contributes to the workforce of medicine, technology and development. Founded in 1825, the city was named for the wives of two of the village&#8217;s founders, who were both named&#8230; you guessed it &#8211; Ann! During the 60s and 70s, the city also was a center for left-wing politics with political activism and support for legalizing cannabis. If you&#8217;re looking for rooms for rent in Ann Arbor, we cover everything about the city, the average rent in Ann Arbor, and much more in this article! Read on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Ann Arbor</h2>



<p>Ann Arbor, or &#8216;Tree Town&#8217; gets its nickname from the dense forestation of parks and residential areas. So when looking for rooms for rent in Ann Arbor, expect a LOT of greenery around, with more than 50,000 trees along the streets and even more in the parks! And, thanks to its location on the Huron River, the city has an abundance of fresh agricultural produce to offer its residents as well.</p>

<p>Ann Arbor is full of hills and valleys, with steeper terrain near the Huron River. The neighborhoods display architectural styles ranging from classic 19th and early 20th century designs to ranch-style houses.</p>



<p>Among these homes are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_house" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">kit houses</a> built in the early 20th century, as well as contemporary-style houses dotted around the city. History and architecture students and enthusiasts will be delighted to see 19th-century buildings and streetscapes of the Old West Side neighborhood that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places too.</p>
