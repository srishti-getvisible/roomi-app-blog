<p>A lease agreement is just a contract between a landlord and a tenant/renter that says how much should be paid monthly for rent and for how long. It&#8217;s a piece of paper that explains what you and your landlord have agreed upon.</p>



<p>Though it may seem intimidating due to the legal language used, but all you need is a basic understanding of what is it and you&#8217;re good to go!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How is a lease different from a rental agreement?</h3>



<p>While there isn&#8217;t a strict legal difference, in some instances, a rental agreement or a periodic tenancy may refer to a short-term rental contract. This term can be used in many contexts, but its most common usage is for month-to-month tenancy.</p>



<p>A lease agreement, on the other hand, allows the renter to lease a property for a set term, usually six months or over.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What does a lease contain?</h3>



<p>Any straightforward lease agreement will include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The terms of your rental stay. </strong>This includes your time of stay, rent amount, and additional fees you may incur. This section will also contain the requirements you need in order to stay in the house, legally.</li>



<li><strong>Rules and Regulations. </strong>Some basic rules include matters involving home maintenance, guest subletting, and pet guidelines. Not following these rules may lead to eviction.</li>



<li><strong>Legal notices. </strong>This section will include the legal terms that exist between you, your house, and the landlord. Renters’ rights, advise on lead paint, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Parking paperwork. </strong>If your lease includes an assigned parking spot, you may be asked to fill out a form identifying your car.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Types of New York Lease Agreements</h3>



<p>There are several types of lease agreements and you should know which one you need to properly manage your living situation.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Standard Residential Lease Agreement:</strong> This is the regular lease agreement between a landlord and a tenant for a residential space.</li>



<li><strong>Month-to-Month Lease Agreement:</strong> From its name, this type of lease doesn&#8217;t have an end date. It renews every month until it&#8217;s terminated by either landlord or tenant with a month&#8217;s notice.</li>



<li><strong>Rent/Lease-to-Own Agreement:</strong> This rental contract means the tenant will eventually own the property over a period of time.</li>



<li><strong>Roommate Agreement</strong>: A legal document that states all agreed rules and responsibilities of the co-tenants.</li>



<li><strong>Sublease Agreement</strong>: This document is used by a tenant to rent their place to a subtenant during a specified period.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you know what a lease is, the next step is the lease signing. It&#8217;s not anything grand, but it&#8217;s the process with a formal contract where you officially agree to rent an apartment. This agreement seals the deal between the tenant and the landlord, or representative of the landlord. This process can take place both in person or online.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. What to expect during a lease signing:</h3>



<p>A lease signing will take place after you receive the approval of your application to rent an apartment in New York. Some renters are asked to appear physically and show a guarantee of funds during the lease signing. Others are asked to sign and pay remotely or electronically.</p>



<p>Just remember that before signing anything, you should know your <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities.page" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">rights and responsibilities</a> as a tenant.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. When to expect a lease signing:</h3>



<p>A lease signing happens after the renter receives their approval based on their credit report and their financial qualifications. The schedule for this is based on whether the landlord decides to approve your application.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. What to bring with you during a lease signing:</h3>



<p>Lease signing day will be nothing if not a day filled with paperwork. The New York City government requires all potential renters to carry the following documents to lease signing appointments:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Proof of employment: </strong>Some of the most widely accepted documents for proof of employment in New York City include:
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Past two months of pay stubs (or bank statements)</li>



<li>Offer of employment letter (for new hires)</li>



<li>Income tax returns (for self-employed renters)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Photo identification: </strong>As required with any major financial undertaking, your lease signing appointment will also require you to bring along a photo ID. This would also mean carrying identification documents of any other people sharing the lease with you.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Letters of reference: </strong>While not mandatory, there are certain communities and property agents that require the submission of a reference letter before they lease out an apartment. These letters need to be signed and dated by the person writing them.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Proof of renters’ insurance: </strong>Renters’ insurance is meant to protect the renters’ belongings in the face of a natural disaster, burglary, or any other kind of damage. This is also a document that&#8217;s requested by many housing societies and dental agencies. Your landlord will let you know beforehand if this document&#8217;s required.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cheque-book, money order, or any other mode of payment. </strong>If you haven’t already paid your first month’s rent/security, this would be the day to do it. Based on your landlord’s preference, you can bring along a mode of payment to your lease appointment.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Vehicle documents/registration: </strong>Apartments in big cities, with limited parking spaces, usually assign a marked parking space to the tenants. So, expect your landlord to ask for your vehicle registration if you&#8217;re renting an apartment in New York in one of those buildings.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ask your landlord about any else that might be required. </strong>This one’s really important. A simple email or text confirming the details of your appointment can save you the trouble of having an entire day wasted over a piece of paper you forgot to carry!</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Who to bring with you during a lease signing:</h3>



<p>During a lease signing, usually only the landlord and tenant is involved. However, there are two more people you could bring with you during the process:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Your Guarantor: </strong>Yes, if your lease has mentioned a guarantor. A guarantor is a cosigner – so their signatures must also be present on the lease. Your guarantor not being present at the lease signing appointment could pose a problem, so re-schedule if need be. This of course is only applicable for in-person signing appointments.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Your Lawyer: </strong>While it’s not necessary to bring along an attorney to a lease signing in New York, some people prefer doing so. It’s frankly just a matter of preference. If you’re not comfortable signing a document without having an attorney look over it, take your lawyer along for the lease signing. If your lawyer can’t be at the venue, you can certainly request your landlord to send a copy of the lease to your lawyer.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Who gets a copy of the lease?</h3>



<p>Ideally, everyone who signed the lease agreement should get a copy of the contract. Tenants should always keep the copies safe, in case they&#8217;re required for reference in the future.</p>



<p>This is also important because some property managers charge the tenant extra to get another copy of the lease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New York Lease Agreements: Finding an Apartment!</h2>



<p>Understanding New York lease agreements for 2024 is crucial for both landlords and tenants. By staying informed about the latest regulations and requirements, you can ensure a smooth and successful leasing process. But before all of this, it&#8217;s necessary to find an apartment in New York to actually sign a lease in, and Roomi can help you out with that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University life in Atlanta</h2>



<p>While Atlanta may not be a college town, the city still has a lot to offer to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-essential-items-to-bring-to-college-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">college students</a>.

Here’s a the top five universities and colleges in Atlanta, according to USNews:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How transit friendly is Atlanta</h2>



<p>Transit around Atlanta can be a little frustrating. With six major interstate highways in the city, the traffic here can be a <em>little</em> annoying. But there are some great alternatives that’ll make your commute easier and cheaper. Here’s a brief look at all the different transit options available to you!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Walkability in Atlanta</strong>:</h3>



<p>With a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/GA/Atlanta">walk score</a> of 48, Atlanta isn’t the most walkable city in America. In fact, it’s good to have a car to run your errands. But there are specific neighborhoods, such as Buckhead and Midtown that are extremely walkable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Roads/traffic in Atlanta</strong>: </h3>



<p>Okay, we won’t sugar coat it; the traffic in Atlanta is pretty bad. In fact it featured on INRIX’s international list of cities with the worst traffic congestion. But there are ways to<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://atlantaadvocate.com/legal-guides/car-accidents/the-busiest-roads-in-atlanta-and-how-you-can-avoid-them/#:~:text=Atlanta%20is%20regarded%20as%20a,It%20is%20also%20a%20danger.)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> get around the traffic</a>, once you get to know your way around.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Taxis in Atlanta:</strong></h3>



<p>Because of the stress of traffic and the parking situation, many prefer to travel in taxis. A slightly expensive option, a taxi can be hailed easily on the street, especially near tourist destinations. Of course, Uber and Lyft are also popular options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Public transportation in Atlanta</strong>: </h3>



<p>This is the most budget-friendly way of getting around the city.  Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (<a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MARTA</a>) operates both rail and bus lines. A one-way ticket costs $2.50, making it the quickest and cheapest option. You can also take advantage of the <a href="http://itsmarta.com/Atlanta-Street-Car-Info.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlanta Streetcar</a> to travel in the city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Airports in Atlanta:</strong> </h3>



<p>The Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the primary airport in Atlanta. One of the busiest airports in the world, the airport is about 12 miles from Downtown Atlanta.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Cycling in Atlanta:</strong> </h3>



<p>Biking in Atlanta is not the most popular choice of transportation. However, the city has made considerable effort over the years to make the city more <a href="https://atlanta.curbed.com/2019/11/26/20983831/georgia-atlanta-most-bike-friendly-states">bike-friendly</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nightlife in Atlanta</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who doesn’t like the idea of moving to NYC? Empire State Building, Central Park, Broadway- it all sounds so magical! Even spending a day in the city seems like a dream come true for a lot of people. So we can only imagine how excited those people are who are actually moving to NYC!</p>



<p>I’m pretty sure all of us have dreamed of having an NYC apartment like Monica and Rachel’s but alas, the city&#8217;s real estate will not allow that. Most first-time renters, especially the ones who are young, have to settle for much smaller and cramped apartments. Unless, of course, you happen to be a multi-millionaire, in which case, please enjoy your Central Park facing NYC apartment- we’re all jealous of you.</p>



<p>But for the rest of us, finding a good NYC apartment can be a challenge, especially if you’re a first-time renter. In fact, NYC real estate is so bad that when you do find an apartment that seems adequate, you want to jump at the offer without considering much else. But that is a bad idea. As a first-time renter, you need to be careful about the choices you make and we are here to help you. Here are 10 questions you need to ask before moving to NYC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Am I moving to NYC without cell service?</h2>



<p>Let’s start with a basic one for first-time renters. When you go to check out an NYC apartment, be sure to check if your phone has good connectivity ALL OVER the house. Not just one spot. Believe me, moving to NYC without cell/data service is a fate worse than death.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can I control the heat and AC in my apartment?</strong></h2>



<p>A lot of buildings in NYC have central heat and AC. So when you’re looking at an NYC apartment, make sure you ask if you get to control the temperature of your apartment. After all, bad air conditioning shouldn’t be the thing that ruins your life in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the apartment and building&#8217;s bed bug history?</strong></h2>



<p>First-time renters, pay extra attention to this one. Ask if your building has any history of bed bugs. This is a gross problem that you never ever want to be in the middle of. You can check out the <a href="http://bedbugregistry.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bed Bug Registry</a> or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/home/home.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYC Department of Housing Preservation &amp; Development</a>, and see if your building turns up. Some NYC buildings are notorious for poor management, so keep an eye out for it.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are maintenance services available around the clock?</strong></h2>



<p>Don’t let your landlord take advantage of you because you’re a first-time renter. Make sure you ask if maintenance is available 24/7 and how quick the whole process is.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the guest policy?</strong></h2>



<p>While this will probably be mentioned in your lease, still get a verbal confirmation beforehand. Not being allowed to have guests over can be a deal-breaker for many first-time renters, so keep this in mind. After all, don&#8217;t you want to show off your new NYC apartment to your friends?</p>



<p>Also see: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/8-easy-ways-to-make-your-new-apartment-homier-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Easy Ways to Make Your New Apartment Homier</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the Pet Policy?</strong></h2>



<p>Sort of in the same line of thought as the previous one. But ask about the pet policy even if you don’t have one at the time of renting. Pets are adorable little creatures and can really make moving to NYC a lot better. You should know where your building stands on the issue of having pets.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Does it get very noisy?</strong></h2>



<p>We know NYC is the city that never sleeps but that doesn’t mean you also need to give up your sleep. Moving to NYC should not mean you end up with insomnia. It’s important to know how noisy the neighborhood and your neighbors are. This is one of the tiny things that can really improve your quality of life or completely ruin the city for you. And first-time renters- don&#8217;t be afraid to ask your future neighbors to not be loud- it&#8217;s your right! <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://untappedcities.com/2016/07/11/cities-101-nycs-noise-pollution-and-how-the-city-resolves-it/#:~:text=Residents%20can%20complain%20if%20their,moving%20furniture%20around%20their%20apartment.&amp;text=According%20to%20NYC%20Quiet%20Hours,10%20pm%20until%207%20am.)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can find out more about excessive noise control here.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who will take care of the repairs around the house?</strong></h2>



<p>Oh boy, this is a big one. Especially if you’re a first-time renter and too shy to ask about these kinds of things. If you&#8217;re moving to NYC, chances are you will need maintenance services often. So be sure to know exactly how your building manages repairs. You really don’t want your life in NYC ruined because your sink is perpetually broken.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What will happen if I break my lease?</strong></h2>



<p>I know, once you find your dream NYC apartment, you don’t even want to think about leaving it. But believe me, it’s important to know what the consequences of breaking your lease will be. You should keep that in mind and make arrangements accordingly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Does the rent go up often?</strong></h2>



<p>First-time renters can sometimes get blindsided by rent hikes because they never thought to ask about it. Most NYC apartments will hike the rent during the renewal of your lease. While this is pretty customary, you can be prepared for a hike in your rent if you know by how much it has been increasing in the previous years. If the rent hike is very steep, then this might not be your dream NYC apartment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can I find affordable housing in New York City?</h2>



<p>Start apartment hunting&nbsp;<em>a month to six weeks</em>&nbsp;before moving to NYC. Research is vital in finding cheap and affordable housing in New York. If you&#8217;re moving from another city, spend some time to look at rental postings online to get an estimate of rent, space and neighborhoods. Some great platforms to find apartments and do research are&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_rent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Zillow rentals</a>,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.listingsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Listing Projects</a>, and&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://streeteasy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Streeteasy</a>. You&#8217;ll have to do much of your apartment hunting online, because coronavirus has pretty much shut everything down. </p>



<p>You could also browse a variety of rental postings on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/547466899383959" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">private and public groups on Facebook</a>. Additionally, explore&nbsp;Craigslist&nbsp;to find sublets or rental postings, and if you&#8217;re lucky, you might even come across Rent Stabilized Apartments too! Rent Stabilized places are hard to come by, but they are great and can save you from crazy price hikes and unfair landlord behavior.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Rent stabilization is a form of rent regulation in New York that&#8217;s overseen by the New York state Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). It is different, but related to, rent control. For an apartment to be rent-controlled, the same tenant, or a &#8220;lawful successor&#8221; of that tenant (i.e., a family member or spouse), needs to have been living in the apartment continuously since 1971. No new rent-controlled apartments are created. &#8221; </em></p><cite><em>&#8211; Curbed, New York</em></cite></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s an ideal time to find affordable housing in New York?</h2>



<p>Fall and winter are the best seasons to move if you want to get affordable housing in New York! So, if you have the luxury to choose (<em>consider it!</em>), it could save you tons of money. Student internships and graduate programs start in summer, which attracts students to find accommodation in the city. This makes the New York City rental prices even more competitive. Typically, fewer people will be moving to NYC during the winters, making landlords more willing to cut you a great deal. We live in unprecedented times due to the coronavirus pandemic, which is unfortunate in all aspects except for one silver lining &#8211;&nbsp;<em>the buyer&#8217;s market</em>.</p>



<p>The coronavirus pandemic forced many residents to leave the city because of the ambiguity and large scale impact. This has led to many landlords willing to rent their apartments at a lower cost (this means we are in the buyer&#8217;s market and can essentially negotiate the price.) The coronavirus pandemic has also opened sublet options because of many students moving back home. So, a good relationship with your subletter could land you an excellent deal. Use this opportunity to stay in the city while finding your dream apartment.</p>



<p><em>Conclusion: Offseason and unpopular times mean cheaper rent.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Paperwork &amp; finances before moving to New York</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re moving to NYC, money flies. It&#8217;s advisable to plan all your expenditures &amp; paperwork well in advance before you move to the city.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi advice:</strong> <em>It&#8217;s recommend to keep your rent money separate from the rest of your expenditures.</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So how much should you keep aside?</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re moving to NYC, prepare to save at least $3,000 before renting your accommodation. That might seem a little expensive, but that&#8217;s just how much affordable housing in New York is going to cost. Depending on your needs and outgoings, this amount may vary. Still, New Yorkers (or renters in any high-demand markets) must save 3-4 months of rent before moving.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rental Structure </strong></td><td><strong>Price</strong></td><td><strong>What is it?</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Application fee</td><td>$20</td><td>A fee that all potential tenants pay to submit their applications for the landlord to review.</td></tr><tr><td>Security deposit</td><td>$2000</td><td>A good faith deposit along with the application fee. If your application is denied the deposit is refunded.</td></tr><tr><td>First month&#8217;s rent</td><td>$2000</td><td>If your application is approved, the landlord keeps the deposit and requests the first month&#8217;s rent.</td></tr><tr><td>Broker&#8217;s fee</td><td>$3600</td><td>Most broker fees include one month&#8217;s rent and 15% of the annual rent. * insert palpitations *</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Note: <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/nyregion/nyc-landlord-rental-broker-fees.html#:~:text=A%20judge%20has%20temporarily%20halted,barring%20brokers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">The New York Department of State released guidance specifying that landlords will now have to pay broker fees in New York City, not the tenants.</a> However, the landlords are the little lords of NYC, so this rule also means that the broker charge may be added to the main rent of the house by the landlord. We know finding affordable housing in New York might seem impossible right now, but hang in there! Because your dream NYC apartment is just around the corner!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s the income requirement?</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Most landlords look for 40-50 times the rent. If you are looking for a $3000/month apartment, then you must make $120,000 to qualify. If not, you must have a US guarantor that makes 80 times the rent. If you are sharing with roommates, then most landlords will combine the total.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>Sabina Sangha, Licensed Real Estate Salesperson at Compass</em></cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Apartments in New York are <strong>rented out</strong> in the blink of an eye, so as a renter you have to be on your toes to grab your desired apartment before it&#8217;s gone. Affordable housing in New York is hard to come by, so be prepared to fight for it (Not literally, of course)!</p>



<p><strong>Roomi Advice:</strong> <em>Carry your paperwork &amp; documents when visiting open houses and reach them at least 15 mins before. Because if you like a house, you need to be prompt in  submitting your paperwork and your security deposit.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Paperwork &amp; Documents </strong></td><td><strong>Personal Documents </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Proof of income: Letter of employment, offer letters</td><td>Scanned Photo ID</td></tr><tr><td>CPA letter for verification of self employment (for self employed)</td><td>Mock Application </td></tr><tr><td>Last 2 years of tax return</td><td>Letter of Recommendation : Landlord(preferably) or roommates </td></tr><tr><td>Last 2 paychecks/pay stubs</td><td>Blank checks (in case you like the department and want to give the deposit upfront </td></tr><tr><td>Last 2 months of bank statements</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Credit Score</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
