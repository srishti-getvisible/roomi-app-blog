<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-of-roomi">Pros of Roomi</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Simple and easy to use:</strong> Roomi has a free mobile app that is easy to navigate. It simplifies the roommate and housing search in Los Angeles by making it easy for people to post and list rooms. In a city where finding accommodation isn’t always straightforward, Roomi is your best option to find student housing in Los Angeles.</li><li><strong>Free room search</strong>: It is free to search for apartments on the Roomi app so you don&#8217;t have to worry about exhausting your funds digging for an apartment you like.</li><li><strong>Verified listings:</strong> Roomi pre-verifies all listed rooms to ensure you don’t fall victim to any scams. First, they verify that the person listing the apartment actually stays there. They also request interior photos of the apartment and a photo of the lister.

<p>Cost of living in LA for students requires pre-planned budgeting.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-tuition-fees">1. Tuition Fees</h3>



<p>The primary living cost in Los Angeles for students is tuition. Even within LA and its environs, tuition fees differ for different universities. Higher costs are generally associated with factors such as living out of state and attending a private college.</p>



<p>Here are some estimates of yearly LA public and private university&nbsp;tuition fees as of 2021.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>University</th><th>Annual In-state Tuition</th><th>Annual Out-of-state tuition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>USC</td><td>$60,446</td><td><meta charset="utf-8">$60,446</td></tr><tr><td>Biola University</td><td>$44,382</td><td>$44,382</td></tr><tr><td>UCLA</td><td>$13,258</td><td>$43,012</td></tr><tr><td>CSU Northridge</td><td>$7,038</td><td>$18,755</td></tr><tr><td>CSU Long Beach</td><td>$6,834</td><td>$18,857</td></tr><tr><td>LA City College</td><td>$1,220</td><td>$8,110</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>Roomi Tip:</strong> Universities in Los Angeles offer a variety of scholarships, so visit their websites to see what financial help you may be qualified for. Grants, scholarships, and work-study programs can help you further reduce the education and living cost in Los Angeles for students.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-books-amp-materials">2. Books &amp; Materials</h3>



<p>The cost of materials for each academic year is determined by your chosen&nbsp;university, major, and classes. In Los Angeles, most institutions anticipate that books and supplies will cost between $1,000 &#8211; $2,000 per year. Keep in mind that a single textbook for a semester can cost well over $200 in some cases.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-transportation-costs">5. Transportation Costs</h3>



<p>In Los Angeles, there are several&nbsp;different modes of transportation you can choose from. A weekly public transport pass costs $25 and allows you access to Metro rail and bus services. Some schools enable students to apply for transportation subsidies &#8211; a&nbsp;viable option&nbsp;if you&#8217;ve decided to live in more affordable&nbsp;accommodation, which is frequently located further away from the campus.</p>

<p>While public transit may limit your flexibility, it&#8217;s an excellent way of escaping the LA gridlock. If you prefer to drive, gas costs $3-5 per gallon, or about $100 per month. Also, remember to bring spare change for street parking, which costs $1-4 per hour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-meals">6. Meals</h3>



<p>Some universities in Los Angeles provide campus meal plans for students &#8211; e.g., USC ($2,860 per semester) and UCLA ($3,810 per semester).</p>



<p>However, arranging your own meals off-campus is more convenient and less expensive. In LA, a fast-food lunch costs $6-8, whereas groceries average $400-500 per month.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If transport&nbsp;is a major problem, consider carpooling and dividing petrol costs. The ability to cycle across the city instead of driving or taking public transport is one of the benefits of LA&#8217;s year-round sunshine.</li>



<li>Keep your student ID on you at all times; many restaurants, museums, and other businesses in LA offer student discounts. There are less expensive and healthier alternatives to eating out every night, so plan your meals carefully.</li>



<li>If you&#8217;re bored and searching for something to do, bear in mind that most public libraries also contain movies. Living like a student doesn&#8217;t have to mean missing out on&nbsp;fun, but it does need some preparation and critical thinking!</li>
