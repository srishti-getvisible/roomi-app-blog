<p>Unlike the four other boroughs, Staten Island doesn&#8217;t boast of many walkable neighborhoods. However, Saint George is a walkable neighborhood that gives pedestrians good access to nearby amenities, with a walk score of 84. Residents have commended the area&#8217;s accessibility to restaurants, stores, and more.</p>



<p>With a transit score of 74, and a bike score of 53, public transportation here is not as convenient as you&#8217;d hope, but it&#8217;s still better than some other places.

<p>The Bronx&#8217;s architectural history is rich and diverse. Plus, there are a lot of affordable areas for you to live in. Which neighborhood in the Bronx you choose will likely depend on factors like the cost of living, transportation links, and other individual concerns, e.g., schools. If you want to live somewhere in the city with a suburban feel, then West Bronx is the best place for you. This hilly region has older tenement buildings and public housing complexes in its lower-income areas, but it contains some very affluent neighborhoods as well.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot to love about the East Bronx. The community is diverse and the culture is vibrant and alive. It&#8217;s also a place where there&#8217;s plenty of connection to nature, with its lush forests, parks, and waterways. East Bronx offers residents a unique opportunity to be part of an exciting evolution from what was once one of America&#8217;s worst places to live. There are countless reasons why you would want to find rooms for rent in East Bronx. With its beautiful architecture and rich cultural history, this neighborhood has offered so many different opportunities for people looking for a new life. Here are some insights into what makes this up-and-coming neighborhood so special.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know East Bronx</h2>



<p>The East Bronx is the eastern half of the Bronx borough in New York City, located east of the Bronx River. It is mainly residential and currently has more than 2.5 million people living in it. Of late, the distinctions between the East and West Bronx are mostly ignored. Prior to the 1970s, New Yorkers thought of the Bronx as being divided into two halves, one eastern and one western.</p>



<p>Summers in The Bronx are hot and humid. However, winters are very cold and windy. And the weather is rainy and partially overcast all year long. The temperature generally ranges from 27°F to 85°F throughout the year, with temperatures seldom falling below 13°F or rising over 93°F. So, look for rooms for rent in East Bronx with climate control to stay comfortable!</p>
