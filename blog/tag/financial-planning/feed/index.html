<p>If you’re a young entrepreneur, you already know that running a business is risky. It’s the nature of the game. Honestly, that’s part of the thrill. But sometimes when you’re young, ambitious and enterprising, you might also think that you’re invincible. You might think, “<em>Of course, running a business is risky, but the worst will never happen to me! I know what I’m doing!”</em>. And while being confident is good, necessary even, it’s even better to be prepared. Especially <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-financial-lessons-to-master-under-age-30-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">financially</a>. Financial risk management, or rather, financial <em>risk</em> management can be scary to think about, but it is absolutely essential that you do. At least if you want to be successful.</p>



<p>So, that’s what we’re doing today folks! Because it’s Roomi’s job to take care of all its readers, especially the ambitious ones.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-financial-management-and-why-is-it-important-for-you">What is financial management and why is it important for you?</h2>



<p>Financial management is the backbone of every business. You cannot run a business, at least not a successful one, if you don’t learn how to manage finances well. That’s how companies go bankrupt and are forced to dissolve. Of course, that’s a risk you’re taking every time you think of running a business. However, there are steps you can take to mitigate financial trouble and avoid that very outcome. Which is where financial <em>risk</em> management comes into play. We know, all these words are enough to induce anxiety, but don’t worry!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-s-some-tangible-things-you-can-do-to-get-started-on-financial-risk-management">Here’s some tangible things you can do to get started on financial risk management-</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Identify any and all of your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.eaglebusinesscredit.com/blog/understanding-credit-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit risks</a> as soon as you can. This way you’re one step ahead of any potential disasters and can sidestep easily.</li>



<li>Avoid loans and unknown financiers as much as you can, this will really help you in the long run.</li>



<li>Make sure you pay off your outstanding debts and balances in a timely manner.</li>



<li>Make sure you have reliable payment records in place.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>See, that’s not so hard, is it?</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-golden-rule-of-financial-risk-management-have-a-plan-b">The golden rule of financial risk management: Have a Plan B</h2>



<p>We know this sounds like a cop-out, but trust us, it’s anything but! Having a backup plan is the sign of an entrepreneur who knows what they’re doing. Think about it, would you want to work for someone whose ambition has given them tunnel vision or do you want a pragmatic leader who’s thought of every possible outcome and prepared for the worst? Yeah, that’s what we thought.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/202006/bill-shapiro/pivot-plan-b-failure-strategy-twitter-slack-youtube.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">plan B</a> truly saves your business when things start going south. And trust us, things will go south at some point, that’s just how it is. But it’s all about how you recuperate from those failures that will define your career. So, get thinking about your plan B!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-all-about-the-work-work-work-work-work">It’s all about the work, work, work, work, work!</h2>



<p>So, now that you’re an entrepreneur, you really should get comfy with doing market research and cuz that’s your life now! Of course, when your business grows, you can get more and more people on-board to help you out here. But till then, this is your job.</p>



<p>Doing your market research is such an important part of the job, we can’t possibly stress this enough. How much impact your business has is directly related to how detailed your market research was. After all, a shocking <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-white/most-businesses-fail-why-investing-in-the-right-id.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">percentage</a> of businesses fail because there just wasn’t any demand for their product in the market. This market research will also help you come up with a solid and sustainable business plan. This, of course, directly helps with financial risk management and helps grow the business in the long run.</p>



<p>Incorporating data collected via <a href="https://www.uniqode.com/qr-code-generator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniqode&#8217;s QR code generator</a> also enables smarter financial forecasting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learn-how-to-weigh-the-odds">Learn how to weigh the odds</h2>



<p>By now you can already gauge how much of being a young entrepreneur is just assessing risks. Risk assessment is of course not an exact science and no one can ever precisely predict the outcome of a business decision. However, you can certainly take calculated risks while minimizing losses. When you’re starting out it can be hard to know instinctively which risks are important and which ones can be pushed aside for a while. This is where a simple pen and paper will help. Write down all the possible risks and their outcomes.</p>



<p>Once you have all the information, it’s easy to assess which ones are important and have to be dealt with immediately and which ones can be left in the back burner for a while. That’s how you come up with a proper strategy to be fully prepared. And that’s essentially what financial risk management is all about. Having a good strategy and exit plan to deal with any financial fallout in the future.</p>

<p>Handling finances is one of those aspects of adult life that no one really formally teaches you about. It’s right up there with other adulting mysteries like filing your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/guide-to-filing-taxes-as-a-college-student/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taxes </a>and deciding what to eat for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/lazy-roomi-cooking-9-recipes-for-slow-lazy-days-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner</a>. But nevertheless, it’s an important skill to have if you want to set yourself up for a good life. So, to help you get better at managing your finances, we’re going to deal with a pretty serious-sounding topic: investment. We know, we know, investing sounds like something only fancy Wall Street executives do in their high-end (pant) suits. But if you’re an adult with a source of income, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t invest. Moreover, if you’re at a stage where you want to find better ways of managing your personal finances, looking into investments is the way to go! So, here we go, let’s learn a little about investing!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-in-handling-your-finances-what-are-the-basic-types-of-investments">Lessons in handling your finances: What are the basic types of investments?</h2>



<p>If you’re new to the world of investing, everything probably feels overwhelming right now. And that’s <em>okay</em>. It will take a while before you can familiarize yourself with the different types of investment options available to you and if they’re a good fit or not. So, rather than throwing a bunch of jargon at you, we thought we’d make things a bit easier for you. Which is to say that today we’ll be looking at three basic types of investments that are best suited for beginners handling their finances. Maybe you’ve heard some of these before, maybe you haven’t. But by the end of this, you’ll definitely get a better understanding of the different options available to you and how each of these will help you in managing your personal finances! So, let’s start with the most basic one.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Financial Planning Basics: The 6 Golden Rules To Save Money</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-easiest-way-to-start-handling-your-finances-retirement-account">The easiest way to start handling your finances: retirement account</h2>



<p>You probably weren’t expecting 401(k) to show up on this list, but here we are. Investing through your employer is a great, low-risk way of handling your finances. For most employees, a retirement account is the first investment they make. Especially, if your employer matches a percentage of your contribution towards your fund. What’s more is that there isn’t generally, a minimum amount you need to contribute towards the fund. Pay whatever amount you&#8217;re comfortable with. Though it is recommended that you contribute at least enough to be able to claim the full employer match. So, if you’ve just started managing your personal finances, definitely look into retirement funds. If you already have one, great! If you don’t, reach out to HR to find out what your options are!</p>



<p><strong>Roomi tip:</strong> If your employer doesn’t offer a retirement plan (or if you’re self-employed), don’t worry! You can open an IRA account on your own. Go <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here </a>to learn more! For those interested in diversifying their retirement savings, considering different asset classes can be beneficial. One such option is <a href="https://www.pimbex.com/article/how-do-i-open-a-gold-and-silver-ira/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding gold and silver to your IRA</a>, which provides a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Learn more about the process and advantages of setting up a gold and silver IRA to secure your financial future.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fixed-income-investments">Fixed-Income Investments</h2>



<p>As the name might suggest, this is one of the safest investments for beginners out there. A fixed-income investment is generally known as a bond. These bonds allow the investor to get a fixed-rate payment over a specific period of time. Bonds are offered by both companies and governments and is one of the largest markets out there. You can actually look at bonds as a loan that you are giving out to the government or a company. And you get a specific amount of interest back, called the coupon rate, in exchange for this loan. This interest is generally paid once or twice a year till the whole amount is paid off i.e. the bond reaches its maturity. </p>



<p>If you’re planning on holding onto the bond till it reaches maturity, you don’t have to worry about your return on investment. You’ll be fine. But if you want to further buy or sell your bond before its maturity, then the market fluctuations will affect you. Just remember this simple rule and you’ll be fine- when interest rates increase, the price of the bond decreases, and as interest rates decrease, the price of the bond increases. If you’re looking for a low-risk way of managing your personal finances, we definitely recommend fixed-income investments! So, if you&#8217;re just starting to think about handling your finances better, this could be your best bet!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-equity-investments-or-stocks">Equity investments or Stocks</h2>



<p>This is probably what you were looking for when you clicked on this blog. Everyone’s mind always goes to stocks when they hear the word “investment”. Which is just as well because equity investment is great for beginners. If you’re not quite sure what they are, don’t worry, you’ve just started managing your personal finances! In a nutshell, equity investments is the buying and selling of stocks of publicly traded companies. Which means, public trade companies sell shares to investors as a way to raise capital to expand their business. In return, the investors get equity interest in the company. Some companies also offer dividends to their investors for every stock they own, which adds extra value to <a href="https://www.gainify.io/top-investors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top investors portfolio</a>, making them happy. If you’d like to research and compare the companies that pay dividends, go to <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dividend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Dividend.com</a>!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Of course, if you want to invest in stocks, you need to have an adequate understanding of the stock market. After all, if the company you’re invested in is doing well, only then can you make a profit from the stocks you own. If you’re thinking of equity investments, we recommend doing some market research beforehand. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo Finance</a> and <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morningstar</a> can be really helpful to better understand how the market is behaving and what companies you should invest in! The more you understand the stock market, the better you’ll get at equity investment. Trust us, before you know it, you’ll be a master of handling your finances!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The movie Wolf of Wall Street starring the dynamic Leonardo Dicaprio is a popular cult classic, primarily due to the outrageously true story it tells about the former Wall Street mogul Jordan Belfort. He quickly jumped through the ranks of brokers at Wall Street to attain the golden NYC dream of a large mansion and even larger bank account.</p>



<p>In the famous, catchy lyrics of rapper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy4n88CjiBY&amp;list=PLEUt5XeZei-szK0m5V4zVxjpFVRajewYb&amp;index=6">We</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy4n88CjiBY&amp;list=PLEUt5XeZei-szK0m5V4zVxjpFVRajewYb&amp;index=6" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy4n88CjiBY&amp;list=PLEUt5XeZei-szK0m5V4zVxjpFVRajewYb&amp;index=6"> Walker</a>:</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>These words accurately reflect the glorified lifestyle of the high-riding, bank account-breaking Wall Street broker. He eventually faced downfall when he became complicit in his power as a wealthy businessman, believing he could do no wrong.</p>



<p>Although the Wolf of Wall Street may have acquired his wealth through <em>ahem</em> illicit means— as all legends have their pitfalls— <strong>he left behind some key lessons on financial management that we can all appreciate.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Roomi delves deeper into the lessons from Jordan Belfort that open the door to better personal finance choices, cash flow and financial freedom.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Follow along for tips on how to save money while living in the city and ensure prime financial management, inspired by the Wolf of Wall Street himself.</strong></p>

<p>One of the primary lessons on personal finance we can learn from the film is to have a good relationship with your money. <strong>As the saying goes, the more you take care of your money, the more it will take care of you!</strong> If the numbers in your bank account stress you out and financial management feels like the hill you will die on, remember financial planning help is always around the corner.</p>



<p>Personal finance apps are a great way to keep track of your cash flow. Financial freedom is a slow and steady process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Avoid initial public offerings (IPOs) and shady investment opportunities!</h2>

<p>Jordan Belfort enjoyed the fruits of his financial scams via fraudulent IPOs (initial public offerings) and “pump and dump” schemes. <strong>It is important to remember that stock brokers or financial representatives do not keep your financial freedom or personal finances in mind when making deals.</strong> The end goal and business model for these companies is to reward the seller, more than you, the buyer. Your financial planning is your own first priority.</p>



<p><strong>If the investment scheme offers returns that seem too good to be true, steer clear!</strong> Greed leads to bad decision-making and never bodes well for financial management. When investing, take calculated risks that won’t hurt your bank account and cash flow in the long run.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Create a core set of values for your personal finance</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">

</div>
</div>



<p>Financial planning doesn’t have to be hard. Grab a journal, sticky note or write it on your mirror! Create your own personal golden rules for financial management. <strong>This could be as easy as a note on your fridge “Take out only on Fridays!” or a reminder to spend on that Starbucks drink only on the first Monday of the month.</strong> Small reminders in addition to tracking your expenses each week can help you stay on top of your personal finances and focus on keeping a regular cash flow.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Seek out new opportunities and be open to learning</h2>

Pick up the phone and start dialing! I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich! </p><cite>Jordan Belfort</cite></blockquote>

</div></figure>



<p>This is a great lesson in persistence, and being open to whatever opportunities are out there when financial management is tough and you need the extra cash flow. <strong>Don’t shy away from new jobs, or small part-time gigs that might help your bank account and gain some financial freedom.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Remember it’s okay to make mistakes!</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“If you want to be rich, never give up. People tend to give up. If you have persistence, you will come out ahead of most people. More importantly, you will learn. When you do something, you might fail. But that’s not because you’re a failure. It’s because you have not learnt enough. Do it differently each time. One day, you will do it right. Failure is your friend.” </p><cite>Jordan Belfort</cite></blockquote>
</div>
</div>



<p>Belfort experienced a major downfall when his illegal investment schemes came to light, and was ordered to repay close to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-wolf/wolf-of-wall-street-says-his-story-offers-lesson-idINTRE7930PM20111004?edition-redirect=in" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">$200 million</a> that he had earned, as reported by Reuters. He gradually helped return all the money through financial advising and business ethics lectures.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>The lesson: don’t give up on your personal finance goals.</strong> With proper financial planning, a little bit of strict financial management, it won’t be long before you stop looking for “tips to save money”. <strong>Learn from your past mistakes- identify transactions on your bank account statements where you spend the most money and rectify as you go.</strong> Don’t be afraid to set goals for yourself, and try again when you fall short. Trying your best till you succeed is the true secret to financial freedom.</p>

If you are impulsive around money when you&#8217;re young, you will likely struggle with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial issues</a> in your 30&#8217;s. Financial planning and lessons learned late in life can be costly. If you learn how to protect your savings in your 30&#8217;s (which includes getting a retirement fund FYI), you&#8217;ll make the rest of your life a hundred times easier.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s never too late to consider making sound financial decisions that you may have missed along the way. It&#8217;s essential to learn the basics of finances, whether you earn money or not. Budgeting, financial planning, and savings are useful learnings for all ages.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Financial Planning 101: Start saving</h2>



<p>You can then make your finances work for you. Find out your monthly expenditure and stick to your budget for at least three months. This way, you can build a habit and push yourself to hold on to that attitude for the year. As you consistently depend on your budget to handle your finances, you get to manage money much better. It will then help you gain clarity on your non-essential expenditure.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Start your financial planning early</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re young, it&#8217;s easy to push financial planning and financial goals to the later stages of your life (and to the back of your mind). People think that saving starts once you are secure and have a job or have many responsibilities. Nothing can be far from that as financial planning and goals begin early in your life.</p>



<p>Put that little money you have in your possession to good use. Know what you want to have, and take this time to practice essential money management habits. All habits reared at this stage of life, i.e., savings, budgeting, and living well within your means, go a long way toward shaping your life and attitude.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Beware of debt when financial planning</h2>



<p>You will require debt at some stage in life but try to have &#8216;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/12/good-debt-bad-debt.asp" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">good debt</a>.&#8217; Avoid lifestyle debts to match your friends or colleagues. Go for a small, simple car as your first car rather than a flashy one. Just because your friend wears the latest branded clothes does not mean that you should do the same. Do not let your life get derailed by other people&#8217;s lifestyles. This way, you will have room to pay for a deposit towards your house.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Protect your savings</h2>



<p>Protect your savings and link them to your long-term goals. If you have saved for emergencies, don&#8217;t touch that money unless you are in a crisis. If you&#8217;re serious about financial planning, it&#8217;s really important to have an emergency fund. It&#8217;s best to maintain a six-month emergency fund. with three months&#8217; worth in a liquid fund. It is time to be mature and remain disciplined to your savings goals &#8211; and not deviate from them just because you feel like splashing out on a new flashy watch.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Be aware of your credit</h2>



<p>Be cautious of your credit card spending, and do not cross one-third of your credit limit. Keep no more than three credit cards, and make sure that you pay off the bill at the end of the month. This way, you avoid unnecessary interest on a part paid credit.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Manage your income</h2>



<p>You might have made all the right financial plans and decisions, but you need to review them regularly. A review helps your finances align with external factors like interest rate cuts that might affect your savings. A map of your financial situation is periodically required when you move to a steady income stage and thereby reallocate the spread.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Too early for retirement fund?</h2>



<p>Your financial planning will not be complete without a retirement fund.  It&#8217;s like going to the gym regularly – some can, many can&#8217;t. When you begin to build this habit early in your life, you get stuck to it as a &#8216;normal,&#8217; just like savings. Retirement fund works the best when you are regular with it and under 30. We strongly recommend contributing towards your retirement fund.

<p>It pays to make the right financial decisions in life. Build that savings base, manage your debt, and have controlled spending patterns. A financially literate person will make better business decisions and will use the finances productively to serve their best needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Earning, saving, and spending money are pretty much universal concepts that everyone gets stressed about. Learning to manage your finances is a learning curve for many of us. Most of us associate finance management with anxiety, thinking of it like a recurring dream that haunts us when it&#8217;s time to pay the rent and bills. Sometimes stress-free accounts are what we need to liberate ourselves.</p>



<p>Money problems are also one of the main reasons people feel stuck in jobs they don&#8217;t love. Not being able to relate to the &#8216;do what you love&#8217; quotes, we soon start to realize that &#8216;early to bed, early to rise&#8217; might not guarantee health or wealth if we don&#8217;t use time and money wisely.</p>



<p>All of these factors leave us feeling like we&#8217;re in a somewhat bittersweet relationship with money. A love-hate relationship is way too common. We chase the money, but also fear it. We continuously work towards it, but we also wish we didn&#8217;t have to.</p>



<p>Although we can&#8217;t change our finances overnight, we can try changing our perspective to help us feel better about money.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/mom-season-1-episode-14-l1Et5Rt3KObESdkRy"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/l1Et5Rt3KObESdkRy/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Season 1 Leather Cribs And Medieval Rack GIF by mom - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Here are our top tips for managing finances better and viewing money in a different, more positive light (no matter how much you make).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Manage your finances the smart way: Tailor your lifestyle to suit your income</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pound ought and six, result misery.&#8221; &#8211; Charles Dickens</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The number 1 rule of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basic financial planning</a>: For instance, work with what you currently make, prioritizing peace of mind and happiness over luxury.  To manage your finances better doesn&#8217;t mean settling for less and not working towards the financial future you want. But if you are content every step of the way, money might not have so much control over your life.<a href=""></a></p>

<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/beamlyus-money-broke-beamly-ahmZvEdDoVRW8"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/ahmZvEdDoVRW8/giphy.gif?resize=300%2C166&#038;ssl=1" alt="Mel B Money GIF by Beamly US - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="300" height="166" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Keep money from slipping out of your hands</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Many people take no care of their money till they come nearly to the end of it, and others do just the same with their time.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Time and money are deemed similar in the way we use and misuse them. As with managing time, if you manage money well, you will discover you have more than you thought you did.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/nbcsunnyside-nbc-102-sunnyside-LShxFgoM623S6RgeP3"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/LShxFgoM623S6RgeP3/giphy.gif?resize=500%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nbc Money GIF by Sunnyside - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="500" height="281" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Simple tip to manage your finances: Less is more if you want it to be</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor.&#8221;</em></p><cite><em>&#8211; Seneca</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>If you can afford rent and food easily, try to celebrate that more often. However, if you keep dreaming about a more luxurious life, you might affect the <em>happiness</em> you can afford right now.</p>



<p> Be ambitious instead. Instead of dreaming of a better future, try to actually work towards it. Be patient and stress-free accounts will bless you!</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Money does not reflect who you are</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;It’s good to have money and the things that money can buy, but it’s good, too, to check up once in a while and make sure that you haven’t lost the things that money can’t buy.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>&#8211; George Lorimer</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The fact of life is that money comes and goes. What stays is who you are. But in both cases, you need to work towards it constantly to manage your finances. So while you work on your finance management skills to attain the financial future you wish to have, make sure you also work on who you are and who you want to become. </p>



<p>If you really suck at the money bit, remember that stress-free accounts are real. Help is just around the corner!</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don&#8217;t let money rob you of your joy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Let him who would enjoy a good future waste none of his present.&#8221;</em></p><cite><em>&#8211; Roger Babson</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The truth is, however much you spend your time stressing over how to manage your finances, stress alone cannot change your circumstances. So while it&#8217;s important to make a feasible plan in order to acquire and manage your finances, overthinking it will just ruin your present.</p>



<p>We might all be in different boats, but we&#8217;re struggling to sail in the same mighty, unpredictable ocean. So hold on tight to the boat of good finance management, and let your worries drift away!</p>

<p>Multiplying money is an art. We are often so consumed by our main hustle that it is difficult to think about whether or not we&#8217;re on the correct path to financial independence. Aren&#8217;t we quick to call an expert when we have a maintenance issue at home? Don&#8217;t we get our car serviced before it breaks down? Then why do we hesitate when it comes to taking outside help to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-easy-tricks-to-spend-less-save-more-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">manage our money</a> and to start investing? If you&#8217;re wondering when you need to hire a financial advisor, read this guide to find out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. You have inherited a large sum</h2>



<p>It could be a piece of property or a family home; inheritance is tricky, and you may wonder what to do with your sudden wealth. In addition, o manage your legacy, you will require the services of a fee-based financial advisor. The advisor will work through your tax ramifications and also take care of your business needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. You are unsure if you have enough for retirement</h2>



<p>Retirement should be a consideration throughout your working life. Planning for the future is as important as living your best life right now. Besides, as years pass by, it gets difficult to know whether one has enough set aside for the future. Also, a financial advisor will help you get to your goals faster.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. You feel mentally ready to start investing</h2>



<p>You have the extra savings, or your friend invested recently, and you&#8217;re inspired to do the same. With many investment options available, things can get a bit confusing. There&#8217;s real estate, stock, mutual funds, annuities, ETFs, and many other different kinds of investment avenues. In addition, a sound financial advisor can check your lifestyle, goals, and appetite for risks and help you invest correctly.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. You have a financial goal</h2>



<p>Everyone has goals, but any sizeable investment will have a big impact on your finances and lifestyle. Big goals typically require some professional help. One also needs to know whether they are making the right choices with such broad investments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. You get a fat tax refund every year</h2>



<p>You may be happy to get that tax refund check every April, but a tax advisor will tell you that it&#8217;s not fitting to leave your hard-earned money in the hands of uncle Sam, with no interest.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. You just tied the knot</h2>



<p>Responsibility for two lives is quite different from just one. There are some complex questions to think about. What happens to individual debts? Should you combine accounts? What&#8217;s the best manner to file taxes? A financial advisor will help you navigate through the best solutions for you and your beau.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. You&#8217;ve started a new business</h2>



<p>It could be very risky to start a business without professional advice. You&#8217;ll be busy focusing on the company, so consider outsourcing other important elements such as budgeting, cash flow, capital sourcing and taxes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. You are struggling to stick to your repayment</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re struggling with multiple debts or faltering with your savings plan, it is time to make an appointment with a financial advisor. Finance is tough work; did you know even financial advisors often have advisors of their own?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. You are unsure about investing</h2>



<p>It can be intimidating to start investing at first. Since there is no one-size-fits-all in investing, a good financial planner can help you create an investment that matches your goals. Investments also depend on your life stage, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iris.xyz/advisor/what-should-my-net-worth-be-at-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investments can be subjective</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. You want to feel more confident about your money</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/30-percent-of-americans-are-stressed-out-about-money-constantly.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30% of Americans get stressed continuously</a>&nbsp;about their money. Having a financial planner with you should ease that worry off your face. Sometimes our outlook on wealth completely changes for the better when you work with right advisors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As it feels as though COVID-19 has put some things on hold, you may be looking for money-saving ideas for early retirement, world travel, or just an emergency fund. But come some free time paired with the luxury of E-commerce, we just can&#8217;t help flushing our money down the online shopping drain.</p>



<p>Now, with quarantine confining us to our comfortable four walls, we have the opportunity to put all those money-saving ideas to use.</p>



<p>‘It’s not that simple,’ you say? Maybe it is if you simply give it a try! Here are some easy money-saving tips for you to take that first step towards saving.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how can I save money in the times of Covid-19?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Do some basic mathematics to cut corners &amp; increase savings! </h3>



<p>For all of you wondering &#8211; &#8220;ugh, I am a spendthrift, how will I ever save money?&#8221; Fret not! Firstly, start calculating your income &amp; expenditures by asking yourself these questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>What&#8217;s my income? </li><li>How much do I need to set aside monthly for rent, food, and other necessities? </li><li>What&#8217;s my remaining balance? <br>Secondly, ask yourself how much are you willing to set aside as <em>savings.</em> Don’t be stingy. This money is for you too &#8211; the future you! Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic is literally the perfect opportunity to maximize savings. </li></ul>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. The best way to save money is to cook at home!</h3>



<p>You know how you order in and then feel two kinds of heartburn? One from indigestion, and the other one from spending unnecessarily? Put an end to your sufferings and order in, only every now and again, to reward yourself. Don’t make working from home an excuse by telling yourself you don’t have time to cook, while you watch TV. Buy groceries with your money instead and get better at cooking to stay healthy while maximizing savings in the process. </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Save money for substantial things &gt; Online shopping </h3>



<p>You’re tired after a long day, you go online and see something that really catches your eye. You decide to treat yourself for all the hard work you’ve put in. While you might get some happiness out of it, you realize it&#8217;s generally short-lived. On the other hand, if you save that money instead, you will be one step closer to your savings goal.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Make a shopping list and stick to it</h3>



<p>This is one of those money-saving ideas that reflect changes in your bank account almost immediately. Because you can’t save everything for the future. There could be some useful things that you want but never thought you had enough money for. Make a list of such things. Put the approximate price against each item. Buy as and when you can. And try and stick to your list. You will be surprised at just how much money you can save </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Open a different savings account</h3>



<p>If you don’t understand investments and bonds, you could open a different bank account for your savings. No matter how small the amount, make it a habit to transfer some money as and when you can. Do not use the card or save the details of that card on your devices and keep it aside to work towards your savings goals. Use these Covid-19 times to minimize expenditure &amp; save more money!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial planning basics are not the long, drawn-out, intimidating, or complicated process that many make it out to be. Even if you&#8217;re one of those &#8220;what does finance mean?&#8221; folks, no fear. Financial planning is a straightforward practice that takes little time and reaps large money rewards. Whether you are a working professional or fresh out of college: it&#8217;s time to get serious with your finances.</p>



<p>Having a solid plan to manage your finances allows you to save money, afford the things you want, and achieve your long-term financial goals. Everyone&#8217;s financial planning looks different. If you&#8217;re wondering how to or why you need to create a plan for your finances, then read on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Financial planning basics rule #1: Spend less than you make</h2>



<p>Rent, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/easy-healthy-budget-meals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">groceries</a>, travel, chilling, beer &amp; shopping all require planning out your money and finances. It is a no-brainer that you need to spend less money than you earn. Unfortunately, financial planning is not easy when you have a lifestyle to keep up with. </p>



<p>When your finances drown on all fronts, it is easy to overspend. Here&#8217;s the first step. Track all your expenditures over a period to map out how you really spend money. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/personal-finance-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Budgeting apps</a> can help make this task much easier for you.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Financial planning basics rule #2: Make a monthly budget for your finances</h2>



<p>Identify your income sources and plan out your fixed expenses. Once you have a budget worked out, you have an easy path to your financial planning goals. Instead of <em>hoping</em> to save money, you can <em>start</em> saving right now. </p>



<p>When starting with financial planning basics, remember that every penny counts! You can begin putting funds towards your goals like saving for a vacation, an emergency fund, or a big spend. Challenge yourself and find creative ways to stick to your budget no matter what!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Pay off credit cards each month to effectively manage finances</h2>



<p>It is prudent to pay off credit card bills each month to avoid costly interest payments. Many people ignore the first payment and let the balance carry over to the next month. </p>



<p>You may end up paying more money in interest than on the original purchase itself. If you are unable to pay off all credit bills each month, try to make an effort to pay a little more than the minimum amount. Any payment is better than the minimum amount or no payment at all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em><a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASIC&#8217;s Money Smart</a> says, &#8220;if you make only minimum repayments to a $4,400 credit card debt, then it will take you 31 years to pay it off and cost you around $14,900 in interest.&#8221; That&#8217;s $10,500 more than the original debt!</em></p></blockquote></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Build an emergency money fund</h2>



<p>An emergency fund is an important part of financial planning basics. It is a separate savings account that is put aside for unexpected expenses. It acts as a safety net for last-minute expenses like when your car breaks down, or you lose your job, etc.</p>



<p>Since you do not know what the future holds, being prepared is the best option. With no emergency funds, you risk financial trouble as you tend to take debt (credit card) or drain on personal funds in the absence of an emergency fund. What does finance mean without an emergency fund anyway?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Get yourself insured!</h2>



<p>Insurance is your indispensable layer of protection that should be your priority. It&#8217;s like a shield protecting you financially from unfortunate life events like a critical illness or accident. With no insurance, any mishap could send your life into a tailspin. Additionally, there are life, income, and mortgage/renter&#8217;s insurance, which differentiate between a small bump or a big one.</p>



<p><em>Review your insurance every three to five years, during this time your personal assets, income, liabilities would have gone through changes.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Be consistent with your finances</h2>



<p>Strategic financial planning means consistency. You may get off track here and there; try to stick to it in the long run. Small money habits can make a huge difference in your finances.</p>



<p>Takeaways:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Financial planning is not only for the wealthy, and it doesn&#8217;t have to cost a penny. No matter how much money you have, you can start with DIY financial planning that will set you up for future success.</em></p></blockquote></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Most NYC renters are familiar with the challenges that come with paying rent on time. In between trying the city’s newest restaurants and rooftop bars, prioritizing our finances can feel like a fine art. One that can take <em>a lot </em>of discipline. And most youngsters don&#8217;t stop and think how their decisions could impact their credit score. Here’s the bad news- the ramen and the Bloody Marys are gonna have to wait. Because late rent payments affect your credit score!</p>

<p>So, what if your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-late-paying-rent/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate is late paying rent</a>, or if you’re falling behind on your own payments? Does this really have an impact on your credit score? Here’s what you need to know about sticking to the agreed-upon payment schedule.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-to-your-credit-score-if-you-don-t-pay-on-time">What happens to your credit score if you don’t pay on time?</h2>



<p>Right now, on-time rent payments don’t positively add to our credit score, while late payments can negatively affect our score. Seems a bit unfair, right? That’s why city comptroller Scott Stringer has been fighting to <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/making-rent-count/overview-rent-credit/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make rent count</a>; arguing that renters should be allowed to add rent payments to their credit history, in the same way that home owners do for mortgage payments.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>

	</div>
	


<p>While it might not seem like a big deal if you miss one or two rent payments, there could be some consequences further down the line:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-late-fees">1. <strong>Late fees.</strong></h3>



<p>If your rental agreement includes a late fee clause, then expect to part with a few extra dollars if you’re late. Check your agreement, since the cut-off time could be a few seconds, or you may receive a grace period of a day or two. Either way, aim to pay on time every month, because paying the fee doesn’t automatically clean up your rental history.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-rental-applications"><strong>Future rental applications.</strong></h3>



<p>When it’s <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-signs-time-move/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">time to move into a new apartment</a>, your future property manager will want to know about your track record. They might use property management software or might contact your current landlord, but late payments are a red flag and could get in the way of being accepted to your new dream place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eviction-risk"><strong>Eviction risk.</strong></h3>



<p>Eviction laws vary by state, but you could find yourself with a <em>notice of termination for cause </em>in your hand, signifying the start of the eviction process. In such a case, you’ll usually be given a set number of days to pay the rent in full. If you fail, you might be kicked out &#8211; which has a <em>huge </em>impact on your credit score.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-poor-credit-score"><strong>Poor credit score.</strong></h3>



<p>If your property management company reports late payments to credit score companies, your score will be impacted.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-credit-matter-anyway">Why does credit matter, anyway?</h2>



<p>Your credit score is kind of like your passport to the consumer economy; a good credit score is your ticket to securing <a href="https://www.wagedayadvance.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">payday loans</a> and mortgages in the future, when you need them most. Those with a low credit score (or missing one completely) could find themselves paying extra on their phone contracts, insurance and credit cards interest rates.</p>



<p>You could notice both short-term and long-term consequences, with late payments staying on your credit history for as long as seven years!&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can request your <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit reports online</a>, to make sure yours are looking healthy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-you-can-t-pay-rent">What if you can’t pay rent?</h2>



<p>Repeatedly missing payment deadlines is a big no-no, but we’re all human and sometimes the unexpected happens. If you expect that you’ll be short on funds for an upcoming rent payment, there are some things you can do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talk to your property manager about short-term cash flow issues. Let them know the date you can make payment (as long as it’s only a few days after the deadline). They might just be able to let it slide &#8211; just this once. Remember, though, this isn’t the case for everyone. The best approach is to create automatic monthly bank transfers, so you don’t need to remind yourself to pay every month.</p>



<p>If this is an ongoing issue and you’re struggling to pay rent more than once, it’s time to make a change. Consider taking on an extra roommate, looking for a new source of income or moving to a more affordable pad.</p>
