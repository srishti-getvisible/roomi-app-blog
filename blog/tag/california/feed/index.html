<p>Having a roommate can be awesome! From helping you to save money to becoming a good friend and making your home a more enjoyable place to be, you hit the jackpot when you find a good roomie. But when things go wrong, it can feel like hell. Unfortunately, you can’t just evict a roommate in California. In some cases, it’s not possible to do so at all.</p>



<p>It all comes down to your unique situation and what your roommate may have done. If you do have a good reason to evict a roommate, you have to know how it works. You don&#8217;t want to find yourself on the wrong side of the law, even though you&#8217;re in the right.</p>

<p>If your roommate is on the lease agreement with you, then they only answer to your landlord. Even if your roommate is not on the lease but pays rent directly to your landlord, you still cannot evict them. Even if they&#8217;re guilty of roommate harassment, the best you can do is report them to the landlord. However, your landlord can&#8217;t evict anyone without a just cause, such as causing damage or refusing to pay rent.</p>



<p>If your roommate is a subtenant (meaning you sublet your apartment out at a cost), then you can evict them. Of course, you still have to follow due process as your landlord would.</p>



<p>If you have a guest that has stayed in your apartment for more than 30 days, then they have become a &#8216;<a href="https://www.talkovlaw.com/tenancy-at-will-termination/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenant at will</a>’ and you can&#8217;t just throw them out, either.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-do-you-evict-a-roommate-in-california">How Do You Evict a Roommate in California?</h2>

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o6Mb6MYhk1fShAzx6" title="evict"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Any eviction process must begin with a written notice according to the <a href="https://www.sb-court.org/self-help/landlord-tenant/landlord-tenant-action" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenancy law in California</a>. The notice must specify how many days the tenant has until you will terminate the tenancy. If there’s a reason for the eviction, you must also specify this in the notice.</p>



<p>If the culprit had signed a written sublease agreement with you, and there is a just cause, three days quit notice will suffice. If the person has stayed with you for up to a year, even without a lease agreement, you must provide a rent notice of at least 60 days. If it is less than one year, you’ll need to give at least 30 days’ notice.</p>



<p>Either you or your agent must serve this notice of eviction, in line with the law. If you choose to evict a roommate without sticking to the roommate&#8217;s law in California, your case may get thrown out of court.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-do-i-know-if-i-have-a-good-reason-to-evict">How do I know if I have a good reason to evict?</h2>

<p>You need a good, approved reason to evict your roommate in California, but there are some ways you can get rid of a bad roomie according to the roommate law in California. If, for example, you are pursuing eviction and plan to give 30 or 60 days’ notice, you don&#8217;t need to provide a good reason. However, if you&#8217;re aiming to evict someone within a shorter time frame, then you need to be able to justify your position.</p>



<p>If you’re subleasing to a roommate, you can evict them in California much more quickly &#8211; especially if there&#8217;s a history of bad behavior. Specifically, you can evict with only three days notice and have the backing of the law to pursue eviction if your roommate is guilty of any of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Refusal to pay rent</li><li>Violating the lease agreement in any way</li><li>History of roommate harassment</li><li>Damaging the property and utilities</li><li>Disturbing other tenants</li><li>Using the unit for an illegal activity</li></ul>



<p>Make sure you have a reason before expelling anyone from your apartment. The law mandates that eviction shouldn’t be a way to retaliate or discriminate against an individual.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-if-my-roommate-refuses-to-leave">What If My Roommate Refuses to Leave?</h2>

<p></p>



<p>So you&#8217;re tired of your roommate and even after serving them notice, they won&#8217;t budge. What can you do? You certainly can&#8217;t just change the locks on the door. You&#8217;ll end up with a fine.</p>



<p>If you’re evicting your roommate for a just cause and they rectify their behavior, they can stay. For example, if your roommate decides to pay all owed rent, you’ll have to accept the rent and move on. However, if they’re still being difficult, you can move forward with the eviction.</p>



<p>In that case, if the notice period expires and the roommate doesn’t budge, you must file paperwork in court to start an <a href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/unlawful-detainer-lawyers.html#:~:text=In%20real%20estate%20law%2C%20an,required%20to%20vacate%20the%20premises.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlawful detainer suit</a> against your roommate.</p>



<p>Once in motion, your roommate may choose to respond to the court in an attempt to fight the eviction. Nonetheless, the court will set a trial date within 20 days from when you get the notification. Usually, it&#8217;s a judge-only trial. If you win the case, the sheriff will give your roommate a notice of five days to move out. If they need to stay longer, they can file a stay of execution with the court to request more time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="find-your-perfect-roommate">Find your perfect roommate</h2>



<p>Every human must be treated with dignity and evicting a roommate in California without cause just can&#8217;t happen. However, if your life is in danger, go right ahead and evict that roommate. Consequences can wait.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Garden Grove</h2>



<p>A suburb of LA, Garden Grove is in northern Orange County, California, southeast of Los Angeles. The city has a strong sense of community with roots extending far back in history.</p>



<p>West Grove Business District or West Garden Grove, was recognized as a district in 2018 and is the most affluent section of Garden Grove.</p>



<p>The east-west state highway, State Route 22, also known as Garden Grove Freeway, runs through south LA and north Orange County, passing directly through the city.</p>



<p>Here, summers are short, warm, dry, and clear, and the winters are long, cool, and somewhat cloudy. Summers are typically from July to September and winters from November to March.</p>



<p>Plus, if you love the ocean, Sunset and Huntington beaches are only half an hour&#8217;s drive away. If that doesn&#8217;t make rooms for rent in Garden Grove, CA sound appealing, we&#8217;re not sure what will!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Supportive City For Artists &amp; Dreamers</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re relocating to Los Angeles, you&#8217;ll be moving to a city brimming with artists, visionaries, and doers. All of whom contribute to the never-ending world-class entertainment options available to you every day of the week!</p>



<p>Many people living in LA pursue jobs beyond the 9-to-5, such as acting, writing, and other creative endeavors. If you&#8217;re having second thoughts about your office job and want to do something on the side, LA is a wonderful place to start because you&#8217;ll have access to a new realm of possibilities, contacts, and like-minded people.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Balanced Lifestyle</h3>



<p>LA has real respect for leisure, despite being a large and bustling city that can be rather stressful at times. From the clothes, down to the &#8220;you do you&#8221; mentality, everything appears to be more casual in LA. People in suits, and those with traditional 9-5 occupations, are not so common. This city, for the most part, promotes a healthy work-life balance, which can be quite uplifting.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Progressive &amp; Diverse Culture</h3>



<p>Los Angeles is widely appreciated for being a &#8220;melting pot&#8221; of several cultures, each of which is welcomed as a member of the broader LA community. Design, art, music, food, and so much more are all covered. You won&#8217;t have to travel far to see new locations, meet new people, and have amazing adventures.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cons of Living in Los Angeles</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Parking</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s never easy to get a parking spot in Los Angeles. If it isn&#8217;t a general shortage of parking, it is the cost, the location, the valet, the waiting, the &#8211; you get the picture. You could be in for a costly and stressful encounter. If you&#8217;re unlucky enough to misinterpret a parking notice or fail to fill the meter, you&#8217;re in for a big parking charge.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Highly&nbsp;Competitive Job Market</h3>



<p>Despite the fact that the Los Angeles job market is prospering in comparison to the rest of California and the US, finding the perfect opportunity might be tough if you don&#8217;t know where to look. Many residents of this city connect their lives with tourism and entertainment, yet it&#8217;s also the country&#8217;s largest urban manufacturing center.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re moving to LA, there are jobs available in steel, automobiles, clothes, and electronics industries. Further, employment in technology is also in high demand. There are also a number of roles in the public sector, whether you want to be a cop, a fireman, or a paramedic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. High Cost of Living</h3>



<p>Be prepared to live a pricey lifestyle, if you&#8217;re moving to LA! Housing costs are high in all attractive areas and have only continued to climb till now. The cost of living in Los Angeles is 43% more than the national average (more than 50% in some neighborhoods). To rent an apartment in Los Angeles, you&#8217;ll need more than the annual median salary, for real! However, living in LA is still cheaper than living in NYC or SF. But only by a little margin.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public Transportation &amp; Traffic</h3>



<p>One of the benefits of living in a city is that you may save money on gas and car upkeep by taking public transportation. This is a luxury that you won&#8217;t find living in Los Angeles. While the transportation system has improved over time, it&#8217;s still far from perfect.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Because the city is rather spread out, unless you live close to your workplace, you&#8217;ll inevitably have to commute during the day. This involves traveling down the notorious LA roads, which are constantly clogged to the brim.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Moving to LA for you?</h2>



<p>The pros and cons of living in Los Angeles largely come down to your own priorities. Everyone wants something different, and you can make what you want out of it.</p>



<p>But keep in mind that while LA is another large, stunning metropolis, it&#8217;s nothing compared to New York, Chicago, DC, or even Paris, London, and Tokyo. That being said, the pros and cons of living in Los Angeles do not undermine LA&#8217;s unique approach to &#8220;big city life&#8221;.</p>
