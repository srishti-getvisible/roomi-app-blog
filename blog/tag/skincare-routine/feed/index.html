										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic started, face masks have become an indispensable part of our lives. Be it going to work or a quick grocery run, masks are now at the top of our checklists when we leave home. Our lives have changed in many unexpected ways, and preventing the spread of COVID-19 with face masks is one of them. Breakouts and skin issues from wearing face masks have become so common that mask acne has even been dubbed &#8216;maskne&#8217;. As the name suggests &#8211; acne around the mouth and chin caused by wearing a face mask. Since we’re going to be wearing masks for a while, managing and preventing maskne will be our top priority! So for all you looking for maskne tips &amp; maskne treatment you&#8217;re in the right place!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What causes mask acne?</h2>



<p>Whether you’re blemish-prone or have more of a sensitive skin type, the problem is twofold: it’s both the humid conditions beneath your mask’s material <em>and</em> the physical contact of the mask itself that can cause problems. These dreaded breakouts tend to develop when pores get clogged up by bacteria, oils, dead skin cells, makeup, and dirt. This can then lead to whiteheads, blackheads, or pimples that vary in size and type.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are some Maskne tips to prevent a breakout?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Step no.1 in maskne treatment is to invest in the right mask!</h3>



<p>A cotton mask is a good option as it allows your skin to breathe while protecting others around you. Cotton is a soft, natural, and breathable fabric as opposed to synthetic fabrics such as nylon, polyester, and rayon, which are more likely to cause irritation.</p>



<p>A good fit will not only help to protect you and others from Covid19, but also prevent you from having to constantly readjust your mask. This reduces the spread of bacteria to your face and stops it from rubbing continuously against your skin.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Good skincare is a good maskne treatment</h3>



<p>A simple skincare routine can go a long way toward keeping your skin clear. Consider mask wearing a good excuse to adopt the most basic skincare routine: a gentle non-soap cleanser and a mild, fragrance-free moisturizer. Stick to a gentle cleanser and light moisturizer, and use products that are fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and oil-free. If you’re spending any time in the sun, don’t forget to use a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day. This is one of the most important maskne tips to prevent a breakout.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Break up with excessive makeup (at least temporarily!). If you put on makeup for a video call, consider taking it off when you go out.</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Wear a soft, cotton, or homemade mask that fits your face properly.</li><li>Do not touch or itch your face once you wear a mask.</li><li>Use a protective cream or a barrier cream like sunscreen or a mild moisturizer before wearing a mask.</li><li>If you’re wearing a cotton mask, be sure to wash it frequently with warm water and gentle detergent. This will help remove oil and dead skin cells that can collect on the inside of the mask.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3.<strong> Avoid reusing surgical masks</strong></h3>



<p>So, if you keep your masks clean, follow daily proper skin hygiene, and use the appropriate products, you should be able to control any skin irritations and acne while continuing to protect yourself and others from the virus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Is your skin breaking out in lockdown? You are not alone. Quarantine should technically make things easier with skin breaking out, right?  Well, is lockdown stress to blame?</p>



<p>What indeed is going on? Certainly, you are not using makeup or subjecting your skin to the stress of the harsh sun and pollution. You are also following a whole Instagram-worthy skincare regime, yet those darn angry bumps won&#8217;t go away. </p>



<p>Your girlfriends seem to be in the same fix (<em>obviously</em> not the lucky ones blessed with flawless skin&#8230; <em>ugh</em>!). Well, if you&#8217;re nodding along while reading this, here are a few reasons why skin breaking out in lockdown is still quite possible. Hint: Stress might have something to do with it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-mindless-lockdown-snacking-skin-breaking-out">1. Mindless lockdown snacking = skin breaking out!</h2>



<p>Did you buy a whole stash of lockdown snacks only to eat them all in 2 days? Definitely, guilty as charged.</p>



<p>Binge-watching and binge eating go hand in hand, don&#8217;t they? Be careful with those lockdown munchies! Not only are you devouring significant calories while stress-eating chips and baked goodies, but you may also be <a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/features/acne-foods#1](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/features/acne-foods#1)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clogging your follicles</a>, which could lead to your skin breaking out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Your body responds by cranking out more&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-types-insulin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insulin</a><em>, which increases the production of skin oils and contributes to the clogging of follicles. It can wreak havoc on your skin,&#8221; says Valori Treloar, MD, a dermatologist in Newton, Massachusetts, and co-author of&nbsp;The Clear Skin Diet.</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>When stressed, try consuming less unrefined sugar and more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Truly, you are what you eat (we all want to look like glossy donuts but it doesn&#8217;t work that way sadly).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-lockdown-stress-can-be-cause-for-frequent-skin-breaking-out">2. Lockdown stress can be cause for frequent skin breaking out</h2>



<p>We are in the middle of a global pandemic and have spent a majority of in lockdown. It can be a lot to take in for our mind, body, and soul. The increasing stress may be the last thing that you&#8217;re actually (consciously) stressing about. However, unchecked stress for long periods of time can cause a range of complications in one&#8217;s body, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/beauty/the-effects-of-stress-on-your-skin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including the confusing toll on your skin</a>.</p>



<p><em>Stress causes a chemical response in your body that makes skin more sensitive and reactive.

<p>Acne caused by wearing masks (wow, thanks 2020). Your masks can become a breeding playground for bacteria and yeast if they aren&#8217;t washed and cleaned regularly. Along with this, <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/blog/tips-to-prevent-acne-caused-by-face-masks-maskne/#:~:text=If%20so%2C%20it%20might%20be,for%20breakouts%20caused%20by%20masks." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">factors such as rubbing, occlusion, and the mask&#8217;s material can make your situation worse.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Your breath trapped beneath the mask makes the skin surface warm and moist. Besides regular acne, this environment can lead to a breakout called folliculitis, which is when yeast or bacteria infect hair follicles.&#8221; &#8211; Maryann Mikhail, MD</p></blockquote></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-healthy-practices-to-keep-your-lockdownskin-in-check">4. Healthy practices to keep your #LockdownSkin in check</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-follow-a-routine-to-avoid-skin-breaking-out">Follow a routine to avoid skin breaking out.</h3>



<p>The concept of day/night has become trivial since lockdown began. Waking up late, skipping your shower, and staying in your jammies is the new normal. </p>



<p>While it is okay to take a break and skip makeup and hair care, you should not halt your skincare routine. Follow your cleanser, toner, moisturizer, and spot treatment routine every day without fail. Talk to a skincare specialist for advice tailored to your skin type.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-get-some-sun">Get some sun.</h3>



<p>Along with this, take some time to get fresh air and sun (enjoy the sun before 10 am and after 4 pm). The vitamin D will not only benefit your skin but will also lighten your dark and depressed soul (it helps, really!).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stop-picking-on-your-zits">Stop picking on your zits.</h3>



<p>Seriously girl, staaaph!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clean-your-phone">Clean your phone.</h3>



<p>Use a sanitizer to wipe the surface of your phone, and keep it squeaky clean. You can also choose hands-free to take a call instead of slapping it on your cheek whenever it rings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-try-homemade-diy-masks">Try Homemade DIY masks.</h3>



<p>Choose ones appropriate for your skin type: what a great way to feel good!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-get-enough-sleep">Get enough sleep.</h3>



<p> Netflix till 5 am &lt; good skincare.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drink-plenty-of-water">Drink plenty of water.</h3>



<p>Your body will looove you forever!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-when-all-else-fails-stress-not-and-speak-to-a-dermatologist">5. When all else fails, stress not, and speak to a dermatologist!</h2>



<p>If your skin is just out of control, then you need to see a dermatologist. Follow all safety measures if you are planning to visit your Derma. Don&#8217;t forget to wear your mask, carry your sanitizer, and stop touching your face to keep your skin from breaking out. If you&#8217;re anxious about stepping out, consult your doc online &#8211; thank god for technology!</p>



<p>No matter what &#8211; always remember that you are beautiful! These are trying times, but they won&#8217;t last forever. Keep smiling. XO</p>
