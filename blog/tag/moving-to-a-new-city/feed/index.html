<p>So, you&#8217;re planning on <strong>moving from a house to an apartment.</strong> Now suddenly, you feel like you’re in the middle of a tsunami of checklists and you don&#8217;t know where to start. Plus, there&#8217;s even more to consider if you&#8217;re planning on getting rid of stuff. Granted, throwing things out is <em>painful,</em> but if you&#8217;re looking to save on rent and get your own pad, you&#8217;ll have to trust the process.</p>



<p>We understand the feeling of being overwhelmed with packing, moving, and all that, so we&#8217;ve made a list to help you! Here are some useful tips on downsizing to an apartment to make your move a little less difficult.</p>

<p>There are lots of things to think about before actually reaching the stage of moving your furniture in. You seriously don&#8217;t want to be stuck in the middle of a chaotic situation while moving your things, do you? Here&#8217;s a few things you can do before you make your move:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-marie-kondo-that-clutter">1. Marie-Kondo that clutter</h3>



<p>We understand how difficult it is to move once you&#8217;ve got used to living in a certain space over a prolonged period of time. People get attached to almost everything, and the contents of your home is the biggest example of that. The first stage of downsizing and moving is to declutter. So, go ahead and Marie-Kondo the clothes you never wear at the bottom of your closet. Get rid of the stuff lurking under your bed that you haven&#8217;t touched in years. You might have to shed some tears, but we swear it&#8217;ll be worth it in the end!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-take-note-of-the-measurements">2. Take note of the measurements!</h3>



<p>You may find rooms for rent with a floor plan that&#8217;s different from what you&#8217;re used to. So before downsizing to an apartment, measure everything you want to take with you. That way, you&#8217;ll know whether you need to adjust things or not. Start with the measurements of your new house, and then measure your major pieces of furniture. And the minibar? Well, if it&#8217;s a must-have for you &#8211; measure it!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-keep-your-essentials-where-you-can-easily-get-them">3. Keep your essentials where you can easily get them</h3>



<p>A lot of people overlook this point and pack everything together. But one of the best tips for downsizing is to keep some of the things you need in readily accessible boxes. It&#8217;s not a great feeling when you&#8217;re craving some food and all your utensils and glasses are packed away with the kitchenware. Also, don&#8217;t forget to keep your first aid kit within arm&#8217;s reach! You&#8217;ll never know when you need it, and it&#8217;s always better to be prepared.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-stay-calm-you-ve-done-harder-things-than-this">4. Stay calm &#8211; you’ve done harder things than this!</h3>

	</div>
	


<p>If you still have some time to spare, plan out your process of moving from house to apartment. Maybe you can move a few of the smaller pieces of furniture in for the first few days and the bigger items last. For example, you could move in a bedside table and a few chairs, then move the closet and kitchen table later. However, bringing plants in early can help them acclimatize to your new home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-use-the-stuff-that-you-keep-for-guests">5. Use the stuff that you keep for guests</h3>



<p>When downsizing to an apartment, using the stuff (especially crockery) that you usually reserve for guests can be extra helpful! This way, you can minimize the amount of stuff that you are moving, and create more shelf space!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-keep-singles-in-your-socks-in-case-you-re-strapped-for-cash">6. Keep singles in your socks in case you’re strapped for cash!</h3>



<p>Packing and moving might take a significant amount of planning and expenses, especially if you&#8217;re downsizing to an apartment. However, it&#8217;s also crucial that you have extra money to hand in case push comes to shove. Your budget should always have an upper limit that accounts for extras if something unexpected happens. For that reason, we strongly advise planning and saving up for the move.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-it-s-your-home-let-people-know-that">7. It’s y<em>our home &#8211;</em> let people know that</h3>



<p>Downsizing from a house to an apartment needn&#8217;t be dull. Whatever space you have to work with, don&#8217;t forget to add a touch of your own personal style. This will instantly make your new place feel more like home. Put up a painting. Get new planters. Paint the town red!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-use-every-single-square-inch">8. Use every single square inch</h3>



<p>This is one of the best tips for downsizing to an apartment! If you are moving from a bigger space to a smaller one, then you&#8217;ll have no choice but to utilize every single square inch. Maximize your space by doubling up the way you use it. For instance, your dresser can double as a nightstand and some stools have hidden storage compartments.</p>

<p>Ride-sharing apps have become popular around the world. And if you&#8217;re living in LA, you&#8217;re most likely familiar with Uber or Lyft. This is because roads can get very crowded and busy in Los Angeles, and most people don&#8217;t like the stress of driving. If you&#8217;re one of those people, then you want to know whether it&#8217;s better to use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles. These apps have similar features regarding their prices, mobile application usage, and safety measures. However, they do bear a few significant differences. Let&#8217;s find out what they are.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="let-s-talk-about-these-apps">Let&#8217;s talk about these apps</h2>



<p>Uber first started in 2008, through the initiative of Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick. The aim of the company was to reduce the cost of direct transportation. Since its inception, Uber has grown in its services and is available in over 900 metropolitan areas.</p>



<p>Founded in 2012, Lyft was adopted from a company known as Zimride. Lyft now operates in all 50 states in the US.</p>



<p>Uber first started out as a luxury car service. According to reviews by drivers, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Uber-and-Lyft-1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">more business people tend to use this service</a>. Lyft, on the other hand, has been described as being a more <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-general-which-is-more-trustworthy-Uber-or-Lyft" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">customer-oriented and engaging service.</a></p>



<p>That being said, let&#8217;s dive right into whether you should use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-is-uber-cheaper-than-lyft">Pricing: Is Uber cheaper than Lyft?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re living in Los Angeles, you&#8217;ve probably wondered, &#8216;Is Uber cheaper than Lyft?&#8217; These two ride-hailing apps are popular in LA, but most potential riders would prefer the cheaper option. Typically, pricing for both apps depends on demand and traffic at the requested time. Fees such as minimum fare, duration rate, booking fee, surge pricing, and more are charged by both Uber and Lyft. This means that in the aspect of pricing, Uber and Lyft don&#8217;t bear much difference.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="uber-s-unique-riders-feature">Uber&#8217;s Unique Riders&#8217; Feature</h2>



<p>The Uber and Lyft mobile apps let you see the driver&#8217;s picture before pickup, so it&#8217;s easy for you to identify that it&#8217;s the right driver.</p>



<p>Some riders prefer peace and quiet during rides, and it may be awkward if their driver is the talking type. This is why Uber has provided a feature that lets the driver know you don&#8217;t want to talk ahead of time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="booking-rides">Booking Rides</h2>



<p>If you want to choose between Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles, you&#8217;re probably looking for which one has better rides. Unlike taxis in LA, there are a lot of ride options to choose from for each ride-sharing app. However, in terms of variety, Uber tops the list. It has 13 primary services, with the most popular ones being UberX, Uber Pool, and Uber Comfort.</p>



<p>Though Lyft provides rental cars on the app, Uber wins this round as it shines in terms of its extensive services. Uber has more eco-friendly and luxury ride options than Lyft does. For example, Uber Green is a sustainable ride option that lets you request a ride in an electric or hybrid car. With UberLUX, you can request a high-end luxury sedan and ride in style.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="safety">Safety</h2>



<p>Some reviews have shown that there have been cases of safety problems for both companies. Several security measures have been put in place by both apps, such as sharing your location with a third party, viewing the driver, and vetting drivers thoroughly. However, Lyft, unlike Uber, has put in place a compulsory safety education program for its drivers. They also run annual background checks on their drivers. So, if you&#8217;re living in Los Angeles, Lyft is probably the safer option for you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="customer-service">Customer Service</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re wondering whether to use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles, then you&#8217;ll want to consider how good their customer service is. Uber and Lyft both provide customer service communication options in the form of emails, contact forms, FAQs, and webchat. There are also customer service representatives on standby for users to address issues.</p>



<p>However, comparing <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.uber.com?aspects=customer+service&amp;stars=5" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">riders&#8217; reviews</a> on customer service for both companies, Uber has the upper hand.</p>



<p>One Uber rider said, &#8220;Customer-oriented company. Thanks for your customer service.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another stated, &#8220;I recently made a complaint about an Uber driver for the first time and just wanted to note how pleased I am with the&nbsp;<em>customer</em>&nbsp;<em>service</em>&nbsp;team who responded immediately not only by email but also telephoned me to enquire further and apologize. You never think anyone takes note of these things especially complaints but this was handled perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ease-of-use">Ease of Use</h2>



<p>Both Uber and Lyft have mobile apps, and it&#8217;s easy for users to set up accounts and request rides. The apps let you choose your current location, destination, and also allow you to track your driver&#8217;s movements as they head to your location.</p>



<p>Lyft goes a step further and allows customers to sign up on a desktop web browser. They both have sleek, modern designs and are simple to navigate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="subscription-plans">Subscription Plans</h2>



<p>Uber and Lyft care for their customers and have put in place distinct subscription plans to honor their most frequent riders.</p>



<p>Uber&#8217;s special plan is called Uber Pass and grants users airport pickups, free Uber Eats deliveries on certain orders, a 10% reduction on certain premium rides, and more, for $25 a month.</p>



<p>Lyft, on the other hand, dubbed its subscription plan Lyft Pink. For $19.99 a month, users get perks like free scooter rentals, unlimited bike rentals, a 15% discount on all rides, and more.</p>

<p>Transportation in LA might not be a breeze, but apps like Uber and Lyft help to make things easier. People are different, and while some may prefer Uber over Lyft and vice versa, they are both great ride-sharing apps with different features that make riding easy.</p>



<p>So, should you use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles? If safety is more important to you, choose Lyft. If having more options available is important, choose Uber. But if you&#8217;re looking for the best deal, use both as the pricing fluctuates between the two and you can find a cheaper ride by keeping your options open.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University life in Atlanta</h2>



<p>While Atlanta may not be a college town, the city still has a lot to offer to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-essential-items-to-bring-to-college-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">college students</a>.

Here’s a the top five universities and colleges in Atlanta, according to USNews:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How transit friendly is Atlanta</h2>



<p>Transit around Atlanta can be a little frustrating. With six major interstate highways in the city, the traffic here can be a <em>little</em> annoying. But there are some great alternatives that’ll make your commute easier and cheaper. Here’s a brief look at all the different transit options available to you!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Walkability in Atlanta</strong>:</h3>



<p>With a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/GA/Atlanta">walk score</a> of 48, Atlanta isn’t the most walkable city in America. In fact, it’s good to have a car to run your errands. But there are specific neighborhoods, such as Buckhead and Midtown that are extremely walkable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Roads/traffic in Atlanta</strong>: </h3>



<p>Okay, we won’t sugar coat it; the traffic in Atlanta is pretty bad. In fact it featured on INRIX’s international list of cities with the worst traffic congestion. But there are ways to<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://atlantaadvocate.com/legal-guides/car-accidents/the-busiest-roads-in-atlanta-and-how-you-can-avoid-them/#:~:text=Atlanta%20is%20regarded%20as%20a,It%20is%20also%20a%20danger.)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> get around the traffic</a>, once you get to know your way around.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Taxis in Atlanta:</strong></h3>



<p>Because of the stress of traffic and the parking situation, many prefer to travel in taxis. A slightly expensive option, a taxi can be hailed easily on the street, especially near tourist destinations. Of course, Uber and Lyft are also popular options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Public transportation in Atlanta</strong>: </h3>



<p>This is the most budget-friendly way of getting around the city.  Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (<a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MARTA</a>) operates both rail and bus lines. A one-way ticket costs $2.50, making it the quickest and cheapest option. You can also take advantage of the <a href="http://itsmarta.com/Atlanta-Street-Car-Info.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlanta Streetcar</a> to travel in the city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Airports in Atlanta:</strong> </h3>



<p>The Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the primary airport in Atlanta. One of the busiest airports in the world, the airport is about 12 miles from Downtown Atlanta.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Cycling in Atlanta:</strong> </h3>



<p>Biking in Atlanta is not the most popular choice of transportation. However, the city has made considerable effort over the years to make the city more <a href="https://atlanta.curbed.com/2019/11/26/20983831/georgia-atlanta-most-bike-friendly-states">bike-friendly</a>.</p>

<p>Moving to a new city is always exciting, but especially so if it’s Chicago. The culture, the history, the food, the sports- everything about the city is exhilarating! But of course, moving out of your comfort zone and into Chicago is a big decision. One that you shouldn’t take lightly. Like any other major city in the world, the city has its advantages and disadvantages. You need to do your research before deciding on anything. Which is where we come in to help. Roomi has got all the info you need to know before moving to Chicago. So, read on and decide for yourself if <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/things-to-know-when-moving-to-chicago-roomi/">moving</a> to Chicago is the right choice for you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you’re moving to Chicago, be prepared for the cold</h2>



<p>Well, it’s called the Windy City for a <a href="https://www.history.com/news/why-is-chicago-called-the-windy-city" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reason</a>. The winters in the city can be brutal. So, if you’re thinking of moving to a new city for its cozy weather, Chicago might not be for you. Even by Midwestern standards, Chicago is cold. Because it’s not just the sub-zero temperature that makes it bad, it’s the wind on top of the temperature that will get to you. It might feel like days go by before you even see the sun. We don’t want to ruin the city for you, we just want to make sure you’re prepared for the reality. But if you’re someone who likes cozying up under a blanket and staying indoors, Chicago winters will be great for you! Not to mention, the summers in the city are delightful! It makes the brutal winter months completely worth-it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You don’t need a car if you’re moving to Chicago</h2>



<p>Oh yes, Chicago is a walking city! So, if you’re from <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-save-money-while-living-in-midtown-east-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York</a> (or any of these other 8 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/redfin-ranks-the-most-walkable-us-cities-of-2020-301001267.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cities</a>), moving here will be a cake walk (<em>get it?</em>) for you. Not to mention, the <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">CTA</a> is extremely convenient and affordable. Honestly, the only time you really need a car is when you’re trying to drive out of the city on a trip. And even then, be prepared for a stressful drive, the traffic is not fun. So, if you want to move to a new city with a great public transit system, Chicago is the place to be!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should you rent or buy if you’re moving to Chicago</h2>



<p>If you know anything about Chicago <a href="https://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/taxes-make-chicago-real-estate-hard-to-sell/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">real estate</a>, then you know how crazy it is out there. Which makes the city much better for renters. Not to mention, this way you can even get a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate</a> to cover half the expenses. Plus, you might want to get the feel of the city, before you decide to buy property there.</p>



<p>But even if you were looking to buy your first house, Chicago is a great city to invest in. In fact, if you’re looking for a fixer-upper, Chicago has the second most starter homes in the country. So, if you’re thinking of moving to a new city, Chicago has some great options for you, whether you’re a renter and buyer!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nothing like a Chicago beach</h2>



<p>You might not think of Chicago as a beach city, but you’d be wrong! There’s some amazing lakes in the city that you just cannot miss. There’s about 26 miles of coast along Lake Michigan and it is gorgeous. We recommend spending all your free time during the summers at one of these Chicago beaches. It’ll make you forget all about the horrors that are about to come with winters.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some beaches you have to go to:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Montrose Beach.</strong> This is the only dog-friendly beach in the city. But that’s not all. You can go kayaking, rent a cabana or just hang out on <a href="https://www.chicagoharbors.info/harbors/montrose/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Montrose Beach</a>!</li><li><strong>31st Street Beach:</strong> A very popular destination, <strong><a href="https://www.chicagoharbors.info/harbors/31st-street/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">31st Street beach</a></strong> is completely free of charge with some very fun outdoor activities available. Don’t miss it!</li><li><strong>North Avenue Beach: If you’re in Chicago, you have to go to North Avenue Beach, it’s a must. With <a href="https://www.castawayschicago.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Castaways</a></strong> at a walking distance, this beach is an iconic Chicago destination that has a lot to offer!</li></ul>

<p>Chicago is a city with a lot of different influences. So, it’s no surprise that the different neighborhoods in the city each have their own distinct personality. And if you’re moving to Chicago, you need to know about each of them, before you decide where you’re going to stay. Because, as you’ll find out, Chicagoans stay loyal to their neighborhoods!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>North Chicago</strong>: So here’s where all the young folks are at. You can find some amazing Jazz clubs walking around, or go Boutique shopping or simply catch a game. It&#8217;s a great place for youngsters to socialize!</li><li><strong>South Chicago</strong>: It’s one of the most <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-tips-for-living-with-an-international-roommate/">diverse</a> parts of Chicago.

Take all your instagram pictures here!</li><li><strong>Downtown Chicago</strong>: This is the tourist part of town. Of course, check it out when you’re just moving to Chicago, you need to do the New city stuff. But we reckon you won’t be hanging out here much after that.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The pandemic has made us all realize how important every second of our life is. It&#8217;s also made many of us re-evaluate our decisions &#8211; and reposition our priorities! Maybe taking up that fancy job actually wasn&#8217;t what you really wanted&#8230; maybe what you wanted was a life full of adventures and to move to a new city! So if you&#8217;re planning to live in a different continent, city, or country but don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re ready? Then watch out for these 6 signs that tell you that you&#8217;re ready to shift cities. If you find yourself nodding at any point while reading this, get ready for your next adventure!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. You haven&#8217;t lived anywhere else but you always wanted to move to a new city</h2>



<p>So you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s never moved anywhere else before. The chances are you either hate it&#8230; or love it &#8211; but you&#8217;re definitely wondering what else is out there. There&#8217;s definitely a certain thrill in moving cities, meeting new people, and experiencing different cultures first hand. The unknown can seem really intimidating at first, but once you get settled in a new place, you&#8217;ll probably wonder why you didn&#8217;t move any sooner!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. You&#8217;re looking to start a new life</h2>



<p>Do you have sour and bitter memories attached to the city you&#8217;re living in currently? Maybe the memories from a bad break up or an awful job role keep playing on your mind? Then it could be time to pack your bags and bid Adieu to your current town! And remember, you&#8217;re not running away from your past, you&#8217;re giving yourself a chance to start afresh.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. You want to move closer to your loved ones</h2>



<p>It could be a college degree, a relationship, or even a job that took you away from your loved ones, and now the pandemic is making you re-evaluate your decision. You&#8217;ve realized that college lessons are online, your relationship kind of sucks, and that your job is becoming a little draining. Your loved ones are waiting and your hometown is calling; can you hear it singing?&nbsp;*<em>Sings Sweet Home Alabama </em>*</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. You want a change of scene or a better quality of life and moving cities is on your mind </h2>



<p>You&#8217;re done with the city life &#8211; the booming rent, the hustle, and the concrete jungle. Maybe you want to live a more relaxed lifestyle, and you definitely don&#8217;t see that materializing in a busy city. If you&#8217;re aching to settle in a suburb, the countryside, or in a quaint town then you&#8217;re definitely ready to shift cities. Life is short, don&#8217;t exist but live it to the fullest.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. You want to explore the city of your dreams</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ve always dreamt of moving to Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York as a kid. The <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/movies-that-capture-chicago-perfectly-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movies that you watched of your favorite cities only fed your desire to start a life there</a>. Now you&#8217;re a grown-up with a job <em>(congratulations little dreamer)</em>! While adulting can be tough, it comes with many benefits like the freedom to make decisions as big as moving cities. Make your childhood dream a reality and take a leap of faith backed with financial planning and career options like a real adult!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. You&#8217;re ready to move to a new city, but can&#8217;t decide where</h2>



<p>You&#8217;re certain that you need to move to a new city, but you&#8217;re struggling to decide where. With so many amazing cities out there, it can be overwhelming to decide which one will be perfect for you.</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s what you need to do to make this process of moving cities seamless and less frustrating:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Make a list of things/experiences that you&#8217;d like in your new city.</li>



<li>What sort of weather would you like &#8211; cool &amp; pleasant or warm &amp; sunny?</li>



<li>Now mark the things which are an absolute necessity as &#8220;must haves&#8221; &#8211; this will help you narrow your expectations from a city/town/country and help you find the most ideal one.</li>
</ol>
