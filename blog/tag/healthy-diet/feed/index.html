<p>If you’re struggling to come up with meal ideas that fit your busy schedule, we hear you! Juggling life, work and the kitchen all at once is tough! Here is a list of prepared meal ideas that’ll help you cook easy healthy meals within a few minutes. Roomi has put together tasty recipes along with low carb ideas which are super healthy in nature.</p>



<p>Even if you’re not the most innovative person in the kitchen and only have limited ingredients at hand, these easy and healthy meals will guide you. Start your stress-free journey now and cook meals that require less than 20 minutes of your time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Effortless prepared meal ideas to try now!</strong></h2>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/19492210902018565/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/19492210902018565/</a>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Paleo Shepherd&#8217;s Pie</strong></h3>



<p>Don&#8217;t let the cauliflower-mash topping make you skeptical. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cookathomemom.com/shepherds-pie-paleo-whole30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This dish</a> is one of the most nutrient-rich prepared meal ideas that’ll satisfy your taste buds right away! This is a healthier take on a classic pie but remains just as comforting with hearty ground beef and tender veggies, flavored with onion, cumin, coriander, and red pepper. Sounds so yum!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Make your prepared meal ideas extra special with Asian Glazed Meatballs</strong></h3>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/238198267783828385/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/238198267783828385/</a>



<p>This dish is also low-carb and gluten free. Feel free to make a big batch of these meatballs on Sunday and stash them in the freezer. This way, you can cook them off throughout the week without having to worry that they&#8217;ll go bad. <a href="https://kirbiecravings.com/asian-glazed-meatballs-with-zucchini-noodles-meal-prep/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asian Glazed Meatballs With Zucchini Noodles Meal Prep</a> are truly a treasure when it comes to prepared meal ideas to try!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Instant-Pot Chicken Cacciatore With Zucchini Noodles</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe title="Easy chicken cacciatore with zoodles!" width="1250" height="703" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUq_Fv9_kdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>When you try different cuisines such as spaghetti, you are drifted away to the Italian countryside! Pasta is a versatile and inexpensive staple but very high in carbs. Thus, with zucchini noodles you get to taste the real essence of Italian chicken. In addition, it’s one of the most easy and healthy meals to make with mushrooms, tomatoes, and herbs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Satay Beef: One of the most efficient prepared meal ideas</strong></h3>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/54043264269589203/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/54043264269589203/</a>



<p>Some say prepared meal ideas are wholesome when there’s beef, and they’re absolutely right. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/low-carb-satay-beef-meal-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satay Beef</a> prep recipe is not short on flavor! This recipe is a cinch to throw together, and totally make-ahead friendly. However, keep in mind that the beef needs to marinate for at least 30 minutes, so plan accordingly. Serve it up with cauliflower rice and green beans for a delicious low carb lunch option.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Eat this versatile chicken with a side of veggies for dinner, and simply reheat the next day for a salad or lettuce wrap. Yes, it’s that simple! Basically <a href="https://www.aspicyperspective.com/instant-pot-chinese-sesame-chicken/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">this recipe</a> is not deep fried, so you have here one of the most easy, healthy, low carb meals. Yet, it still offers bold spicy-sweet flavors, and a deep nutty sesame note. Who wouldn’t want to try this!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healthy meals made easy with Caprese avocado salad</strong></h3>

<p>This light, refreshing prepared meal is loaded with fresh mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, basil and avocado&nbsp;with&nbsp;a sweet balsamic reduction. The prepping time is less and the salad will leave you full and satisfied. <a href="https://cafedelites.com/caprese-salad/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">This vibrant salad</a> also serves perfect as an appetizer or entrée when you are hosting a get together!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chicken &amp; Sugar Snap Pea Stir-Fry</strong></h3>



<p>Plump, shiny sugar snap peas are perfect for stir-frying, because they cook quickly and still maintain a slight crunch. <a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/spring-stir-fried-chicken-with-sugar/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">In this recipe</a>, they’re paired with thinly sliced chicken and Asian flavors for a delicious weeknight meal that comes together in minutes. And will be over within seconds!</p>
