<p>If you’re tirelessly having to ask for bill money, seeing someone have a 3-week sleepover, or wondering where the smell of cigarettes is coming from, you may have not taken the time to create a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">roommate</a> agreement.</p>



<p>Having&nbsp;roommates&nbsp;in NYC is often an&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-my-roommate-is-driving-me-up-the-wall-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">economical</a>&nbsp;necessity. Choosing the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/3-traits-look-roommate/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">right roommates</a>&nbsp;is half the battle among dodging potential creepy landlords and cat-lady neighbors. Now that you’ve settled with a few people with whom you share enough common ground to cohabitate, it’s time to team up and create a roommate agreement, to avoid any major arguments in the foreseeable future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-things-to-include-in-a-roommate-agreement">10 Things to Include in a Roommate Agreement</h2>



<p>Just as you sign an agreement to lease a rental with your roommate, you need an internal agreement too. Here are 10 things to include in a roommate agreement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-splitting-shared-expenses">#1 &#8211; Splitting shared expenses</h3>



<p>Your finances are why you chose roommates in the first place. Keep your wallet and boundaries in check by including in your game plan for when, where, and who pays up.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommates-split-utilities/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Splitting utilities</a>&nbsp;with roommates can be trickier than collecting for rent, so make sure all the details are worked out in the agreement. List the person responsible for collecting payment from everyone, the utility/company the payment is for, the exact amount to be paid, and date of each month it’s due.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#2 &#8211; Household chores</h3>



<p>Unless you’re a fan of cleaning up messes you didn’t make, household chores are a priority to include in your roommate agreement.</p>



<p>It would be wise to keep a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.care.com/c/stories/5933/ultimate-household-chore-list/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">chore list</a>&nbsp;separate from your roommate agreement.&nbsp;The chart as well as the consequences for following it should be mentioned in the agreement.&nbsp;Cleaning charts should be as specific as the bill schedule listing who does what, when. You could give the “clean up your own mess” theory the ol’ college try, but if it doesn’t workout then amend your roommate agreement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3 &#8211; Guests and entertaining</h3>



<p>Next up is one for the visitors, parents, boyfriends/girlfriends, and one-night friends. Set limitations on length of stay and details to be considered during a visit. This includes letting guests know there are house rules.</p>



<p>Here, you and your roommates can iron out a lot of other details like booze or no booze in the house, where to smoke (always outside and away from front door), and&nbsp;<a href="https://untappedcities.com/2016/07/11/cities-101-nycs-noise-pollution-and-how-the-city-resolves-it/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">noise level</a> or curfew. Keep in mind each other’s schedules, your Saturday off may be someone’s Monday at work. Not a bad idea to keep everyone’s schedules in-sight before throwing a get-together and inviting a bunch of guests.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4 &#8211; Communication styles (especially with conflicts!)</h3>



<p>Encourage open and honest communication by setting up regular roommate meetings to discuss any issues or concerns that may arise. This doesn&#8217;t have to be formal meetings with a confrontational approach, it could just be a simple meal together.</p>



<p>But when issues arise, having these regular &#8216;roommate meetings&#8217; can help resolve any internal issues you may have. Remember, communication is key! Talk about your problems and make sure that all of you are open to sorting it out to ensure a smooth relationship in the apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5 &#8211; Sharing food</h3>

<p>Discuss how you&#8217;ll handle sharing food and groceries. This could include each person having their designated shelf in the refrigerator or setting up a system for sharing expenses. But if you decide to share everything, make arrangements on a grocery shopping schedule. Or you could also arrange an inventory of all the food that you have and take turns buying food for the apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#6 &#8211; Pets</h3>



<p>Although having a pet can be a source of entertainment and happiness, it&#8217;s not all rainbows and butterflies. So, whether you or your roommate has a pet or is planning to get one, it&#8217;s necessary to include this in your roommate agreement.</p>



<p>You have to consider allergies, potty times, noises a pet can bring, and all the other factors included in taking care of one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#7 &#8211; Bathroom and kitchen schedules</h3>



<p>One of the most common things to argue about among roommates is the bathroom or kitchen times. So before any major argument arises, it&#8217;s better to include a schedule in your roommate agreement. Most especially if you have multiple roommates and just limited bathroom and kitchen space, making a schedule can help save the apartment from a disastrous morning rush.</p>



<p>To get started, make a schedule of everyone&#8217;s work or school time then figure out the order of who gets to use the bathroom and kitchen first. This makes everything more efficient and prevents anyone from being late to their schedules for the day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#8 &#8211; Moving out early</h3>



<p>Moving out should be included in your roommate agreement as it can get a bit tricky without it. Your lease may state the basics, but it&#8217;s important to have everything down to a T, like who&#8217;s responsible for what among the roommates.</p>



<p>Here, determine what steps need to be taken if one roommate decides to move out, including how to handle finding a replacement or dividing any remaining lease responsibilities. Consider these as well:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How much notice should be given before formally moving out</li>



<li>Finding a replacement</li>



<li>How to divide communal items</li>



<li>Returning the security deposit</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#9 &#8211; Quiet hours</h3>



<p>We all value our sleep, and no one wants to sleep with loud music or noises around them. So, it&#8217;s better to determine appropriate times for quiet hours to ensure that everyone has an opportunity for rest and relaxation.</p>



<p>Here, talk about who are light sleepers, who has early morning shifts, or just decide on a quiet time for the whole apartment. This could also just be a group chat message or quick chat to settle on a few hours of peace and quiet.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#10 &#8211; Violations of the roommate agreement</h3>



<p>When you sign an agreement to lease a rental with your roommate, you agree to certain rules and regulations. Failing to meet those standards can get you kicked out. Well, the same should be the case for failing to uphold the roommate agreement as well.&nbsp;While this is a seriously uncomfortable situation to be in,&nbsp;it must be done.</p>



<p>Having a roommate who doesn’t honor the roommate agreement&nbsp;can be infuriating to live with. If you&#8217;re roommate is a repeat offender, even with multiple house meetings and enough time to correct their wrong doings, it&#8217;s completely possible to ask for them to leave.</p>



<p>Clearly, someone who isn&#8217;t following the set rules is living as uncomfortably as those who prefer them. The agreement has been&nbsp;<em>agreed</em>&nbsp;upon and will result in consequences and really unfavorable living conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roommate Agreements</h2>



<p>Creating a strong and comprehensive roommate agreement is essential for a harmonious living situation in 2024. By including the 10 key elements discussed in this article, you can set clear expectations and ensure a positive environment for everyone involved. But before you can set roommate agreements, you first need to find roommates.</p>

<p>So you’re stuck coliving in the pandemic with a roommate you don’t particularly like. You have likely arrived here looking for an exit strategy from your shared apartment. Maybe a search for new apartments with roommates has already begun. Or perhaps you are at your wits&#8217; end and are now looking to escape to the depths of the Amazon forest to hide from all your problems.</p>



<p>Before the pandemic that shook our lives up, coliving in shared apartments was the trend of the decade. <strong>According to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/63-percent-of-millennial-homebuyers-have-regrets-heres-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> by the Urban Institutes Housing Finance Policy Center, only 1 in every 3 millennials under 25 reported actually owning a home in 2018.</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse">This statistic is a drastic shift from previous generations, with the total percentage of homeowners close to 8-9% less overall. It indicated a shift in the way younger folks are housing themselves.</pre>

<p>Even before the pandemic, millennials’ wallets had been shrinking. This prompted people to hunt for apartments with roommates that fit a budget as well as social needs.</p>



<p>When you consider large cities like New York, close to 40% of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/coronavirus-quarantine-relationships-conflict-roommate-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people live in shared apartments</a> with roommates. <strong>But what if your roommate is a demon who has made your shared apartment your own personal hell?</strong></p>

<p>We have all been here before, pandemic or not. Uncomfortable situations with your roommate can vary all the way from messy shared living spaces, piles of dirty dishes, to even interpersonal conflict. Whatever the trouble, it can be hard to survive in shared living spaces if you don’t like the people you are cohabitating with.</p>



<p>Moving out is often an easy and clear option, but even that has gotten trickier with the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of us have lost employment or are generally struggling with finances, making our options limited.</p>



<p><strong>If you must live on (if only to avoid moving back home to your parents), read on for some quick survival tips to keep you afloat from insanity in your coliving space.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Avoid angrily calling out your coliving partner, even if you’re mentally writing their eulogy</h2>



<p>Did you know that the United States&#8217; military during <a href="https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/Article/643229/the-american-wolf-packs-a-case-study-in-wartime-adaptation/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">World War II</a> paired submarine teammates based on how well they could support each other psychologically? <strong>It’s because confined coliving is actually the ultimate test of compatibility.</strong></p>



<p>So imagine your shared apartment as the battleground and your roommate and yourself as the submarine mates. <strong>To make coliving easier, try to hold out on your anger over small issues that might come up. If something really ticks you off, imagine your words as a wartime headline in newspapers the next day.</strong></p>

<p>Do you want the news to read, “Roommate chews off coliving partner’s head because they forgot to replace the toilet paper roll?” If that&#8217;s not the case, hold off for a bit. Take a deep breath and address the issue when you feel calmer.</p>



<p>According to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-surviving-quarantine-without-killing-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Coleman</a>, a Social Psychologist at Columbia, <strong>we need three positive encounters to every stinging remark that we make to maintain peace between both parties</strong>. So if you let that snarky remark pass off, you may need three ways to make up for the negative energy. Also, negative encounters in shared living spaces are remembered much more deeply.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Bring out the chalk, and draw a boundary in your shared apartment!</h2>



<p>Boundaries are everything when coliving in apartments with roommates. These boundaries have been blurred even more due to the amount of unstructured time we spend in our shared apartments.</p>

<p>If both you and your roommate use the living room at the same time, clashes are possible. Maybe a high-powered pilates class doesn’t go well in the background while you’re trying to concentrate on a physics lecture.</p>



<p>When physical space is limited, create structured time within your shared living spaces. <strong>If you and your coliving partner both wish to use a shared space, creating equal time blocks for use can help add a sense of separation and relief.</strong></p>



<p>Vary where you and your roommate are during different points in the day to avoid any clashes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Bonding through activities in your apartments with roommates</h2>



<p>Okay, so we previously established that your roommate is the cousin of the Devil himself. If you think there is still room to make amends in this coliving partnership, try to do low-pressure activities together that you both can reap the benefits of together.</p>

<p><strong>Examples include doing puzzles, painting, or even something simple like cooking a meal together.</strong> The pandemic may have forced the two of you into a shared living space together, but there are plenty of indoor activities to indulge in to create positive memories.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Have a clear set of quarantine rules for shared living spaces</h2>



<p>Go back to the rulebook of coliving in shared apartments with roommates. A clear-cut and honest conversation about who does the chores, who gets the couch, and for how long always helps. Especially in the pandemic, you should have clear rules about who gets to come over into your shared living spaces.</p>

	</div>
	


<p>You can even get together and write out the rules on a whiteboard and have it displayed like a constitution of your shared apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hide under the covers or behind a plant in your shared apartment</h2>



<p>When all else fails, hide under your covers if you absolutely wish to limit interaction with your coliving partner. You can simply act as if you’re asleep when you both are in the same shared living space in your home. Just pop on some earphones and breeze through TikTok videos to avoid social interaction altogether.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Seek legal support for help with the coliving struggle</h2>



<p>Sometimes we know when the final straw has dropped, and you cannot put up with your roommate&#8217;s antics anymore. On a more serious note, inappropriate behavior when coliving in a shared apartment is simply unacceptable.</p>

<p>In the early throes of the pandemic, a friend of mine faced a similar unfavorable situation with their coliving partner. This roommate accused my friend of “being romantically interested” in his same-sex roommate, eventually getting him evicted. The situation turned serious- the landlord of the shared apartment refused to return the security deposit. This came as a shock to my friend, who was accused unfairly by his roommate.</p>



<p>He took the time to find out about his rights as a tenant and ultimately filed a legal complaint against the landlord in question. If you think you are in serious danger or trapped in an uncomfortable situation, there are resources that can help.</p>
