										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After a long day of work, the last thing any of us want to do is go slog in the kitchen for a half-decent meal. I mean cooking just involves so many steps. There’s the washing, the chopping, the actual cooking, and then if that’s not enough, there’s also the clean-up afterwards. So, it’s no surprise most of us end up getting DoorDash meals most work nights. But now those bills are adding up on your card and you’re wondering if there’s anyway to make cooking easier. Well, this is where Roomi comes in. We’ve got 5 great kitchen tricks for you that will change your life. Whether you’ve never stepped foot in a kitchen before, or you’re a professional chef, these kitchen hacks will appeal to all. So, sit back and watch us blow your mind with these amazing kitchen tips and hacks!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Easy ginger trick: One of the greatest kitchen hacks</h2>



<p>Ginger is something that most of us have in our pantry. They add so much flavor to food and have so much nutritional value. Not to mention, <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-ginger-tea-3377239" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ginger tea</a> is one of God’s greatest creations and we stand by that. But for how delicious they are, they can be quite a pain in the ass. I mean, peeling ginger is one of the most annoying things on the planet. I mean, a ginger root has so many nooks and crannies that peeling it takes <em>forever</em>.</p>



<p>So, here’s one of our great kitchen tricks: Scrap the skin of the ginger with a spoon, don’t bother doing it with a knife. And wherever it gets too tough… leave the skin on. There’s no harm in consuming ginger skin, so why bother trying to get every bit of it off! Isn’t that so liberating?!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kitchen hacks for the soul: Peeling garlic</h2>



<p>If you’re like us, you want to put garlic on everything. I mean, why not? It’s one of the most delicious flavors on this planet. Honestly, we’ve never listened to recipes when they ask us to use 3 garlic cloves. It’s double or nothing for us! Which is what makes this trick one of the best kitchen tips in the world. Peeling garlic is the most boring part of cooking. So, what if we told you that you can actually peel up to 20 garlics in under 20 seconds? Sounds insane, right? But it really isn’t. Check out this video on how to do it. It truly is one of the best kitchen hacks! </p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Microwave your veggies</h2>



<p>This is one of our favorite kitchen tips/hacks ever! If you’ve ever tried to cook roasted potatoes on a Wednesday night, you’re keenly aware of how long it takes to cook them through. Cooking vegetables often takes a very long time, which can be very annoying when all you want is a quick and healthy meal. So in order to cut your cooking time in half, microwave your veggies first. Yes, it’s that easy! Place your veggies in a pot of water and then stick it in the microwave. You can do this with any vegetable that takes a bit long to cook on the stove. How long you need to microwave veggies for will vary based on the veggie and the strength of your microwave. Just make sure it&#8217;s soft when you cut into it. Yeah, it’s that easy!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of the easiest kitchen hacks: pre-cut veggies</h2>

And this is one of those great kitchen tricks that will finish off all the trouble that comes with cooking veggies. BUY PRE-CUT VEGGIES. It will absolutely change your life. Between these two kitchen tips, this one and the microwave one, you’re going to cut down your cooking time to under 10 minutes. Isn’t that amazing?! So, the next time you go to the grocery store, don’t even bother with whole veggies.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Weekly Meal Preps </h2>



<p>Okay, we’d all like to be one of those people who work the whole day and then come back home and cook to relax. That would be amazing. But most of us don’t have the patience for it and that’s okay! So, what you can do is do a weekly meal prep. Cook maybe twice a week when your schedule is light and then eat those meals through the week. </p>

I mean, how many times have you stood in the middle of your kitchen and wondered what the hell you should cook for dinner? Well, meal prep takes care of that problem. Just cook your <a href="https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/how-to-meal-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meals</a> beforehand and then have a stress free week!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Who are you rooting for?</h2>



<p>Well, we are rooting for freezers as they are a great way to store fresh ginger esp. when you&#8217;re done grating it. Just freeze the leftover root in a plastic container to avoid stray shriveled ginger across your fridge.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Make foamy milk without a frother at home! (#1 on ingenious kitchen hacks you didn&#8217;t think you needed, but do now)</h2>



<p>So what you don&#8217;t own a fancy-schmancy espresso machine with an attached milk steamer? Honestly, all you need is a small glass jar with a lid. Fill the jar halfway with milk and shake it off Taylor Swift style until the jar contents have doubled in size. Now pop in the microwave for 30 seconds to enjoy the frothy goodness. You&#8217;re welcome!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Hacks to save time &#8211; Make herbs last longer</h2>



<p>What&#8217;s worse than buying fresh herbs in bulk &#8211; to see them wilt and die the very next day. Store herbs like parsley &amp; cilantro properly with this cool storage tip! Trim the stems and place the herbs in a small glass of water. Cover the herbs with a plastic/grocery bag and secure by tying the plastic in a knot. Store in the fridge or on the counter for up to two weeks!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Hull strawberries without squishing them</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Who&#8217;s a firefighter?</h2>



<p>You are! Accidents happen in the kitchen all the time. So you were doing a fancy flip and now your oil-soaked stir fry is on fire &#8211;&nbsp;<em>it happens!</em>&nbsp;Before you abandon the pan to save your life or call your roomi for help, try this hack. By no means add water to a fire caused by oil &#8211; it will only make it worse. Instead, sprinkle baking soda onto a small grease or electrical fire to extinguish the flames. When heated, baking soda releases carbon dioxide, which helps to kill the fire.</p>
