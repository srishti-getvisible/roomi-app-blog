<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Summer in full swing, it’s time for flip-flops, shorts, and sleep deprivation. If the sweltering heat is keeping you awake at night, rest easy knowing that relief is on the way. Take a look at three of the best ways to survive the summer in <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/a-guide-to-the-abundant-outdoors-of-new-york-part-1/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">N</a><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/a-guide-to-the-abundant-outdoors-of-new-york-part-1/">YC</a> and plan a trip with your roommate to cool down.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Spend the summer in NYC in the free pools</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC has</span><a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/outdoor-pools" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">free pools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all five boroughs. The Astoria Pool is often reputed to</span><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/best-ny-astoria-pool-best-public-pool-article-1.157502" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">be one of the absolute best</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s pretty epic. At 350 square feet, it’s the largest swimming pool in America. Also, </span>contrary to popular belief, it&#8217;s actually quite clean. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a heads up, there can be a wait on hot days.</span> Show up around midday and just relax. Just remember to grab an umbrella. It&#8217;s a lovely way to spend a summer afternoon in NYC. </p>



<p>But f<span style="font-weight: 400;">or something a little different, try the</span><a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/barretto-point-park/facilities/outdoor-pools/floating-pool" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">floating pool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Barretto Point Park.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a r</span>eally fun <span style="font-weight: 400;">experience</span> that&#8217;ll stay with you.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> M</span>oreover, you can also brag about it the next day to your friends who weren&#8217;t as lucky as you. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Chill out in a cryosauna</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s hot enough, then being in temperatures that plunge down to -240 F doesn’t sound so crazy anymore. The company</span><a href="https://www.kryolifehealth.com/cryo-nyc-info/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kryolife</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a cryosauna service that subjects your body to cryogenic temperatures for 2-3 minutes. Y</span>ou can follow it up with some light cardiovascular activity, if you&#8217;d like. You can use it as a way to cool off but athletes generally use it to recover from strenuous workouts. <span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because it releases toxins, replenishes oxygen, and renews your energy over a 48 hour period after you’ve done your imitation of a human popsicle. That’s just a joke, the liquid nitrogen used to control the temp never actually touches your skin. If you’ve got questions about how cryotherapy works, check out their FAQ section</span><a href="https://www.kryolifehealth.com/krolife-cryotherapy-faq/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> So, give this a shot the next time summer in NYC gets too much for you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Go to the coolest bar in town.</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Minus 5 Ice Bar is made entirely of, you guessed it, ice. Like, the whole thing. Chandeliers. Seats. Even the glasses you drink out of. Ice sculptures are always on display and perpetually under revision, so you never know what you and your roommate will get the chance to see. The light show is built in to the frosty spectacle, and they’ve got music going, so it provides a warm ambience that compliments the frozen interior nicely. While there is more than one Minus 5, the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New York location is inside the lobby of the New York Hilton Midtown in downtown Manhattan.</span> So it is literally a dream come true for most of us trying to live through summer in NYC. </p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York in the summer can be a lot of fun, but let’s face it</span>, people can get a little cranky when it&#8217;s hot. Especially after they spent the whole day blistering under the sun. <span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you find yourself asking work for a transfer to Antarctica, take a deep breath and try one of the three best ways to survive the summer in NYC instead. You and your roommate could be sipping frozen cocktails from stylish glasses sculpted out of pure ice</span>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s. So. Hot.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your sweat hisses when it hits the sidewalk in the heat of the summer. Pigeons lay in the shade at the parks. You’re pretty sure you just saw a cockroach wearing a straw hat, sunglasses, and a Hawaiian t-shirt carrying a miniature suitcase down into the sewers.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, that last bit may have been a heat-induced hallucination. But then again, it’s <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-tips-on-how-to-save-money-while-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a>. Anything could happen.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">And the worst part of it all? You&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s this hot.</span> All the hot tips on the internet tell you moving in the summer is a <em>bad idea</em>. But here you are..</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s enough to make a perfectly grown adult throw a temper tantrum, but that would involve way too much flailing around for these kinds of conditions. It’s an especially bad idea if your apartment has hardwood floors instead of carpets.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here are a few tips from the </span><a href="https://roomiapp.com" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roomi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team to stay cool when you find yourself moving when it’s hot.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Timing is everything</b> when you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An old bit of advice that still holds true today. And probably forever. Schedule moving for early in the morning or late in the evening when the heat is at its least miserable. If you have a choice between the two, always do it early.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, getting up early is a giant pain in the butt. But moving day almost never goes as planned. If things go awry, but you got an early start, you’ll have more time to fix it. Also, the</span><a href="http://www.almanac.com/fact/what-is-the-hottest-time-of-dayr" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">hottest point in the day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is typically 3 pm, not noon. So you’ve got more cool hours to work with early in the morning that don’t involve stumbling around narrow metal staircases in the dark. Farmers get up at the crack of dawn for a good reason, as it turns out.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Hydrat</b>ion is key if you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot </h2>



<p>One of the best tips we can give you for moving in the heat of the summer  is this: <strong>hydration is extremely important</strong>. <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of different opinions on how much water you should drink in a day. There isn’t a hard and fast rule that everyone can agree on. But according to</span><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this popular article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the fluid intake for guys is about 3 liters per day and gals is around 2.2 liters per day. The word fluid didn’t slip in by accident. Lots of beverages contain water and can count towards your hydration efforts. But keep in mind that moving is tough, sweaty work and you’re doing it in conditions that would make a camel wince. So it’s a good idea to drink extra beverages if you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And by the way, slamming a six pack of Bud Light then wrestling a couch up a flight of stairs is so not a good idea. So don’t let anyone on your moving team get too crazy with their interpretation of “beverages.”</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Use utilities to your advantage.</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wherever you’re moving to, have the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommates-split-utilities/">utilities</a> turned on and ready to go before you get there. If you’ve got an AC at the new place, the apartment can be cool as you move in. You might be tempted to save some money and turn off the utilities at your current residence on move out day. Understandable. But if you can keep them going for one more day, you can run the AC at your place while you pack. Even if you don’t have AC, you can run fans. And more importantly, the fridge (you&#8217;re fridge will be your life saver if you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot). Which brings us to our final piece of advice.</span></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Cool, damp towels are your new best friend.</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cold, damp towel that’s been hanging out in the fridge can feel like pure ecstasy after a long day of moving when it&#8217;s hot. Maybe you can </span>even <span style="font-weight: 400;">stick it under a hat, so it covers your head and hangs down over the back of your neck through t</span>he day<span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don’t have power to the fridge, then cool water will still work wonders.</span></p>
