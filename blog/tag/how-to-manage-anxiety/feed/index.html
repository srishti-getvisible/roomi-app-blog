However, unmanaged stress and anxiety can cause some real-time damage to your mind and body. This is why we are here to teach you how to manage anxiety and stress when you can feel yourself struggling. Stress about the Coronavirus pandemic is real, so don&#8217;t try to pretend to be okay. Instead, try this!</p>

<p>If a book named &#8216;How To Manage Your Raging Coronavirus Anxiety&#8217; existed, building a routine would be the first chapter. Here&#8217;s what the experts say about the importance of a routine:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Your daily routine influences your quality of rest.

<p>There&#8217;s nothing a good workout can&#8217;t beat esp. when you can&#8217;t help but stress about the coronavirus pandemic.

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;Gazing deep into your dog&#8217;s eyes releases &#8216;Oxytocin&#8217; in both you and your pet. Which can not only make you happier but also help you combat stress and anxiety effectively. Isn&#8217;t that the cutest?</p>

<p>When the world feels like a desolate place, and everything seems meaningless, believe in someone greater than yourself. It&#8217;s the coronavirus pandemic and some of the best minds on the whole of the earth are struggling to find a way out of it, so if you&#8217;re religious, this is a great time to turn to your faith. If not, take some time out of every day to meditate &#8211; it can feel strange at first, but stick at it to experience the calming benefits.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>And Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</em></p><cite>&#8211; Mark 11:22-24</cite></blockquote>

<p>This may seem obvious, but people just aren&#8217;t reconnecting enough right now. People suffering from long-term stress and anxiety seem to shut themselves out fearing that their friends and family won&#8217;t understand them. It&#8217;s extremely challenging for them to manage their anxiety &#8211; even the most menial tasks become cumbersome.</p>



<p>So having a close-knit circle of friends to talk with, is the most comforting experience at this time. If you, or someone you know is battling anxiety, be sure to seek or extend comfort. Let&#8217;s all be there for each other and help manage the raging stress &amp; anxiety that most of us are overlooking.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;One study found that for women in particular, spending time with friends and children helps release oxytocin, a natural stress reliever. This effect is called “tend and befriend,” and is the opposite of the fight-or-flight response.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10941275/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pubmed.gov</a></em></cite></blockquote>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it: life can get stressful. Whether you’re in the workforce or are currently a college student, it’s easy to get overwhelmed with work and deadlines. Coping with stress is never easy, but it&#8217;s especially hard during the pandemic. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 has more of us working from home</a> and doing college classes remotely, which has been a stressful change for everyone &#8211; and had many of us feeling isolated from our family, friends and colleagues. Right now, almost all of us need some tips for anxiety and stress management. Mental health awareness has never been more important than now. </p>



<p>Stress is harmful to both our mental and physical health. It is easy to get caught up with work deadlines and forget to take care of our minds and bodies along the way. But don’t let work and school overwhelm you. Here are 6 tips to help reduce stress and anxiety throughout the week.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Practice deep breathing</h2>



<p>Have you ever tried deep breathing? Breathing is an automatic function, so we often forget to focus on our breath every once in a while. Try deep breathing to help calm your mind and body and reduce anxiety and stress throughout the day. This is one of the oldest methods of coping with stress.</p>



<p>When you’re feeling stressed or anxious, take a moment to sit down in a relaxing spot and focus on your breath. Put your feet flat on the floor with your back against a chair and feel your body being physically supported. Take deep breaths in and out until you feel your mind calm down. Deep breathing is an easy way to help be mindful of our thoughts and feelings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Practice mindfulness</h2>



<p>Mindfulness is an awesome way to help our bodies calm down when we’re anxious or stressed. Mindfulness is the awareness of your thoughts and feelings, and your ability to be in the present moment. Deep breathing is an easy way to practice mindfulness daily. If you want to get creative, try practicing yoga or meditation in order to get more connected with your mind and body! <a href="https://www.mindful.org/free-mindfulness-apps-worthy-of-your-attention/">Here&#8217;s a few apps </a>that help you along on your journey!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Take small breaks during the day</h2>



<p>Give yourself a break &#8211; you deserve it! It’s important to remember to not overwork our minds and bodies. So, take a break a few times during the day if you’re working from home or doing online classes. Walk outside for 10 minutes or play with a pet to de-stress. Your mind will thank you later! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Talk to someone you love</h2>



<p>Coping with stress becomes infinitely easier if you can share your thoughts with someone. So, when was the last time you called a parent or a friend? Working from home during a pandemic can be extremely isolating, and as a result takes a toll on our mental health. It is also especially hard to connect face to face with loved ones during COVID-19. Reach out to a close relative or friend that you haven’t spoken to in a while. They will love hearing from you, and you will feel better afterwards!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Pick up a hobby</h2>



<p>This is one of the best tips for anxiety and stress management out there. Picking up a hobby is an awesome way to de-stress at the end of a long work or school day. Moreover, it&#8217;s important to keep activities and hobbies that we enjoy a part of our lives.</p>



<p>Do you like to read? Are you artistic? Do you like to write? Find a hobby that you enjoy and make sure to set aside some time during the week to practice it. It’s important to find the right balance between work and activities that bring you joy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Make time to chill out</h2>



<p>Let yourself relax! Make sure that you take care of yourself and let yourself unwind after a long day or a long week.</p>



<p>So, cook yourself a home cooked meal, watch your favorite Netflix show, or take a bubble bath. Make an effort to do one activity each day that helps you to chill out. Having downtime will help make you feel less stressed and anxious during the week.</p>
