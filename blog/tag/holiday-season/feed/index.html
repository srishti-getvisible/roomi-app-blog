<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. A themed family games night</h2>



<p>The holiday season is a perfect occasion to cozy up, relax and have fun! If you find yourself searching for something more to do, why not organise a games night? We suggest you stick to holiday-themed games such as Christmas trivia, to keep things appropriately festive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Virtual wine tasting</h2>



<p>A Zoom wine tasting event is a great way to discover new wines with friends while pretending you’re at a gorgeous vineyard in Napa (instead of the same house you’ve been in for eight months!). A little festive escapism is just what we need in 2020, right?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. A holiday playlist</h2>



<p>Nothing gets us into the spirit quite like holiday music. Curate a memorable playlist by asking your family and friends to add their all-time favorite holiday song to the list. Pour yourself a wine and have a singalong!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. <strong>Get crafty with &#8216;Thank You&#8217; cards</strong></h2>



<p>A great Christmas Day activity is to get crafty! Pull out some scrapbooking supplies and sit down for an art project and an opportunity to express gratitude to the ones you love &#8211; and yourself!</p>

<p>The holidays are going to look a bit different this year, but that doesn’t mean we have to miss out on some of the season’s most festive activities. It’s really about spreading cheer, and helping others less fortunate than you are is a great way to demonstrate that. Your efforts may mean more than you know.</p>



<p>In fact, this year is a great opportunity to create new holiday traditions that are fun, safe and memorable.</p>

<p>Giving unique gifts to your loved ones around the holiday season can be quite a daunting task. Especially, if you are operating on a tight budget. While you want to be giving and generous, you also want to buy groceries too! Just in case you didn&#8217;t know, a big price tag doesn&#8217;t always mean better. Affordable but thoughtful gifts really do exist.</p>



<p>So, why not prepare a gift-giving budget? You can create specific budgets for special occasions, such as a holiday gift budget that you can work towards in terms of saving. If money is super-tight, you might not have much to spend&#8230; and that&#8217;s okay!</p>

<p>Sure everyone likes receiving flowers as presents, but give them a week and they&#8217;re gone. Instead, we recommend going for unique gifts like succulents, and miniature indoor plants! They&#8217;re the kind of gifts your loved ones would appreciate a lot more. </p>



<p>Why? because they last longer, and don&#8217;t require any active care like most other plants do!</p>

<p>These make a great gift item for both the beauty-conscious friend and the one that needs some TLC. Sometimes getting them something they might not regularly buy for themselves is a sign of a truly well-thought-out gift! These could also be thought-out products, like curly-hair products if your loved one has curly hair!</p>

<p>This option is fun and creative, and can be pretty cheap if you strategize correctly! It’s totally up to you when it comes to choosing what you stash in your hamper, and just remember &#8211; the more personal the items, the better the gift!</p>

<p>The gift that keeps on giving!</p>



<p>Pop open a bottle (or two!) of wine and have a games night with the people you like best. By gifting a board game, you&#8217;ll make the night even more fun than simply getting the gang together.&nbsp;To top it off, you&#8217;ll be able to play games every time you get together. Now that’s a great gift on a budget!</p>

<p>One great option is to make a small donation in their name to a cause they really care about. Whether it&#8217;s providing cancer treatment to kids, saving endangered wildlife, or finding a home for cats and dogs in need, a small donation can go a long way and be a really lovely gift, especially around the holidays when it&#8217;s all about being grateful and giving back!</p>



<p>When you give a gift, it should be because you want to, not because you feel you have to.</p>



<p>And you definitely shouldn’t let gift-giving derail your budget or throw you off track when it comes to your financial goals.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s the thought that counts!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the holiday season in full swing, many of us are scrambling around trying to figure out what plans to make. COVID-19 is still very much a threat, and numerous people across the country (and the world!) are choosing to stay home or have very small gatherings to celebrate the holiday season. This year&#8217;s festivities feel so gloomy, that many of us are findings ways of surviving the holidays without getting sad about it.</p>



<p>There’s no denying that this Christmas and New Year will look very different&#8230; but don’t let that give you the holiday blues!</p>



<p>Whether you’re staying at home with your roommates or you&#8217;re choosing a select few people to spend Christmas with, here are a few tips to help you survive (and enjoy!) the holiday season during the year of COVID-19!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="9266" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-survive-the-holidays-during-covid-19-roomi/attachment/surviving-the-holidays-1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/surviving-the-holidays-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,683" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="surviving the holidays 1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/surviving-the-holidays-1.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/surviving-the-holidays-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/surviving-the-holidays-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="A family wearing matching PJs on Christmas Day" class="wp-image-9266" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/surviving-the-holidays-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/surviving-the-holidays-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/surviving-the-holidays-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Surviving the holidays is easier if you have a plan!</h2>



<p>Make sure to let your parents know what your COVID-19 holiday plans are! If you normally have a huge family get together over the holidays, you’ll definitely need to discuss safety precautions this year. Every family is different, so if you decide that it’s best for everyone to stay at home for the holidays, be sure that everyone is clear on that decision. Make sure you listen to all of your family members&#8217; thoughts and concerns about holiday gatherings.</p>



<p>Depending on your circumstances, you might have to have some awkward &#8211; but essential &#8211; conversations with your family. If you’re nervous to tell your family that you won’t be home for Christmas, always have a game plan before you speak to them. Write down everything you want to say and make sure you cover all your bases!</p>



<p>Take a deep breath and remember that almost every young person is having the same conversation this holiday season with their family too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Staying home for the holidays? Make it fun!</h2>



<p>If you decide not to see family over Christmas and stay home instead because of COVID-19, be sure to make it fun! Moreover, if you have roomis &#8211; plan special holiday activities for the week leading up to Christmas and on Christmas day. Create new traditions with your roommates to get into the holiday spirit!</p>



<p>Beat the holiday blues by watching your favorite holiday movies, bake cookies, gingerbread house, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/occasions/christmas/nations-top-30-christmas-carols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sing along to the Christmas carols</a> you love. Don’t forget to buy gifts for your roommates and put them under the tree! TBH, surviving the holidays is easier when you have someone by your side.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Have a Zoom call with family on Christmas Day</h2>



<p>If you decide not to be with family this year for safety reasons, be sure to set up a time to call your relatives on Christmas day. Communicate with everyone in your family and set up a time for a group holiday Zoom call.</p>



<p>We know that seeing your parents and loved ones on a screen isn’t the same as seeing them in person. However, it will make your day feel a lot more like Christmas when you do. Try setting up a time for all your family members to open presents together over Zoom. This way, you can enjoy some special moments together.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Lift your spirits by doing activities you enjoy</h2>



<p>This year has been stressful to say the least. Not being able to see loved ones around the Christmas period isn&#8217;t ideal. But don’t let it completely dull your sparkle. Make sure to practice self-care that&#8217;s the best way to surviving the holidays without getting sad or stressed. Get into the holiday spirit by doing little things each day that you enjoy.</p>



<p>Watch a feel-good movie, catch up with an old friend, go on a hike, make your favorite dinner dish. Honestly, the possibilities are endless and the little things really do count!</p>



<p>This year, no matter what you do, do something each day that brings you joy. It really will make the holiday season seem a lot brighter!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alas, the holiday season is upon us! The beautiful Christmas trees, the festive lights and the sparkling decorations&#8230;it’s all so magical! It’s one of few times in a year that you get to spend quality time with your friends and family. And just bask in the spirit of the holiday season while cooking up thoughts of making extra money for the holidays. So in this blog we&#8217;re going to talk about how to make money for Christmas to take your celebration up a notch!</p>



<p>But since the pandemic is here to stay, just like with everything else this year, this one is going to be a <em>little</em> different. There won’t be any big Christmas celebrations or New Year’s Eve parties this time around. However, the one thing that <em>will</em> remain the same is that your expenses will increase. And for once, most of us have the time to pick up a side hustle and make extra money for the holidays. So, in the spirit of this festive season, let’s all gather around (while socially distancing, of course.) And figure out how to make extra money for the holidays, pandemic style.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Make and sell holiday crafts</h2>



<p>How do you make extra money for the holidays during the season? Well, if you are gifted in arts and crafts, you could consider sharing your skills and selling holiday crafts. After all, one of the best parts of this season <em>is</em> the decorations!</p>



<p>Christmas stockings, holiday cards, seasonal candles- the list is endless. And it doesn’t have to be all about Christmas; if you want ideas for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/easy-diy-hanukkah-decor-ideas-for-your-home-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hanukkah decorations</a>, here are some great options! Whether you want to stick to traditional decorations or craft something entirely new, we guarantee there&#8217;s an audience for it.</p>



<p>Sites like <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Etsy</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">eBay</a> and Fiverr are great platforms where you can put up your stuff and get a really good deal. So pick up your supplies and get crafting to make extra money for the holidays.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Become a holiday driver to make extra money for the holidays</h2>



<p>Holiday season invariably means that there will be a hike in package deliveries. Sending out gifts and packages to your loved ones who live across the country has become a pretty standard part of the holidays. And the pandemic has made mailing gifts even more popular. Which is to say that drivers are in pretty high demand during the season.</p>



<p>So if you have a car (enjoy driving), and don’t mind odd hours, this could be the job for you to make extra money for the holidays! Simply do an internet search for delivery jobs in your area. Then find a listing that suits you, and you could become your neighborhood&#8217;s friendly gift bearer! Ahoy Santa!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Become a holiday helper to make money for Christmas</h2>



<p>Holiday helper kinda sounds like a job for Santa’s elves. And as charming as that picture is, you don’t actually need to be an elf to be a holiday helper. This season brings with it a variety of jobs to make extra money for the holidays. And you can choose from being a holiday shopper to wrapping Christmas presents to helping families with putting up their decorations. So keep an eye out on your social media handles for these jobs to come across many such listings.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Retail jobs are a good way to make extra money for the holidays</h2>



<p>Retail jobs, also known as the dream job of any 15-year-old looking to make extra money for the holidays or otherwise, can be tricky. If you’ve worked in the service industry before, the idea of working a retail job during the holiday season might make you want to scream. And that’s before even taking into account the whole pandemic situation. After all, people in general aren&#8217;t known to be at their kindest while holiday shopping. </p>



<p>However, if you can get past this, a retail job can be an excellent way to make extra money for the holidays. Especially because of the increase in demand during the holiday season.</p>



<p>And you don’t even have to necessarily work the cash register. There are many different jobs waiting to be filled! So check out your local retail outlets, social media and job sites for something that&#8217;s right for you to make extra money for the holidays.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Consider house/baby/pet sitting to make money for Christmas</h2>



<p>Ah yes, ‘tis the season where numerous “sitting” jobs are in high demand to help you make money for Christmas. The pandemic may mean that families aren&#8217;t travelling much this year, but that doesn&#8217;t mean house sitters are going out of business. </p>



<p>The holiday season is as stressful as always, so babysitting and petsitting jobs seem to be going nowhere. So, call up your friends, families and neighbors and see if any of them are looking for assistance and get on your way to make extra money for the holidays.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year! Nowhere is better than New York City around Christmastime; from Macy’s window shopping to admiring the tree at Rockefeller Center, there’s no denying that NYC is the most magical place to be during Christmas. Lockdown or not, Christmas still came along. And so did the snow. It was solemn, maybe a little lonely. But we weren&#8217;t all alone. </p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-covid-essentials-to-keep-at-home-in-2020-roomi" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">With the pandemic still weighing heavily on our shoulders,</a> there’s been much speculation as to whether or not NYC Christmas festivities will still be happening this year. The answer is yes, they will be happening! There will be new health and safety precautions at the traditional Christmas exhibits in order to keep visitors safe, and it&#8217;s a bonus that most activities are already held outdoors.</p>



<p>If you’re new to the city or are visiting and are looking for some Christmastime magic, here are <strong>5 festive Christmas activities to do in New York City during December!</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Window Shopping at Herald Square</h2>



<p>Every Christmas, large department stores such as Macy’s put on a spectacular holiday display in their store windows at Herald Square. Despite the pandemic, this holiday tradition is still on for this year.</p>



<p>This year’s windows will be dedicated to first responders and essential workers in order to pay tribute to those who have helped us through 2020. Since 2020 has been a tumultuous year, Macy’s windows at Herald Square will be a special tribute to the individuals who have made this year hopeful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The Winter Village at Bryant Park</h2>



<p>Bryant Park festivities are back this year in full swing! The Winter Village at Bryant Park consists of 60 different food and shopping spots. You’ll be sure to find numerous homemade gifts and trinkets for the perfect Christmas stocking stuffer.</p>



<p>After enjoying a hot chocolate at one of the many food kiosks, head over to the 17,000-foot ice skating rink located at the Park and enjoy a classic winter tradition. There’s something for everyone at the Winter Village!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Exhausted the first set of movies we listed and ready to explore more options? You&#8217;re in luck because here is the second set of our Christmas Movies on Netflix to catch with your pets, kids, roommates, friends, family, and loved ones!</p>



<p>But before we get started, we want to talk about why Christmas movies are such a great source of comfort. Along with bringing some much-needed festive cheer, experts <a href="https://www.thehits.co.nz/the-latest/experts-suggest-people-who-watch-christmas-movies-are-actually-happier/#:~:text=As%20well%20as%20bringing%20us,which%20comes%20with%20the%20films.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest</a> that watching Christmas movies can also help reduce levels of stress and anxiety, and can even strengthen your relationships thanks to the nostalgia that comes with the films.</p>



<p>Which makes a lot of sense, don&#8217;t you think?</p>



<p>Because Christmas movies are riddled with familiarity and nostalgia, they remind you of the good times you spent growing up with friends and family, and they&#8217;re a sure-fire way to achieve that &#8220;warm and fuzzy&#8221; feeling. However, it&#8217;s not just Christmas movies that will get the good times rolling, psychologists <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thehits.co.nz/the-latest/experts-suggest-people-who-watch-christmas-movies-are-actually-happier/#:~:text=As%20well%20as%20bringing%20us,which%20comes%20with%20the%20films.)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest</a>. There&#8217;s a dopamine rush found in decorating too! `</p>



<p>So, to get the ball rolling, here are some more Christmas movies on Netflix that add all the cheer and joy to the holiday season! Experts recommend these are best enjoyed with a cup of hot cocoa. (By experts, this time we mean Roomi).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Merry Happy Whatever</h2>



<p>The holiday season can be nerve-wracking for a number of reasons, but especially if you are introducing someone new to your family for the first time! In <em>Merry Happy Whatever</em>, a holiday season-themed series on Netflix, a father (Dennis Quaid) grapples with his daughter&#8217;s new boyfriend—not always gracefully.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. The Christmas Chronicles</h2>



<p>Two kids try to catch Santa delivering presents, but they end up coming along for the ride as his little helpers. What&#8217;s better? This one&#8217;s for all ages &#8211; suitable for kids but interesting enough to pique all our interests. So, this one&#8217;s a must-watch Christmas movie on Netflix!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The Christmas Project</h2>



<p>In this warm and fuzzy Christmas movie, a 12-year-old boy reflects back on a time from the holiday season of 1986 where he and his three brothers had to give presents to their school bullies. So, it&#8217;s a lesson in kindness wrapped up in a bow of doing the right thing, brought together in a warm and wholesome film &#8211; everything that the holidays are about!</p>

</div><figcaption>Watch This Movie Here!</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. 48 Christmas Wishes</h2>



<p>The 2017 holiday film starts out lighthearted and fun, but things soon get a little emotional. So, after some elves misplace a town&#8217;s Christmas letters sent to Santa, they head away from the North Pole to obtain the wishes. But then we meet Blake (Liam MacDonald), who still hasn&#8217;t recovered from the death of his father. Now, we were expecting two elves&#8217; misadventures, not a flood of tears?. So, don&#8217;t forget to watch one of the most amazing Christmas movies on Netflix with the kids!</p>

</div><figcaption>Watch This Movie Here!</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The Princess Switch (Part One &amp; Two)</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll have to do a double (or triple) take with this one because Vanessa Hudgens plays two characters: Margaret, the beautiful Duchess of Montenaro, and Stacy, a regular girl from Chicago. Margaret ends up falling for Stacy’s attractive coworker, while Stacy falls in love with Margaret&#8217;s fiancé, the handsome Prince Edward, who is played by Sam Palladio. It sounds more complicated than it really is.</p>
