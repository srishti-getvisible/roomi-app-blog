<p>If you’re on the hunt for a new home, you’re likely looking for the most affordable apartments for rent in Washington D.C., right? Rent control is a pretty nice setup in some of America’s major metros. And Washington D.C. renters are among the&nbsp;lucky ones who can benefit from it.</p>



<p>A lot of the usual rent control laws apply in Washington D.C. as they do in cities like San Francisco&nbsp;and New York City. Whether you’re a new or veteran renter, here’s what you should know. Plus, some tips and a free online tool for finding rent-controlled apartments in Washington D.C.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-rent-control">What is Rent Control?</h2>



<p>Rent control is a legal system administered by the government to limit the amount that landlords can charge for in rent and lease. This also limits how much landlords can raise rent for tenants.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-state-rent-in-washington-d-c">The state rent in Washington D.C.</h3>



<p>Finding apartments for rent in Washington D.C. isn’t complicated, as long as budget isn&#8217;t a factor. With a $1,500 budget, one can find an empty rental unit and the price increases the more amenities you need.</p>



<p>And while that might sound frustratingly similar to a lot of major rental markets plagued with high rent prices, the City has been doing its part to make affordable housing more available. Introducing rent control was one of the first steps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rent-control-in-washington-d-c">Rent Control in Washington D.C.</h2>



<p>Rent control is a hot-button issue in cities across the United States, and Washington D.C. is no exception. With skyrocketing housing costs and a dwindling supply of affordable units, many residents are finding it difficult to keep up with the rising rents.</p>

<p>Rent-controlled apartments in Washington D.C. provide a glimmer of hope for those struggling to find affordable housing. But what does it entail?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What buildings qualify for rent control?</h3>



<p>A&nbsp;majority&nbsp;of rental units in D.C. fall under rent control, yet a surprising number of residents aren&#8217;t aware of how pervasive rent control laws are. All rental complexes with four or more units fall under rent control, thanks to this law, with a few notable exceptions. A dwelling is exempt from rent control if:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>It was built after 1975.</li>



<li>The unit has been continuously vacant since January 1, 1985.</li>



<li>The dwelling is owned by a person not owning more than four rentals.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s subsidized by the Government or the District.</li>



<li>The building is under an improvement plan receiving rehabilitation assistance through the Department of Housing and Community Development.</li>
</ol>



<p>Another exemption is if a rental unit isn&#8217;t registered with the Rental Accommocations Division (RAD), it&#8217;s automatically under rent control even if it counts under these exemptions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How much rent in Washington D.C. increases yearly?</h3>



<p>Basically, if you find apartments for rent in Washington D.C. and they’re in buildings with more than four rental units, and they aren’t new, they’re very likely rent-controlled.</p>



<p>All rent increases are based on a yearly adjusted Consumer Price Index (CPI-W), which factors in workers’ wages. This allows the population to keep up with inflation. Meaning, all rent-controlled units increase in rent each year. But by marginally less&nbsp;than newer rentals and other non-rent-controlled units. Landlords can’t increase rent more than 10 percent each year.</p>



<p>But for most tenants, the average yearly increase is the CPI plus another 2 percent. For disabled or elderly tenants, it’s even lower, with a maximum increase of 5 percent per 12 months.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exceptions to the&nbsp;rule</h3>



<p>In the case that a unit becomes vacant, the landlord can raise the rent&nbsp;price more than once in the same year. The “vacancy increase” rule allows the landlord to:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Increase rent by 10 percent more than was charged to the former tenant; Or,</li>



<li>Rent it for the price of a comparable rental unit, but the rent hike can’t be more than 30 percent.</li>
</ol>



<p>There’s also a clause in the Rental Housing Act of 1985 that allows landlords/property owners to claim hardship. Essentially, if they find themselves unable to make a 12 percent rate of return on the property (with 12-15 months of paper proof of the fact), they can raise the rent to make that 12 percent.</p>



<p>Additionally, a property owner can petition to raise the rent to make improvements to the building required by local law. That being said, tenants should stay in the know about whether their landlord is following the legal processes to raise rent. And if you live in a home that falls under rent control&nbsp;but hasn&#8217;t been registered, you should file a complaint.</p>

However, there is a solution that can make living in the nation&#8217;s capital a little more affordable: check out these three ways on finding rent-controlled apartments in Washington D.C..</p>

<p>All you have to do is input the location or area you&#8217;re planning to move in to and Roomi will show you a list of affordable apartments available for rent. You can then filter your search by duration (flexible, fixed, and 12 months), layout, type of property, number of bedrooms, and popular amenities. Aside from these, there are options to show only ID-verified listings and to input an age range, preferred gender, and the amount of monthly rent.</p>



<p>Roomi also protects its users with its background checks, ID verification, and in-app messaging features.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. With the Section 8 voucher program</h3>



<p>When finding rent-controlled apartments in Washington D.C., the issues lie in vacancy rates pricing, and availability in general. If you’re moving to D.C. with little in the bank, you might apply for&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/find-section-eight-housing/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Section 8</a>, a voucher program for low-income, elderly, or disabled renters.</p>



<p>Due to the increase of rents in the city, with the Section 8 voucher, you&#8217;ll most likely have better luck with smaller units. It&#8217;s less common to find more than a three-bedroom section 8 house in Washington, D.C..</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Scoping out the rent-controlled buildings</h3>



<p>If you don’t qualify for Section 8, there are still plenty of techniques to finding affordable apartments in D.C. The first step is to do some research before you hit the streets looking. Use D.C.’s affordable housing locator, and see what comes up. Research the neighborhoods, and use a realtor to help with the legwork.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a tip: Always&nbsp;ask your landlord&nbsp;about the details of the place you want to rent. Because the landlord will have to disclose that information, legally speaking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Washington D.C. and Its Rent-Controlled Apartments: The Verdict</h2>



<p>With low vacancy rates, it may be difficult to secure a rent-controlled apartment from scratch. But you&nbsp;can&nbsp;run into some luck by finding a housemate who already did the dirty work of locking one down and has an open room to fill. Even if it doesn’t have every amenity on your list, locking down an affordable apartment offers you a lot to gain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 was the year we all learned to live with the “new normal”. We weren’t happy about it, but we got on with things to protect each other. It was a year full of surprises and uncertainties, with industries like travel and real estate taking a knock bigger than any other we can remember. Rent reports said that homeowners, landlords, and tenants all over the world were forced into uncomfortable situations. And at multiple points throughout the year, moving house seemed impossible, with rent prices on a predicted increase. This is why Roomi’s 2020 Year in Review is so interesting. </p>



<p>We took a look at some key data collected over the year of unprecedented times, to uncover how COVID-19 impacted the room rental market in the United States.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There was more urgency amongst people moving to a new city</h2>



<p>There was a lot more moving and shifting between cities in 2020, compared to previous years. It seems like the pandemic is the underlying reason for this, with previous research finding that many renters were either forced out of their homes due to job loss, etc. and many chose to leave more expensive cities in search of somewhere more affordable to work remotely from.</p>



<p>Roomi’s users in particular were in a hurry to either find a roommate or a new place to live. Repeat purchases were up 18% compared to 2018, and a much higher percentage of users on the app actually made a purchase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rent prices continued to decrease steadily</h2>



<p>As reported in our<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-december-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> December room rental report</a>, the price to rent a room decreased throughout the year &#8211; which could be as a result of landlords dropping rent in order to keep rooms filled, instead of empty.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tech migration</h2>



<p>In 2020, Roomi also experienced what has been called “The Great Tech Migration”. People were migrating throughout the country. And all patterns were different to pre-pandemic activity. We witnessed a clear desire to move out into the suburbs. This was noted as people moved from major cities and tech hubs. </p>



<p>It seemed that cities that were bustling at just the start of the year 2020 (such as San Francisco and New York City) experienced more out-migration. And places such as Madison and Cleveland gained the most movers. How temporary or permanent these measures are, we don’t know just yet.</p>



<p>For now, it seems that places like NYC lost their appeal in many ways. It went from a bustling tech hub, with fantastic nightlife, culture, opportunities, and prime shopping streets. To a place that felt empty. For that reason, many people moved to the suburbs. To live with their parents or find cheaper rent. Since they could now work remotely and no longer had to worry about being close to their workplace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The big question on everyone’s lips (well, on our lips at least) is how did the rental market change due to coronavirus? At Roomi, we don’t focus on the entire rental market (full apartments, houses, condos, etc.) but on single rooms. We decided that the best way to figure out what the impact of coronavirus has been on real estate in the United States is by studying our own exclusive data.</p>



<p>So, we gathered some key Roomi facts from March 2020, and compared them to September 2020.</p>



<p>And guess what, guys? The outcome wasn’t as grim as so many predicted early on in the year! In fact, people are branching out and finding new roomis now more than ever! So, whether you’re <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-hunting-in-la-part-1-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">renting in Los Angeles</a>, Boston or NYC, you can count on Roomi to have fresh listings from people all across the states who are ready to become your next roommate.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How did the change in rental market impact Roomi? </h2>



<p>Well, for starters, Roomi had 9600 new registered users in March, and 18,900 sign-ups in September. The short-term rental sector first blossomed following the last recession, with more people appreciating the value that a sharing economy could offer &#8211; especially in uncertain times when many are reluctant to take on a long-term lease or unable to buy their own property. So, there has certainly been a change in the rental market in this regard.</p>



<p>Coronavirus doesn’t seem to have negatively impacted the short-term market; in fact, it’s only spurred it on. When the pandemic first began taking over our lives, 9600 individuals signed up for a Roomi account. In fact, 18,900 people signed up to our platform in September when COVID-19 was in full swing. </p>



<p>Becoming more mainstream by the likes of Airbnb and Roomi, it seems that short-term rentals are here to stay. As more young people are changing the way they travel, work and live, they’re signing up to platforms such as ours to enjoy that flexibility they want &#8211; and need, especially in times like these. The long-term impact of coronavirus on real estate is still revealing itself.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There were 28,300 active listings on Roomi in March, compared to 88,900 in September.</h2>



<p>Fewer people were travelling at the start of the pandemic because of the obvious risk factor. People were reluctant to move &#8211; and who could blame them? </p>



<p>However, it seems that as time has gone on, many of us have learned to live with the pandemic. Aside from those in high-risk groups, we’re noticing many people trying to live their lives as normally as possible. For many, that means having to share their homes with strangers, as living alone is unaffordable. So while there has been a noticeable change in the rental market, people have learnt to cope with it.</p>



<p>We saw a surge of new Roomi listings in September, compared to earlier on in the year. It’s likely that as many people move back in with their family, or partners, lots of rooms are opening up around the states, and landlords and leaseholders just can’t afford to keep them open while we wait for the end of COVID.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There were a total of 550,000 profile views in March, with 1,500,000 in September, and 17,400 unique users submitted a rental request in March, compared to 29,000 in September.</h2>



<p>The good news is Americans are taking action to find their perfect room or roommate match. In February, before coronavirus hit, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/coronavirus-pandemic-cuts-rent-growth-to-a-decade-low.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rent growth for single-family homes</a> had hit its highest pace in four years. Just three months later, it was at its lowest growth rate in a decade. So, the impact of coronavirus on real estate has been massive. This slowdown in rent growth was most dramatic for higher-end rentals. As you can see, the demand for more expensive properties has clearly dropped. So, there has clearly been quite a bit of change in the rental market.</p>



<p>The demand for single room rentals, on the other hand, hasn’t been impacted in the same way. One million extra profile views were made in September compared to March, with rental requests jumping from 17,400 to 29,000 in that period. </p>

<p>COVID-19 has undoubtedly brought strange changes to just about every aspect of our lives. And it’s safe to say that none of us expected it to last as long as it has. Never before has our generation had so much uncertainty around our finances, jobs, and living situations as right now. Besides, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-coronavirus-affected-rental-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronavirus affected the rental market</a> in both expected and unexpected ways.</p>



<p>Because keeping a handle on the rental market is pretty much what we do, Roomi wanted to take a look into our own data to get a better understanding of the impact coronavirus has had on the price of rooms around the U.S.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Median rent for a room in the 10 most popular cities in the U.S.</h2>

<p>Of course, these tangled colored lines don’t give a very clear trend at first glance; most cities appear to follow a trend of their own. So let’s compare the graph to the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102816/coronavirus-covid19-cases-number-us-americans-by-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number of new cases of COVID-19 in the states by day</a>.</p>



<p>To help, we’ve turned the rental market graph into a numbered table showing the median rent price of all 10 combined cities</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>Median cost</strong></td></tr><tr><td>January 1st 2020</td><td>$1200</td></tr><tr><td>February 1st 2020&nbsp;</td><td>$1200</td></tr><tr><td>March 1st 2020</td><td>$1176</td></tr><tr><td>April 1st 2020</td><td>$1150</td></tr><tr><td>May 1st 2020</td><td>$1200</td></tr><tr><td>June 1st 2020</td><td>$1200</td></tr><tr><td>July 1st 2020</td><td>$1150</td></tr><tr><td>August 1st 2020</td><td>$1176</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The median cost of a room took a slight dip in April and July this year; both months saw a spike in new coronavirus cases in the U.S. Still, the drops in rent prices were not dramatic enough for us to make any conclusive statements about how coronavirus has impacted the rental market across the states.</p>



<p>Instead, it makes sense to view a breakdown of cities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does it mean for the rental market in big cities?</h2>



<p>Let’s take a look at how Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco rent prices changed this year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="617" height="351" data-attachment-id="1686" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-coronavirus-has-impacted-rent-prices-in-u-s-cities/attachment/la-ny-sf-median/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LA-NY-SF-median.png?fit=617%2C351&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="617,351" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="LA-NY-SF-median" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LA-NY-SF-median.png?fit=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LA-NY-SF-median.png?fit=617%2C351&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LA-NY-SF-median.png?resize=617%2C351&#038;ssl=1" alt="Graph showing the median rent and rental market trends for LA, NYC, and SF." class="wp-image-1686" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LA-NY-SF-median.png?w=617&amp;ssl=1 617w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/LA-NY-SF-median.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">San Francisco</h2>



<p>San Francisco took the most dramatic drop in the second quarter of 2020. But this isn’t really surprising, as it’s often reported as the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sf.curbed.com/2019/3/15/18267525/san-francisco-zumper-most-expensive-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most expensive city in the U.S.</a> COVID-19&#8217;s impact on the rental market forced renters to rethink their living situation. As more people work from home, they’re prioritizing size and comfort over big-city amenities. Consequently, this demand led to a shift away from costly cities, with people moving to more affordable locations or with family.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Los Angeles</h2>



<p>While SF had a noticeable price uplift in July, Los Angeles remained more steady; and looks to continue on a downhill slope. In fact, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-05-22/california-april-jobless-rate-jobs-disappear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the unemployment rate in California</a> almost tripled from mid-March to mid-April. This stark figure could reflect the state’s reliance on the tourism, hospitality, and entertainment industries. The high unemployment rate has undoubtedly caused a shift in the rental market, with many landlords offering reduced rent or tenants being forced to leave their neighborhood.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New York City</h2>



<p>According to Roomi’s data of median room prices, those in New York City took a very steady decline. Research states that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/realestate/new-york-rents-fall-as-vacancies-rise.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">vacancy rates in NYC</a> in July 2020 were at 3.67%, compared to 1.61% in June 2019. With so much spare space, it’s no wonder New Yorkers have been able to negotiate lower rates with their landlords, even if it’s just on a temporary basis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The novel coronavirus has triggered questions for renters and landlords around the world. It has undoubtedly caused nothing short of a panic. This has resulted in people taking fast financial measures to protect themselves against any unexpected surprises. Coronavirus has led to many people fleeing major cities to escape high rent, moving in with their parents or partners, and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/is-it-legal-sublet-room-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">subletting their room in NYC</a>. The impact of coronavirus on the rental market in New York has also been a difficult topic to address. </p>



<p>We were interested in how coronavirus has affected the rental market in New York and across the states. As a roommate-finding app, we’re lucky enough to have access to unique data at our fingertips, and we were able to paint a picture of what’s changed &#8211; and where the rental market could be headed.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into the numbers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The number of short-term Roomi listings has increased by 40% from April to May.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" data-attachment-id="1237" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-coronavirus-affected-rental-market/attachment/roomi-min-duration-listing/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/roomi-min-duration-listing.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,768" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Roomi minimum duration listings" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/roomi-min-duration-listing.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/roomi-min-duration-listing.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/roomi-min-duration-listing.png?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-1237" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/roomi-min-duration-listing.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/roomi-min-duration-listing.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/roomi-min-duration-listing.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The coronavirus period has seen many renters scrambling to get out of rigid leases, and Roomi’s statistics show that in May 2020, more users were recognizing the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/7-reasons-try-short-term-rental-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">value of short-term options</a>. And the rental market in New York saw this in drastic numbers. The number of listings for places with a duration of just 1-3 months jumped up 40% between April and May.</p>



<p>This could largely be due to leaseholders trying to temporarily cover rooms that were quickly vacated by housemates who had to relocate due to the virus. With landlords and leaseholders understanding that many people can’t commit to a long-term lease right now, it seems many are happy to fill rooms on a short-term basis instead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The average rent in the US&#8217; rental market decreased by 22% between March and April.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" data-attachment-id="1238" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-coronavirus-affected-rental-market/attachment/ave-rent-graph/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ave-rent-graph.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,768" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Average rent graph" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ave-rent-graph.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ave-rent-graph.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ave-rent-graph.png?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="A creative graphic depicting the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the rental market in the US.

<p>Tenants are paying less rent country-wide, with the average US rent decreasing as much as 22% between March and April. The most drastic drop of all here was in San Francisco, which saw a 33% decrease in average rent prices.</p>



<p>But rents are already bouncing back. The graph shows an upward trend beyond June 2020, so <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-personal-finance-mistakes-to-avoid-at-all-costs-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">we don’t expect these low prices to be a permanent change</a>. Anyone closely observing the rental market in New York can easily attest to this.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roomi’s shared room listings increased by 124% from March to May.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" data-attachment-id="1239" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-coronavirus-affected-rental-market/attachment/shared-room-graph/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shared-room-graph.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,768" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="shared room graph" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shared-room-graph.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shared-room-graph.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shared-room-graph.png?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1" alt="A creative graphic depicting the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the rental market in the US.

<p>Roomi listings can fall into one of three categories: private room, shared room, or the entire place. While private room listings are consistently our most popular, we did see the proportion of listings for shared rooms <strong>increase by 124%</strong> from March to May!</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that in the months leading up to May, people were reluctant to share a room with strangers. And this became very clear through the rental market in New York.</p>



<p>During the Coronavirus pandemic, and amid the government’s social distancing measures and general fear of the unknown amongst us, most people chose to quarantine with friends, partners, and family members. Could the rise in shared room listings in May suggest we’re feeling ready to integrate with people again?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roomi’s new users increased by 40% from April to May amid Coronavirus.</h2>

<p>With a worldwide boost of 40% in new sign-ups to the Roomi app from April to May, this suggests that people are back in the market for a home. As shops, schools, hospitality venues and workplaces reopen, it seems that renters around the world are ready to settle back into a new apartment.</p>



<p>More specifically, new users in New York City increased by 27%. The past few months saw New Yorkers heading out to suburbs and leaving many rooms unlived in. Now, however, it seems that people are coming back to the big apple and the city could be coming back to life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New York&#8217;s rental market took a <em>very</em> slight hit.</h2>

<p>Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the rental market in <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/nyc-landlords-never-empty-apartment/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYC is still demanding high prices</a> &#8211; sorry renters! As you can see by the graph, there was a small dip in New York around March, but the contrast was much more subtle than the rest of the world.</p>



<p>Third-party research carried out by <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/q1-2020-market-reports/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">StreetEasy</a> found that there were 52% fewer rentals up for grabs in New York in the second half of March, compared with the first half. </p>



<p>Despite the drop in rental inventory, there was little reduction in rent costs, with only minimal changes in Q1. They also found that a large proportion of landlords were choosing to keep units off the rental market, as opposed to offering reduced rent or breaks in rent. This could be for a variety of reasons; our guess is that they were protecting their finances with the long-term in mind, or that they wanted to avoid contact with other people through viewings.</p>



<p>StreetEasy reports that the median rent in Manhattan in Q1 still stood at $3324 &#8211; a record high in StreetEasy’s Price Index.</p>
