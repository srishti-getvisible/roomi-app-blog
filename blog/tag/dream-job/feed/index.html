										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The modern world has intertwined work and life to an extent that it&#8217;s difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance, love your work, and keep your sanity, all at the same time. Instead, we find ourselves frequently spiraling down and repeatedly thinking, &#8216;<em>I hate my job</em>.&#8217; And then we continue to be tortured by our daydreams of long vacations, sipping on margaritas in the bright sun. And a dream job that doesn&#8217;t require staring into a computer screen at work that doesn&#8217;t feed our passions.</p>



<p>Another significant disadvantage that we now face is the envy we have to deal with when we scroll through social media and see travelers, influencers and our friends seemingly living their best lives! And all of these factors result in making us feel miserable when it comes to the idea of a dream job and &#8216;loving what you do.&#8217;</p>



<p>But the good news is, there are ways to fix that and love your job, even if it&#8217;s not exactly your dream job!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Comparison is a prison that will never help you find your dream job!</h2>



<p>As Theodore Roosevelt said, &#8220;Comparison is the thief of joy.&#8221; Although it can be tempting to compare your lives with friends, strangers, and acquaintances on the internet, you should try to avoid it at all costs. Accept that everyone is at a different point of time in life, and the very idea of happiness in a job differs from person to person. Once you do accept that, you will also start to discover what truly makes YOU happy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. There&#8217;s a time for work and a time for living!</h2>



<p>One of the most dreadful things we do to ourselves is work 24/7. Most of us check our emails the moment we wake up without even giving ourselves the chance to enjoy a morning meal without having to think about work. Love your job or not this habit is stealing the very joy from your lives.</p>



<p>Are you also finding it tough to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separate work from home</a> because of the pandemic? Well, this behavior might leave you feeling exhausted, frustrated, and even reduce your productivity, whether or not you have a dream job.</p>



<p>So fight this by creating and religiously following a &#8216;me time&#8217; in your schedule. It could be as simple as exercise and a peaceful breakfast in the morning before you start work, or an hour of practicing your hobby after work. Whatever it may be, do it every day no matter how much pending work you might have, and you&#8217;ll start to look forward to those little moments of peace every day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Be grateful for having a job right now!</h2>



<p>Even if what you&#8217;re doing to survive right now is not on the path of your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/how-to-choose-your-dream-career-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">dream career,</a> you can start loving what you do by being grateful for having a job in these trying times. Think about what luxuries having a job offers you right now, in the middle of a pandemic. Once you do that, you will realize that even saying &#8216;I hate my job&#8217; right now is a luxury many people might not have.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Accept that loving your job all the time is not possible!</h2>



<p>If you think someone can love every aspect of their job, think again. There&#8217;s bound to be parts of your job that you dread, even if you have your dream job. So accepting the &#8216;I hate my job&#8217; moments can help you appreciate the parts you do like even more. Getting into this mind frame can also help you through a bad day where you&#8217;re feeling especially demotivated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Work towards your goals even if it isn&#8217;t your dream job!</h2>



<p>Always appreciate what you&#8217;re achieving through the job that you have. Even if it isn&#8217;t your dream job, understand that it is a key part of the process to make your dreams come true. If you don&#8217;t have a goal in mind and are just working to survive, make some goals. Maybe your goal is a better job in an industry you find exciting, or perhaps your goal is to become debt-free or maintain a particular lifestyle. If you still think your present isn&#8217;t as bright as you imagined, you should make goals for<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-ways-to-think-about-your-future-career-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a better future</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Accept that your work might not be working out for you!</h2>



<p>If all the above points don&#8217;t make sense to you, and your work conditions feel toxic and harmful to your health, you need to think about a job switch. If it&#8217;s the industry or the kind of work you loathe, research and put in the effort to sharpen your skills and opt for a career switch. Working towards the change alone will give you more purpose when you seem to have none.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many people look at failing in a negative light. But it&#8217;s important to remember that failure means that you&#8217;re trying. To err is human; no matter how successful you get, be assured that you&#8217;re still going to make mistakes. So it&#8217;s okay to make career mistakes too &#8211; we all do it!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I&#8217;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I&#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.&#8221;</p><cite><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Being mindful about career mistakes and learning from them will bring you a step closer to personal growth and success. Many people with high-pressure jobs spend their entire careers geared towards reaching their desired position but end up dreading their career journey. If you&#8217;re struggling at work, have just began your career or know someone who&#8217;s feeling stuck at work, continue reading. Here are some of the biggest career mistakes you can avoid (or make them and lean from them!)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Letting another person make your career decisions = biggest career mistake!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/HozfRdy8Qe4hVsbkk2" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/HozfRdy8Qe4hVsbkk2/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Each person is unique with their own set of experiences, thought patterns and preferences. You might turn to your best buddies for an outfit approval while shopping or you might seek approval from your parents when you&#8217;re making a big life decision but remember that it&#8217;s YOU in the end who has to deal with all consequences- good or bad. When it comes to your career, it&#8217;s natural to consult your core group, but don&#8217;t let your inner voice drown out. Trust your gut and find your inner voice of reason and make that voice your priority.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Not being able to balance your personal &amp; professional life</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/111LSMM1ICPqBq" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/111LSMM1ICPqBq/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>We usually spend eight to ten hours of our day at work &#8211; maybe more &#8211; so it&#8217;s understandable that some of us might make work our identity. Before your career takes an all assuming role, remember that finding balance in life is like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. A healthy life comprises of a good balance of work, family, friends, and mental health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. A perception that once you choose a field, you are stuck with it forever is one of the most common career mistakes</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:42%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l4FGquSwfx52EPXzO" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FGquSwfx52EPXzO/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Many of us think it is impossible to switch career paths after training and gaining experience in a particular domain. If you want, you can gradually transition to other fields. In today&#8217;s digital world, you&#8217;re subconsciously learning new things through social media, so focus on marketable skills and keep your eyes open for opportunities of your interest. You never know what you can achieve.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Burning all bridges</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6v4VaKAwgmLoA" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/6v4VaKAwgmLoA/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>It might seem right to sever all contacts and say good riddance when switching to your new career. Whatever be your reason for moving on, and whether you had a good experience or a bad one, keep networking with your old employer, you never know when you will require their help or reference.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Assuming you&#8217;re indispensable</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:53%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/HFHovXXltzS7u" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/HFHovXXltzS7u/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Never think of yourself as indispensable &#8211; feel grateful that you have the opportunity to contribute at work. Nobody is bigger than the organization and its goals. If you are not contributing, you might be a burden to the company. One example is Uber, where the founder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/technology/uber-travis-kalanick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Travis Kalanick was forced to resign</a> in 2017. Don&#8217;t know about you but it can be difficult for some folks to avoid career mistakes such as this one! Esp. if you&#8217;re a workaholic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Talking bad and gossiping is the worst career mistake out there!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT9KVuimKtly3zoJ0Y" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9KVuimKtly3zoJ0Y/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>The &#8216;mean girls&#8217; approach just doesn&#8217;t cut it at work. Avoid negativity at the workplace, and at all costs, avoid gossiping &#8211; negative things bubble up very quickly, noise gets created, and you will be found out sooner rather than later. Never ever jeopardize your relationship with anyone in your current organization. The industry is such a funny place, you&#8217;ll not even know when your current manager will be your lead in your forthcoming career path, OR your future plans might not fall in place, and you might have to take help from your current employer.</p>

<p>Applying for jobs and doing your best in an interview, and then <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/do-this-while-you-wait-to-hear-from-a-job-interview-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waiting to hear back</a> is taxing as it is. On top of that, if you have to face rejection, it can be disheartening and demotivating. The good news is, it doesn&#8217;t have to feel this way. You can work through the demotivation by rejecting to view job interview rejection as a failure. <strong>Or, as John C. Maxwell has quoted, “Successful people reject rejection.”</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/cbc-schittscreek-schitts-creek-2Uy1J40PlLn3XFFAnz"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/2Uy1J40PlLn3XFFAnz/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dont Give Up Schitts Creek GIF by CBC - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="480" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>You might be tempted to think you don&#8217;t have what it takes if your job interview doesn&#8217;t materialize as you were hoping it would. Like your roomis and your friends, we want you to remember that if something doesn&#8217;t work out, you might soon realize that it worked in your favor.</p>



<p>So instead of letting a job interview rejection take a toll on your self-esteem, make rejection your friend and turn it into an opportunity instead.</p>



<p><strong>Here are some things to do when you&#8217;re facing job interview rejection</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Job interview rejection and confused why? Ask for feedback!</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s no point in overthinking and self-analyzing why you were rejected. Because chances are, you will not get the right answer. Instead, you could ask your recruiter or interviewer to tell you what went wrong to be better prepared for your next interview.</p>



<p>If you do receive a bland answer in return, you should push them to give you more details. If another candidate was favored over you, ask them to tell you what you lacked as a candidate. Additionally, explain why you need an answer and how it will help you in your job search.</p>

<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/DUrdT2xEmJWbS"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/DUrdT2xEmJWbS/giphy.gif?resize=245%2C180&#038;ssl=1" alt="The Office Questions GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="245" height="180" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xpYSZfe2uz"><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs/">6 Must-Have Skills For Individuals Seeking Remote Jobs In 2021</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;6 Must-Have Skills For Individuals Seeking Remote Jobs In 2021&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog" src="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs/embed/#?secret=xpYSZfe2uz" data-secret="xpYSZfe2uz" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Job interview rejection 101: It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s probably them</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s clichéd because it is true. If you&#8217;ve performed your best and did all you could to nail that last job interview and still faced rejection, then the company or position was simply not meant for you. That doesn&#8217;t mean you sit and blame the company for not understanding your true potential. Sometimes things don&#8217;t work out &#8211; and it&#8217;s for the best.</p>



<p>Maybe they didn&#8217;t see you as a fit for the environment, or the employer simply didn&#8217;t feel it in their gut to hire you. They&#8217;re human too, after all. And a lot of our decisions &#8211; personal and professional &#8211; largely depend on the way we feel about what our stomachs tell us. So don&#8217;t sweat over it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/WatchUMC-umc-know-your-worth-ahd-2jEJgBs4KJPzehLEvY"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/2jEJgBs4KJPzehLEvY/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Self Love Know Yourself GIF by UMC - Stream Black Better - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Work on your skillset</h2>



<p>Review your CV and try to spot any outdated skills that might not have made you the perfect fit. If you realize something lacks in your professional skillset, make this an opportunity to learn something new.</p>



<p>New jobs are being added to the job market rapidly because of technological developments and the pandemic. So you could make use of this interview rejection and sharpen your professional skills instead of feeling bad for yourself.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/kimsconvenience-KyB0hdI0ssTIbDU5lM"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/KyB0hdI0ssTIbDU5lM/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lying Andrea Bang GIF by Kim&#039;s Convenience - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Apply to places you&#8217;re confident about</h2>



<p>If a headhunter or recruiter has scouted you, you need to put in the research to see if you can adjust to the position they think you fit well. You need to realize that recruiters are just doing their job, and we all know, sometimes we value finishing our work over giving our 100%.</p>



<p>Give them the benefit of the doubt. Thoroughly research the position and the company before spending too much energy on the job interview and the subsequent rejection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don&#8217;t stop looking!</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t give up on looking for a good opportunity based on your previous job interview rejection. Look at the larger picture and find something you love and pursue that. Maybe it didn&#8217;t work out because better opportunities are on your way.</p>



<p>That said, don&#8217;t just think about it while moping in front of the TV or with your roomi. Instead, start reviewing and planning for a possible career switch (if you often find yourself thinking you need it) or find the organizations that you want to work for and then put in the effort to pursue that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. What are your best strengths?</h2>



<p>Play the interviewer and ask yourself this question when negativity from a job interview rejection looms. When you feel demotivated, and your self-esteem feels attacked, the best thing to do to recover and push harder is to focus on your strengths. Define your professional as well as personal strengths and note them down. Take help from your roomis, friends, and family. Slowly but surely, you WILL get through this!</p>

<p>Choosing a dream career can be tough. After all, there are so many options out there! With social media and the internet influencing us daily, It can be challenging to find the perfect <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/5-books-to-boost-your-career-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">career</a> path for yourself amidst the chaos in your mind. So, in this blog we&#8217;re going to learn which important questions we need to ask, to really understand where our strengths lie. But remember, finding the right career isn&#8217;t simple and comparing yourself with others will only slow you down.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. To choose your dream career, look into your hobbies</h2>



<p>Want to know how to find the perfect career path for yourself? Firstly, you&#8217;ll need to ask yourself a few questions. For example, how do you like to spend you free time? What are you good at? Do you prefer working with your hands or your mind? Do you like being around people? Love to coach kids/people? Like to interact with nature? Love numbers and puzzles? Or maybe you like to write? Perhaps you like playing  a certain kind of video game? Love to talk to an audience?</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:38%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/YhK2luXg423VS" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/YhK2luXg423VS/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Your skills and interests point to your career, although they may be a few steps away and not visible right now. You may love to coach a young team of kids, but it does not necessarily mean that you should become a professional coach. However it indicates that you have excellent leadership skills and that which can be applied in a variety of job roles. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Does your idea of success and your dream career match?</h2>



<p> What do you value in life? For example, do you want a lot of money or own fancy cars and houses or do you want free time? Do you value fun at work or having a large family or following a dream? Do you love to be in the city or the country? Love to live overseas or in the suburbs? we&#8217;re asking because answers to these crucial questions will help you zone in what your dream career looks like. If you love fast cars and are living in the hills, then you probably have to choose a job among them. Your inner passion will bring out the value of the work you will do and will help in finding the right career path for you. So, if you&#8217;re struggling with how to find the perfect career, this can be very helpful in figuring out what you want.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. What kind of life do you want?</h2>



<p>So, when you think about your future, how do you picture yourself? Do you see yourself living an ordinary life where perhaps you settle down young and start a family in the suburbs? Or do you see yourself living an adventurous life where your career takes you just about anywhere in the world, and you keep your bags permanently ready and packed? As an adventurous person, you might want to be a wildlife photographer, traveling to dangerous places with your camera. In order for you to narrow down to your dream career, it&#8217;s important to visualize yourself in the future living the life you want.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Are you willing to compromise?</h2>



<p>You will not have much free time if you are young, an investment banker or a corporate lawyer, getting paid big bucks. But as an airline pilot or truck driver, you will be spending lots of time outside the home. On the other hand, you will have to study for a long time and get your Ph.D. if you want to become a college professor. As a famous actor/actress, you have to slog it out in front of others who may judge you according to your talent and looks. Does that sound like the perfect career path for you?</p>

				</div>

	</div>
	


<p>What is it that you are willing to sacrifice? A music band breaks up because some members realize that they are are not willing to sacrifice their time for those endless on-the-road gigs to get famous. Some realize late in life that they are not willing to sacrifice their time even in exchange for fat salaries. These are painful discoveries once you have settled and trodden down your dream career path. If you want to know how to find the perfect career, you&#8217;ll have to have these tough conversations first. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Which subjects were your favorite at school?</h2>



<p>Which subjects in school are the most fun to you? Do you hate science and math and love English? If yes, then your perfect career path probably won&#8217;t be a doctor, scientist, engineer or economist. You might end up with a communication-based career such as a writer, lawyer, teacher or the like. Analyzing what fits you is a first step to determining your dream career. Finding the right career isn&#8217;t so hard after all!</p>

								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Proactive attitude</h2>



<p>If you want to know your dream career choice intimately, you need to to be self aware and start by understanding yourself. If you&#8217;re just starting finding the right career path for you, try the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Informational interviewing – talk to somebody who&#8217;s doing your dream job. So, pick up the phone and find out what&#8217;s right for you!</li><li>Summer jobs – a great way to get to know what your job will be like because they provide you with hands-on experience that lets you see what type of environment you do or don’t want to be working in.</li><li>Internships – the best way to test out a career is by getting to work for a company for some time. You get to check the ‘real world’ to see the environment, culture, and politics of your chosen career. So, check <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.internqueen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Intern Queen</a> for a variety of internships.</li><li>Career tests – discover your strengths and interests. Some of the best career tests are <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://careersoutthere.com/career-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Myers-Briggs<strong>®</strong> MBTI® personality type assessment</a>, StrengthsFinder 2.0, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://careersoutthere.com/career-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iStartStrongTM inventory</a>.</li><li>Volunteer work – This allows you to do a good deed while getting work experience that you might not otherwise get. The experience can uncover skills and interests that you might be unaware you had. Moreover, it helps you expose yourself to a wider variety of people and broadens your network.</li></ul>

<p>So you just had a job interview and you did everything you could. From <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/five-tips-to-spruce-up-your-resume/1516/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sprucing up your resume</a> to making sure you looked your best- you did everything to the best of your abilities. You took the time out to sharpen your professional skills before you even applied for the job. You were prepared for all the interview questions and came across as confident and trustworthy. It ended with &#8216;Thank you, we&#8217;ll get back to you&#8217;. But it&#8217;s been an hour since you left the interview room and patience is running out by the minute. Come night time, and you can&#8217;t sleep thinking about what you should and shouldn&#8217;t have said. </p>



<p>You might feel tempted to get up in the morning and call or email your interviewer asking if you got the job. But you worry if they don&#8217;t reply, you might end up being even more stressed out.</p>

<p>What you need to do, first of all &#8211; is calm down! The truth is, you gave it your all, and your interviewers might be busy. You&#8217;ll probably get that job; remember that it could all take longer than you expected. And of course, we all know &#8216;good things come to those who wait.&#8217;</p>



<p>But if you&#8217;re thinking what the heck you&#8217;re supposed to do while you wait, we&#8217;ve got your worried back.</p>



<p>Read up on our top tips to handle the anxiety and do something productive with your time while you wait to hear back from your job interview.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Don&#8217;t stop looking for the next job interview</h2>



<p>The not-so-easy to accept truth of the matter is, your interviewer might be doing the same thing. They might have a couple of interviews lined up (yes, even after YOU showed up).  And they will come to a decision only when they&#8217;ve gone through all the job interviews with the shortlisted candidates.</p>



<p>Instead of constantly worrying about and praying to hear back, you should keep applying to and exploring other <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job opportunities</a>. If finances are the main worry, you should also look for side hustles to stay safe and get another source of income as soon as you can. This might even distract you from the previous interview since you&#8217;ll be busy looking at other company profiles and preparing for interviews with them. Plus, the more interview questions you answer, the better you get at it!</p>

<p>If you fear your skills might soon be outdated, take this time to<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/sharpen-your-professional-skills-in-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> improve your skills</a>. It&#8217;s never too late to sharpen your professional skills! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. What job interview? Read that fat book. </h2>



<p>While a job is essential to survival, it&#8217;s not the end-all and the only purpose of life. There&#8217;s a vast world out there waiting for you to engage your curiosity. If you&#8217;ve been putting off a great book that you always wanted to read but had no time for when you were working &#8211; NOW is the time!</p>



<p>If you come to like the book, you&#8217;ll easily be distracted from the anxiety of waiting to hear back from the job interview. Apart from killing time, reading a good book will help you transcend into another reality that might have vast knowledge to offer on the way. And maybe, it&#8217;ll help you prepare for interview questions the next time around. </p>



<p>If you need some help, <a href="https://www.hannahbrenchercreative.com/blog/quarantinereadinglist" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here&#8217;s a great list of books</a> you can check out!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Play hard to get</h2>



<p>Okay you&#8217;re done with the job interview and the million different interview questions. Now, it&#8217;s a good idea to send your interviewer an appreciation email for taking out the time to meet you. Just resist the urge to send multiple follow-ups, which can end up annoying your prospective employer.</p>



<p>So it would work best for you if you don&#8217;t email or call them repeatedly or check-in immediately. Play it cool. (even if you aren&#8217;t)</p>

								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Commence online detective work</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re eagerly waiting to hear back from a job interview, and there&#8217;s nothing else you can focus on, put your time and energy into researching the company. After all, if you are daydreaming about getting a positive reply, you should know how to respond when that call finally comes in.</p>



<p>So after you sigh at your daydreams, be the digital Sherlock Holmes you are and uncover whatever you can about the company: its employees, its products and services, and whatever else you stumble upon. Plus this is a great way to sharpen your professional skills. If your profession is being a world class spy. </p>



<p>This research will help you determine where and how you fit into the company and whether you would indeed be happy if you were to join. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Meditate</h2>



<p>Calm down your anxious mind with meditation. Whenever you feel tempted to refresh your email app a zillion times or check your phone every minute to see if they&#8217;ve responded, deny yourself the panic-stricken joy. Lie down in a dimly lit area in your house and focus on your breath. Let the thoughts come in and go as they please. Choose not to interact with them. You&#8217;ll find a much-needed sense of calm and sail through with lesser effort that panic requires you to put in. You&#8217;ll also find that meditating helps sharpen your professional skills. It&#8217;s magical!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had to sit through a job interview, then you know how important your resume is! It&#8217;s a way for you to market yourself and promote your career experience. It has your qualifications for a recruiter or hiring manager to clearly see. Your resume is one of the primary documents they use to decide whether or not you might be a fit for your dream job. But don&#8217;t worry, because Roomi has got some of the best career advice for you! </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s be real —crafting an effective and impactful resume so that you can secure a job interview requires much thought and hard work. A short paragraph of all your skills, experience, and professional history into a crisp document that grabs the hiring manager&#8217;s eyes within just a few seconds is a challenge.</p>

<p>So how can you make sure that your brilliance is captured in a one-page resume? A 2018 study by Ladders (online job-matching service) found that recruiters typically only <a href="https://www.theladders.com/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">spend about six seconds</a> reviewing an individual&#8217;s resume.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a tiny window of time to convince a stranger that you&#8217;re the right person for your dream job. The thought is daunting, but that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here- to give you impeccable career advice!</p>



<p> By including specific information on your CV, you significantly increase your chances of landing an interview, no matter what field you&#8217;re applying for!</p>

<p>So, to make the most of your six seconds, here are the five things you should always put on your resume:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-job-interview-basics-focus-on-your-accomplishments">1. Job interview basics: focus on your accomplishments</h2>



<p>This may be an obvious career advice, but it&#8217;s important to say anyway. Having an accomplishment highlighted on your resume looks impressive. Not to mention, it shows you off well. But remember, recruiters care more about the impact of your achievements. For example, how did you help your previous employers and customers? Has your work effort resulted in a sales boost? Can you confidently tell them that an initiative you led increased client acquisition? Or that you were responsible for their boosted revenue? Having the specifics down on paper will also help you during your job interview.  But remember to back your achievements with credible statements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-data-and-examples-will-help-with-the-job-interview">2. Data and examples will help with the job interview! </h2>



<p>It&#8217;s essential to provide data that validate your accomplishment and its impact. The more you highlight your achievements and their impact, the better it is. But the info you provide needs to be specific and linked to your achievement. For example, you can use numbers (everyone loves a good graph!) to elaborate quantifiable examples of success. This will let the hiring managers know that you&#8217;re the one for your dream job.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-a-clean-and-consistent-format">3. A clean and consistent format</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Once you&#8217;re in the room, the resume doesn&#8217;t matter much,&#8221; </p>
<cite>Laszlo Bock, former senior VP of people operations at Google.</cite></blockquote>



<p>But, to ensure yourself a job interview, your resume should be near perfect. But don&#8217;t worry, we have some great resume, or rather, career tips- </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use only black ink on white paper with half-inch margins.</li>



<li>Make sure all columns are aligned. </li>



<li>Keep <a href="https://picsart.com/fonts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fonts</a>, sizes, and spacing consistent. </li>



<li>Keep your resume tight. </li>



<li>Craft a concise and focused bio.  </li>



<li>Prioritizes the most critical information. </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-personal-touch">4. Personal touch</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re desperate to get a job interview, you may want to send the same resume to 50 different employers. But that&#8217;s not such a great idea. Your goal is to advance to the next round of the process. So, it is better to tailor your resume to match the job description. There is no better career advice than this. </p>



<p>While you&#8217;re at it, don&#8217;t just rely on your resume to get a job. Look for other ways to make your personality shine. Sending a cover letter could help you communicate more about who you are and what you can contribute to the company.&nbsp;It&#8217;s an excellent way to give the hiring manager a sense of your unique self, something quite challenging in a resume alone.</p>

								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-links-to-relevant-urls">5. Links to relevant URLs</h2>



<p>It can be stressful for the recruiters to review resumes back-to-back. Try making the hiring manager&#8217;s job easier by making explicit connections between your experiences and the job you want. This includes a link to your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/how-to-make-your-profile-stand-out-on-linkedin/1366/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn profile</a>, your blog, or your online portfolio. Because once they know how you can be helpful to their organization, you&#8217;re more likely to get a job interview.</p>



<p>So, now that you know how to write a great resume, get to work!  Use these amazing career tips to make your resume ready and get yourself one step closer to that dream job.</p>
