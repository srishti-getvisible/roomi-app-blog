										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you’ve ever wandered into the fandom section of the internet then you know that it is intense. The inside jokes, references, costumes, and games look like so much fun and are such a great way to find a community for yourself. There is this bond between the members of any fandom that the devil himself could not break.This is why a movie marathon makes for the perfect roommate bonding activity. It also helps that staying in and watching movies with your roommates is the perfect way to enjoy weekends during the cozy winters.</p>



<p>So, for those of you who want to dip your toes into the world of pop-culture with your friends (or those of you who just want to do some roommate bonding)- this one is for you. We’ve compiled for you a list of the 10 ideas for a great movie marathon to watch with your roommates and enjoy the cozy winters!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Greatest movie marathon of all-time- Star Wars</strong></h2>



<p>Of course, we have to begin with Star Wars. Any film nerd will tell you that the Star Wars series is an absolute must-watch for everyone. Get your roommates together during the cozy winters and put on Stars Wars Episode IV – A New Hope. AND YES THIS IS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE STAR WARS MOVIE TO START A MARATHON WITH. Now that that is out of the way, you and your roommates can sit back and be transported to a galaxy far far away (you know we had to make at least one reference!). For more info on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/tv/news/star-wars/147767-star-wars-machete-best-movie-viewing-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what order to watch the films in check this out.</a></p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. For the movie buffs- <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, don’t freak out- I know doing a movie marathon of LOTR seems like a daunting task- don’t even get us started on the Director’s Cut- but believe me, it’s worth it. It’s mentally/physically taxing to watch this one so maybe pick a long weekend to watch this one. But believe me, it is the perfect way to spend cozy winters! Just sit back and wait and you and your roommates are transported to beautiful Middle Earth!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. For the millenials- <strong>Harry Potter</strong></h2>



<p>We would be surprised if you and your roommates hadn’t already watched all of the Harry Potter movies. But it’s such a fun franchise to revisit that it’s always got a place on Movie Marathon lists. Plus, you and your roommates can take the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/news/discover-your-hogwarts-house-on-wizarding-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pottermore test</a> to figure out which house you belong to. Let the roommate bonding commence!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. For the classy- <strong>James Bond</strong></h2>



<p>Oh la la, now we’re going to class it up a little! James Bond is an extremely fun movie franchise to watch with roommates because you get to debate about who the best James Bond is. Not to mention, you can even pour yourself a little Martini (Shaken, not stirred of course). Nothing like drinking with your roomis to make your winter even cozier. Call it roommate bonding with Bond! Here is a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.techradar.com/in/how-to/how-to-watch-the-james-bond-movies-in-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helpful guide about the order in which to watch them.</a></p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. For the thrill junkies- <strong>Jurassic Park</strong></h2>



<p>Jurassic Park has been the most exciting, and terrifying, series since the first one came out in 1993. There’s a reason it’s one of the most successful movie franchises of all time. So, get your roommates, dim down the lights and start the marathon. Nothing will bond you and your roommates more than being scared together! So, get ready for an intense movie marathon.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. For the intellectuals- <strong>The Matrix</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, the Wachowskis are cinematic geniuses and no one can convince me otherwise. The Matrix trilogy is one of the all-time greatest movies, no questions about it. If you or your roommates haven’t watched this already, then you need to get on it ASAP. This is the best way to spend your cozy winters, by being intellectually challenged. You will have some of the most interesting conversations with your roommates after finishing this trilogy. This will definitely take your roommate bonding experience to a whole different level!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. For the action fans- <strong>Mad Max</strong></h2>



<p>Mad Max is one of those franchises that although is pretty successful, not many people have actually watched it in its entirety. And it’s time to change that. It’s got incredible action sequences and brilliant performances from the cast. It’s one of the most riveting dystopian movie franchises of all time and is PERFECT for the cozy winters. Buckle in and get ready for a thrilling movie marathon.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. For the laughs- <strong>The Hangover</strong></h2>



<p>You know what they say- laughter is the best medicine- even if the disease is the crushing winters. Everyone needs a good laugh every now and then and The Hangover films deliver just that. You and your roommates are in for a treat and who knows, maybe y’all will form a bond like Phil, Alan and Stu (but hopefully more happy).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. For the Comic book fans- <strong>Christopher Nolan’s Batman Trilogy</strong></h2>



<p>We probably don’t even need to explain this one, it’s pretty clear why everyone needs to watch this trilogy. What Nolan brings to Batman is something very unique and not to be missed. And plus, you and your roommates can discuss just how brilliant Heath Ledger was as The Joker.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. For visual effects- <strong>Planet of the Apes</strong></h2>



<p>You and your roommates should watch The Planet of the Apes just to appreciate how far visual effects have gone in movies. It is absolutely stunning. The movies deal with the relationship between humans, nature, and technology. All topics that are coming up more and moreover the last decade.

<p>For <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.usa.com/rank/us--average-snow--state-rank.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost 40 states</a> in the US, winter means freezing temperatures and snow. Thus, convincing yourself to take up the prospect of moving during the winter can be more overwhelming than exciting. Naturally, the majority of moving days take place in summer. A lot of parents&#8217; schedule moves around the time their kids are home. There are also fresh college students moving to their respective college towns. There&#8217;s a bunch of reasons why winter moving is useful. Here are some of our best moving-in-the-winter tips for those of you looking to save!</p>



<p>If you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/healthy-living-for-you-and-your-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">find yourself wanting to avoid the restlessness</a> that comes with house shifting in the summer. And if you want to catch discounted prices on movers and packers, we recommend moving in the winter!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-should-i-consider-moving-in-the-winter">Why should I consider moving in the winter?</h2>



<p>We wouldn&#8217;t blame you for not wanting to do this at first. On a cold day, nothing is more appealing than a day spent with Netflix, snuggled up in a blanket with hot cocoa. But there are so many benefits to be had when you decide to move in winter &#8211; including cash-saving opportunities! If you manage your time and plan your move in advance, you might just pull this off.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-oh-the-money-you-will-save">#1 Oh, the money you will save</h3>



<p>Like most businesses, the movers &amp; packers industry also has a certain ebb and flow to it. Their peak season is warm summers. And business slows down during the transitional months and in winters, the industry witnesses quite the decrease. Due to this decrease in demand, most of these businesses (especially the local ones) also slash their prices. You see where we&#8217;re going with this.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>But that&#8217;s not all&#8230; winters also mean a decrease in the price for storage units, if you find yourself in a situation where you need extra storage between moves.</p>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-tips-on-how-to-save-money-while-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Want more discounts?</a> (Well, duh, of course,<em> you do.</em>) Schedule your move mid-week (i.e., not at the weekend) and towards the middle of the month. That&#8217;s when <a href="https://serenitymovingservices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moving company</a> schedules are typically the lightest given general rent cycle trends.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-the-sweet-ease-of-moving-in-the-winter">#2 The sweet ease of moving in the winter</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re not in the suburbs, house shifting during peak seasons can be a pain in the butt. Even those who schedule their move months in advance are faced with things like last moment cancellations.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Oh, and trying to haul stuff by yourself in and out of self-storage is no fun either.</p>



<p>Moving in the winters ultimately means scheduling your move around your preferred dates and not the mover&#8217;s. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-tell-roommates-moving-out/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">This means you&#8217;ll have more freedom when it comes to the move</a> and even last-minute scheduling could run smoothly (although we don&#8217;t recommend you risk it). It also means less traffic if you&#8217;re on a long journey!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-increased-safety-for-your-belongings">#3 Increased safety for your belongings</h3>



<p>Most of the U.S. also experiences scorching temperatures in the summer. And let&#8217;s not forget that the temperatures we experience outside are <em>nothing</em> compared to those we experience sitting in a car/moving truck. But that&#8217;s not all, you can drastically lower the risk of ruining the things you own as a summer move might turn into a melted oil painting, vinyl record, or those homemade candles and soaps your sister made for you on your birthday ?</p>

<p>Turns out, you might just find yourself being grateful for the temperature in winter, as it would also mean no extra-extra packing for the perishables!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-however">However&#8230;</h2>



<p>We know reading this may have filled you with all the confidence you need to give moving in the winter a shot. But (and we can&#8217;t press on this enough) DO NOT forget to exercise some good old-fashioned caution when you&#8217;re planning your winter move. Some moving-in-the-winter tips we highly recommend include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Check the weather report extensively, especially when it gets closer to your house shifting date.</li>



<li>If you&#8217;re moving from a non-snow region to a place where it snows, ask your realtor/landlord/neighbors if the roads are salted quickly after a storm.</li>



<li>Ensure that none of your stuff is exposed to open air, just in case it snows or rains.</li>
</ul>
