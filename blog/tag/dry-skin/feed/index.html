<p>Brrr! Snow is beginning to fall and the winter winds are picking up, which means it&#8217;s the season of dry skin and flushed faces. With the winter season upon us, it’s time to start taking our skincare activities seriously and giving our skin some much-needed TLC!</p>



<p>Colder temperatures and frigid air lead to red, irritated, and dry skin. Not to mention that spending time inside in heated areas takes the moisture out of our skin as well. Between the brisk weather and our heaters set to high, it feels as if there is no escape from skin-attacking conditions.</p>



<p>Not to worry, there are numerous skincare activities that you can use to keep your skin healthy and fresh looking. Use these skincare tips daily to beat dry, irritated, and red winter skin.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!</h2>



<p>First and foremost, moisturizing your skin should be #1 on your winter to-do list! You must moisturize your face (and body!) during the winter months to prevent your skin from becoming dry and flakey.</p>



<p>Be sure to moisturize your face every day after you wash it to retain moisture. Not to mention that moisturizing your face is also helpful for those who have acne-prone skin!</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t forget to moisturize your hands every time you wash them, too. Washing your hands will quickly dry them out during the winter months, so it&#8217;s important to keep putting cream on them no matter how tedious it may be. Keep hand cream in each bathroom of your house to get into the habit of moisturizing after washing your hands!</p>



<p>Lastly, be sure to invest in a face and body cream that’s right for you. If your skin is especially sensitive, talk to your dermatologist before buying any skincare product.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Eat a balanced diet and drink plenty of water</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-clean-eating-programs-try-roommate-year/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eating right and drinking enough water is not only important for maintaining a healthy body</a>, but for maintaining healthy skin, too.</p>



<p>Not only does proper nutrition help to keep skin clear for those who have acne-prone skin, but it also helps to keep skin moisturized. Eating healthy food and drinking enough water is the natural solution to skincare.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Invest in a humidifier</h2>



<p>Since our skin is constantly exposed to cool air outdoors and dry heat inside during the winter months, it’s a good idea to invest in a humidifier for your room or office. A humidifier will help your skin to retain the much-needed moisture that&#8217;s lost during the cold winter months.</p>



<p>And, even though it’s tempting to crank up the heat when it’s chilly out, make sure you turn down your thermostat to save your skin. High heat will increase dryness in the air and therefore take away more moisture from the skin, making your skin even more irritated.</p>



<p>So, next time you&#8217;re tempted to turn up the heat, remember to follow your skincare routine and keep the thermostat lower!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use the right skincare products</h2>



<p>Finally, be sure to find the best skincare products for <em>you</em>. Everyone’s skin is different. Whether it’s oily, dry, or acne-prone, we all have different skincare needs. To truly understand your skin, visit your dermatologist or take a skincare quiz online to better understand your body’s needs.</p>

<p>Ditch the fruity scented skincare products and instead opt for fragrance-free and alcohol-free products. Products with fragrance often contain ingredients that will irritate the skin, making your winter skin even worse.</p>



<p>Finally, using less is often more! There’s no need to overdo it with the face wash when washing your face, a little goes a long way. Using too much facewash can also contribute to dry and irritated skin.</p>
