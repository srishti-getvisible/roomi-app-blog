<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Buffalo, NY</h2>



<p>The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the Native Americans of the Iroquois tribe and later by French colonizers. Some say its name came from the French calling it &#8220;Beau Fleuve&#8221; which is French &#8220;Beautiful River.&#8221; Others argue that the name came from the American Buffalo that may have roamed the area in the past. Buffalo is famous for its winters and has four distinct seasons. Spring is usually cool and rainy while summer and autumn are warm and pleasant.</p>
