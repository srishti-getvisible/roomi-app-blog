<p>Whether you were lured by the famed <em><a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-apizza-4797967">Apizza</a></em> or the Ivy League education, moving to The Elm City is full of surprises. Here’s everything you need to know about finding rooms for rent in New Haven.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know New Haven</h2>



<p>When talking about New Haven, two things come to mind: pizza and crime. While they are drastically different, any conversation about New Haven will eventually lead to these topics. If you’re concerned about crime rates in New Haven, you wouldn’t be the only one. Like most other cities, New Haven has its share of petty thefts and even robberies. However, as you explore the city some more, it won&#8217;t be long until you let down your guard and realize New Haven has a lot to offer.</p>

<p>The hype around Ivy League education and gothic architecture surrounding the Yale campus may make you think of New Haven as a snooze fest, but you couldn’t be farther from the truth. New Haven is filled with opportunities for you to meet new people, explore live music and theatre, and even grab falafels at midnight.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding rooms for rent in New Haven</h2>



<p>Living in New Haven isn’t cheap, with the average rent in New Haven being <a href="https://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator/Connecticut-New-Haven" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">35% higher</a> than the national average. Property taxes are high, along with higher utility and transit bills. However, with some smart budgeting, and the lucrative salary that most New haven job opportunities offer, it&#8217;s not too difficult to manage. With tons of people moving to the city every year, the attraction of looking for rooms for rent in New Haven is clear.</p>

<p>New Haven has an average <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/CT/New_Haven">walk score of 68</a>, with some neighborhoods being more walkable than others. Downtown, Wooster Square, and Dwight are the most walkable neighborhoods in the city, where most errands can be completed on foot.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Roads/traffic in New Haven</h3>



<p>Connecticut has bad traffic, so it is not surprising to see that rush hour in New Haven can make your move at a snail’s pace. If you want to reach anywhere in time, avoid planning any events close to rush hours.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public transportation in New Haven</h3>



<p>Although most of Downtown is quite walkable, for other neighborhoods, residents can opt for <a href="https://www.cttransit.com/schedules" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT Transit</a> buses, or if you’re close to the Yale campus, you can try <a href="https://your.yale.edu/work-yale/campus-services/parking-and-transportation-options/shuttle">Yale Shuttles</a> as well.</p>



<p>To connect to other cities, residents have <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/stations/nhv" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Amtrak</a>, <a href="https://shorelineeast.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shore Line East,</a> or <a href="https://www.mta.info/mnr" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metro-North Railroad</a> which provides easy access to various destinations from New Haven, such as New York, Boston, Queens, and New London.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Airports in New Haven</h3>

Once you fly to Philadelphia from New Haven, you can connect to any destination via American Airlines. Its proximity to New York City means you can also opt for <a href="https://www.jfkairport.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">John F. Kennedy Airport</a>, provided you don’t mind a longer journey.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Cycling in New Haven</h3>



<p>New Haven has been working steadily to ensure the safety of cyclists by improving signage and road infrastructure. From launching a “<a href="https://www.newhavenct.gov/gov/depts/traffic/street_smarts/what_is_street_smarts_.htm" class="broken_link">Street Smarts</a>” campaign to starting New Haven’s very own bike-sharing program known as <a href="https://www.bikenewhavenct.com/">Bike New Haven</a>, the city is on its way to becoming more cycle-friendly. You can also view the official&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newhavenct.gov/gov/depts/traffic/bike_new_haven/bike_map.htm" class="broken_link">Bike Route Map</a>&nbsp;to track the existing and upcoming biking routes in the city.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Restaurants in New Haven</h2>



<p>You can’t talk about New Haven without mentioning pizza! New Haven is often accredited with <a href="http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/pizza_a_new_haven_love_story/#:~:text=Pizza%2C%20A%20Love%20Story%20begins,Street%2C%20but%20rather%20several%20decades" class="broken_link">introducing pizza to America</a>, or <em>“apizza”,</em> but that is not all that New Haven offers. While classics like hamburgers and ooey-gooey grilled cheese sandwiches are what New Haven is famous for, you will find opportunities to explore other cuisines as well. As the city is more of a college town, you will find several places to drink and hang out with friends, but there is a nice selection of fine dining as well. Of course, Pizza Parlours are still famous, and when you live here long enough, you&#8217;ll have to declare your allegiance to some joint or the other!</p>
