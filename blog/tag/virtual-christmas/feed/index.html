										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Christmas behind closed doors would have been unthinkable last year, but that doesn’t mean that you can&#8217;t spread Christmas cheer with your loved ones this year. A global pandemic may be to blame for changing tradition, but it’s our&nbsp;<em>responsibility</em>&nbsp;to deal with it&nbsp;<strong>the right way</strong>. The answer the most fun virtual Christmas party ideas you can imagine! Whether you need company Christmas party ideas or Christmas party food ideas, we got you!</p>



<p>All you need is a positive attitude and enough enthusiasm to throw a virtual Christmas party. An online party is great to build connections and keep family and work ties solid, no matter how far away the guests are. The possibilities for a virtual Christmas party are&nbsp;<em>virtually</em>&nbsp;endless. You can adapt any of the ideas below to suit your guests and keep the festive cheer flowing throughout.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Virtual Christmas Party idea #1: A Virtual costume party</h2>



<p>This is one game the entire family can participate in, but be sure to give them enough notice so they can prepare their costumes! The kids will especially enjoy this party, and you can kick it up a notch by giving away prizes for the best dressed, most interesting costume, most colorful, and so on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CkLPHBIt0e"><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/christmas-gift-ideas-under-50-roomi/">Christmas Gift Ideas Under $50</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Christmas Gift Ideas Under $50&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog" src="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/christmas-gift-ideas-under-50-roomi/embed/#?secret=CkLPHBIt0e" data-secret="CkLPHBIt0e" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Virtual Christmas Party idea #2: Secret Santa</h2>



<p>This game requires you to plan well in advance. We know that<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/stores-in-new-york-city-for-the-sustainable-shopper-roomi-2/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gift-giving can be challenging </a>when you are celebrating at a distance, so you can buy and ship gifts to your loved ones and open them together in real-time. You can mutually decide on the budget for each gift and then send everyone a family member&#8217;s name so that they can buy them something to cheer them up! It&#8217;s best to decide a few weeks in advance so that everyone can make sure their gifts arrive on time.</p>



<p>On the day, get everyone to take turns opening their gift in front of the camera so the others can see the expression on their faces. The challenge for them is to figure out who their Secret Santa is. This game is fun, and an excellent way to add a little bit of excitement to your celebration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Virtual Christmas Party idea #3: Organize a remote potluck</h2>



<p>Food brings the family closer and is a big part of family get-togethers, especially at Christmas. Even in a virtual Christmas celebration, remember that you can still eat as a family from a distance. </p>



<p>For a remote &#8216;potluck,&#8217; ask everyone to prepare their favorite meal to enjoy together.  This is a great way to share Christmas party food ideas as well. You can challenge each person to showcase their plate and share the recipe with the rest of the family. Easy, breezy <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-celebrate-enjoy-christmas-on-a-budget-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for you and your pocket this festive season!</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Christmas cocktails or mocktails</h2>



<p>If having a hot beverage is a tradition in your family, you can still enjoy this virtually! Ask everyone to create their <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/holidays/christmas-ideas/g24/christmas-cocktails/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite cocktail/mocktail </a>and share the recipe with everyone else. If your extended family is large, you could consider creating a family cocktail recipe book and distributing it to everyone after the event!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Time for some carols!</h2>



<p>A virtual Christmas celebration wouldn&#8217;t be complete without <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2016/12/22/top-18-christmas-carols-ranked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carols and a singalong.</a> Ask all members to send their favorite Christmas carol ahead of time to ensure everyone gets to enjoy their favorite song. If you have musicians in your family, encourage them to form a virtual band to make your singalong more special.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Virtual talent show</h2>



<p>There are fewer opportunities for one-on-one conversations in virtual parties. Keeping that in mind, hosting a talent show can be an excellent idea to keep the family engaged and entertained. Give everyone a few weeks of prep time to prepare a song, dance, or skit, and give them their 5 minutes of fame this Christmas!</p>
