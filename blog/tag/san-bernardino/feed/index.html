<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know San Bernardino</h2>



<p>San Bernardino was originally occupied by indigenous tribespeople who referred to the valley as the &#8220;Cupped Hand of God.&#8221; The town of San Bernardino was established in 1851, and San Bernardino County was formed in 1853. Lying by the foothills, the city is bordered by the San Bernardino Mountains and the San Bernardino National Forest. Residents experience a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and hot, dry summers. However, winters here are colder than in most other South Californian cities. Expect freezing temperatures, frost, and even light snowfall around January.</p>
