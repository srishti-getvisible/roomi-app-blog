<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Kansas City</h2>



<p>Kansas City was officially recognized as a town on June 1, 1850, and as a city on March 28, 1853. Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont was the first European visitor and explorer to arrive. Kansas City lies between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers. Hence its location was seen as ideal for a settlement. If you are looking for rooms for rent in Kansas City, keep in mind it experiences a continental climate. As there are no major water bodies nearby, it experiences extreme hot and cold swings throughout the year.</p>
