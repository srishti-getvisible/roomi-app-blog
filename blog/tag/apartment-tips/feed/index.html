<p>Apartments come in different shapes and sizes. If you&#8217;re not used to the terminology, it may be difficult to keep track of what&#8217;s what. One common choice people have to make during their apartment search is between a high-rise vs low-rise apartment. Though most people love an apartment with a view, they may not fit with your apartment and lifestyle. So, let&#8217;s look at the pros and cons between the two and determine which one is best for you!</p>

<p></p>



<p>Imagine a flight of 200 stairs and a building with 10 stories. That&#8217;s what a high-rise building looked like in ancient Rome. Luckily, they now come with elevators to make going up and down easier.</p>



<p>The difference between a high-rise and low-rise apartment is in their height. If it&#8217;s at least 7 stories tall, it&#8217;s a high-rise apartment. Otherwise, it is a low-rise apartment. High-rise apartments can also go as high as 20-30 stories, and give that feeling of being above the world, and beyond the anyone&#8217;s reach.</p>

<p>While each has its perks over the other, your eventual choice will depend on personal preference. Let&#8217;s take a look at the pros and cons of high-rise vs low-rise apartments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-of-high-rise-apartments"><strong>Pros of High-Rise Apartments</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Stunning views</strong></p>



<p>High-rise apartments offer stunning views of any city, allowing you to see far and wide and with the radiance of natural light. It’s the kind of scenery that‘ll leave an impression on you every time.</p>



<p><strong>Additional security</strong></p>



<p>Most high-rise buildings come with a doorman, security, and other staff, which can make living in the apartment easier and safer.</p>



<p><strong>More Lease Options</strong></p>



<p>You’re more likely to find a lease in a high-rise apartment than you would in a low-rise. So if you&#8217;re looking to get settled quickly, an high-rise building is most likely where you&#8217;ll land.</p>



<p><strong>Easier to settle down</strong></p>



<p>Most high-rise apartments come with pre-installed utilities like cable, internet, and the like. This makes it easy to start enjoying your home once you move in.</p>



<p><strong>Quick maintenance fixes</strong></p>



<p>It’s also easy to get repairs and maintenance done because most high-rise apartments have an on-site property management office to handle such requests.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cons-of-high-rise-apartments"><strong>Cons of High-Rise Apartments</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>



<p>Often, high-rise apartments are more expensive because of their locations.</p>



<p><strong>Emergency</strong></p>



<p>In cases of emergency, living in a high-rise building will make getting to safety difficult compared to living in a low-rise apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-of-low-rise-apartments"><strong>Pros of Low-Rise Apartments</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Easy street access</strong></p>



<p>You’ll have quick access to the street level if you stay in a low-rise apartment. This is especially important if you live with an elderly or disabled person or in the event of an emergency.</p>



<p><strong>More amenities</strong></p>



<p>Low-rise apartments usually have more <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-amenities-when-renting-in-nyc/">amenities</a>, like pools, gardens, clubhouses, and more parking spaces. And all these amenities available with the apartment are relatively cheaper than those of a high-rise apartment.</p>



<p><strong>Peaceful location</strong></p>



<p>You’ll find low-rise apartments in peaceful, outer residential neighborhoods. Yes, it is often some distance from the city center meaning longer commute times However, it more than makes up for this setback with less traffic congestion, cleaner environments, and a greater sense of community.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cons-of-low-rise-apartments"><strong>Cons of Low-Rise Apartments</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Views</strong></p>



<p>The views from a low-rise apartment are often not as stunning as those from a high-rise condo.</p>



<p><strong>Congested spaces</strong></p>



<p>Shared corridors and hallways in low-rise apartments could lead to more congestion at busier times in the day. This may not be ideal if you like your privacy.</p>

<p>In deciding on what floor you want to live on, it’s important to remember that some of the pros of each apartment type may be lost depending on your floor. By this, we mean that the difference between a high-rise and low-rise apartment is influenced by the floor on which you stay. So there’s no single answer to this question. Rather, it must be decided on an apartment-by-apartment basis.</p>



<p>For example, living on a low level of a high-rise condo may give you as much access to the street as a low-rise apartment. Conversely, staying at the highest level of a low-rise apartment may offer you a better view of the city than the first floor of a high-rise building.</p>



<p>So which one is better between a high-rise vs low-rise apartment? This is a question you must ask and answer yourself based on your preferences and budget. Once you’ve decided, check out our (Roomi) collection of high-rise and low-rise rental apartments to find those that fit your budget.</p>

<p>When choosing an apartment, you&#8217;ll come across just about everything. Modern, quirky, old, new, odd&#8230;and perfect. Out of all the different types of apartments, the two most likely to come up in your search are the 1-bedroom apartment and the studio apartment. Both have a lot in common, with their own distinct advantages and downfalls. Let&#8217;s examine studio vs. 1-bedroom apartments so you can decide on the right choice for you.</p>

<p>A studio apartment is designed as a single large room with all you need in one living area. It combines the living room, bedroom, and dining area in open floor space (with no adjoining walls between). That is aside from your bathroom, which is &#8211; thankfully &#8211; in a separate room.</p>



<p>A studio is an amazing choice for someone who wants to live alone, likes open, airy space, and is looking to save some money off the rent. Additionally, studio apartments don&#8217;t need a lot of furniture to feel complete. This makes them pretty perfect for someone who is just starting life on their own.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a fun fact. While the studio is essentially an open space, the storage space inside it is limited. Okay, maybe it&#8217;s not so fun, but if you&#8217;re someone with many belongings, you should keep an eye out for studios with larger storage spaces that can take your things.</p>



<p>Also, studio apartments are not ideal for most couples, especially if you need some privacy now and again.</p>

<p>A 1-bedroom apartment is carved out by walls into smaller rooms. Your bedroom is a separate room, rather than having a bed in the living space. The kitchen may also be its own room, but some 1-bedroom apartments have an open-plan kitchen and living area.</p>



<p>Generally, 1-bedroom apartments are typically more spacious. Do you like to have friends over, need some privacy or just think you&#8217;d go stir-crazy with only one room in the home? A 1-bedroom apartment will be better than a studio apartment for you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-studio-vs-1-bedroom-apartment-any-difference">A Studio vs 1 Bedroom Apartment: Any Difference?</h2>



<p>First, in comparing a studio vs 1 bedroom apartment, a defining difference is that the 1-bedroom has a separate bedroom area that is closed off from the living area and kitchen. On the other hand, a studio apartment is a self-contained space that houses everything in a single large room.</p>

<p>Beyond the wall partitions and space cordoning, there are several factors to consider when comparing a studio vs 1 bedroom apartment. Let&#8217;s break down all the important stuff.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: Getting a studio is cheaper than getting a 1-bedroom apartment because it has less space. You might find that a studio apartment helps you save a few hundred dollars, for a more manageable lifestyle.</li><li><strong>Utility bills</strong>: Again, more space means more utilities and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-amenities-when-renting-in-nyc/">amenities</a>. More utilities mean more bills for heating, lights, more electrical outlets, etc. You’re likely to incur more utility bills if you decide to stay in a 1-bedroom apartment instead of a studio.</li><li><strong>Cleaning and Decorating</strong>: It’s always going to be easier to clean an apartment with a smaller space. The same goes with decorating as there’ll be fewer walls to fill up.</li><li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: If you like to be on your own or with one other person you’re very comfortable around, a studio apartment might be enough. But if you like to have friends over for dinner, you may need a larger space, making a 1-bedroom apartment a better option.</li><li><strong>Occupancy</strong>: When more than one person occupies a studio apartment, it can feel cramped. A 1-bedroom apartment offers more in terms of space (both storage and general) and comfort for people.</li><li><strong>Remote work</strong>: If you work from home, you&#8217;ll probably find a studio apartment just doesn&#8217;t cut it. It&#8217;s not ideal to eat, sleep, work and relax in the same room every day. Especially when you have to do it all from your bed. Alternatively, a 1-bedroom apartment allows you room to move around and catch your breath.</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Whatever option you choose between the studio and a one-bedroom apartment, the location will affect the price. Even though studios are generally cheaper, you&#8217;ll save money on a one-bedroom apartment if you move away from the action.</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-right-for-you">So Which is Right for You?</h2>



<p>There’s no straight answer to this question. Whether you choose a studio apartment or a 1-bedroom apartment depends on what matters to you. Weigh up your personal preferences, budget and living expectations. Then, you can decide on which of the spaces fits your needs.</p>



<p>Whatever your preference is, the earlier you start your search, the better. Ready to find that suitable studio apartment or one-bedroom in minutes? Let <a href="http://roomiapp.com">Roomi</a> help you.</p>

<p>Apartment-hunting is not an easy task, but knowing which kind you want of the many types of apartments can make your experience much easier. How many bedrooms do you need? How about a backyard space? Or maybe a shared living space? There are many things to consider! So, don&#8217;t forget to factor in everything you need while knowing more about these 10 different types of apartments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-studio">1. Studio</h3>



<p>A studio is one of the most common apartment styles since it only consists of one room. It has an open floor plan with the bedroom, living room, and kitchen in one space. A studio is one of the most common apartment styles since it only consists of one room. It has an open floor plan with the bedroom, living room, and kitchen in one space. For those looking to personalize their space, using an <a href="https://www.canva.com/create/floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">online floor plan maker</a> can help devise the perfect layout fitting individual needs.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Alcove Studio:</strong> An alcove studio is a variation of the regular studio, but with an L partition in the living room. This creates a more private space and is a perfect nook for a bed or a desk.</li>



<li><strong>Convertible Studio and Apartment:</strong> From the name itself, a convertible studio is a different type of studio with more space. This apartment-style is big enough to construct a wall to create a bedroom. On the other hand, there&#8217;s enough space to make a secondary room in a convertible apartment. In general, a convertible apartment can have two bedrooms, while the studio can only have one bedroom.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-micro-apartment">2. Micro Apartment</h3>



<p>Similar to a studio, a micro-apartment has one room that&#8217;s only around 350 square feet. This type of apartment has space for sleeping, sitting, a small bathroom, and a kitchenette. Usually, micro-units have flexible furniture like a foldable bed or kitchen table to maximize space.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-junior-1-bedroom">3. Junior 1-Bedroom</h3>



<p>In simple terms, a junior 1-bedroom is a medium-sized apartment. It differs from a studio with its size and separated bedroom from the living area. Of all the types of apartments, this apartment-style is simple and has enough space for most!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-loft">4. Loft</h3>



<p>A loft is a type of apartment with a high ceiling. It&#8217;s one large room with big windows and a full sleeping and kitchen area. These types of apartment styles are similar to studios and are usually converted into residential spaces from historic warehouses.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for shared living spaces but with your own privacy, a duplex or a triplex could be the apartment style for you. Plus, these types of apartments are perfect for families or a group of friends.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Duplex</strong>: A duplex typically has two separate units with their own entrances. It can be side-by-side or with a second level.</li>



<li><strong>Triplex</strong>: Similarly, a triplex has three units rather than two. It also has three separate entrances, but the size of the units are usually the same.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-garden-apartment">6. Garden Apartment</h3>



<p>This type of apartment is on the ground floor with direct access to a backyard or garden area. A garden apartment is normally in a smaller apartment community that&#8217;s surrounded by garden space.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-railroad-apartment">7. Railroad Apartment</h3>



<p>Often found in smaller and older buildings, a railroad apartment is less common in all apartment styles. It consists of three or four rooms connected without a hallway, forming a thin rectangle and resembling a train passenger car.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-walk-up-apartment">8. Walk-up Apartment</h3>



<p>A walk-up is a type of apartment where you have to use stairs to access the building. Buildings with a walk-up apartment are small and normally don&#8217;t have elevators. So, there are fewer tenants in this apartment-style.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-co-op-apartment">9. Co-Op Apartment</h3>



<p>Called a housing cooperative (&#8220;co-op&#8221;), this is a housing community where a group of people owns a property together. With shared living spaces, everyone can live in the property as long as they share in paying for it!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-penthouse">10. Penthouse</h3>



<p>Lastly, a penthouse is an apartment on the top-most floor of a building. It&#8217;s the most luxurious, among all types of apartments, typically large in size. Some even have a private elevator to reach the unit. Often, a penthouse features an outstanding view of the city and is expensive.</p>

<p>Before anything, it&#8217;s important to understand what a lease agreement is and what it means. Essentially, when signing the document, both you and your landlord agree to fulfill certain responsibilities. This typically includes details of what your landlord will provide, when your rent should be paid, and any house rules.</p>



<p>You might feel you can still back out of the lease if you haven&#8217;t moved in yet. But the reality is that when you&#8217;re breaking a lease before moving in, you&#8217;re actually violating a legally binding document. Because you signed the contract, you agreed to be subject to the lease&#8217;s terms, conditions, and financial obligations.</p>



<p>Some tenants might try to invoke their &#8220;right to rescind,&#8221; but this doesn&#8217;t really apply when renting an apartment. This basically refers to a borrower&#8217;s right to cancel certain types of loans after three days. Also, there&#8217;s no 24-hour &#8220;cooling-off&#8221; policy that you can use to cancel the contract.</p>



<p>Check if your lease agreement contains a termination clause. It should have clearly defined guidelines on what you&#8217;re entitled to in case you want to cancel your lease before moving in. Your landlord might also ask you to submit a 30-day notice before you officially break the lease. This gives your landlord time to look for a new tenant to rent the space.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-can-you-expect-from-your-landlord-when-you-re-breaking-a-lease-before-moving-in">What can you expect from your landlord when you&#8217;re breaking a lease before moving in?</h2>



<p>First of all, both you and the landlord should refer back to the apartment lease agreement before taking action. This contract serves as a guide to what you&#8217;re supposed to do.</p>



<p>The landlord should properly explain what you are entitled to and what your legal obligations are. Most states insist that landlords make a good-faith effort to find a new tenant as soon as possible. This means that you, as the existing tenant, should continue paying your dues until the property is re-rented.</p>



<p>You might have a perfectly valid reason for needing to cancel your lease before moving in. It might be something entirely beyond your control. You may have lost your source of income or encountered a medical emergency, making it hard to pay rent. Unfortunately, in these cases, it&#8217;s still up to your landlord to decide whether to let you off the hook.</p>

<p>Once a new renter signs a lease agreement, your lease is no longer valid. Until that time, you&#8217;re expected to continue paying rent. Note that if you don&#8217;t pay your debt, your landlord could bring the matter to court.</p>



<p>Your landlord might have asked you to sign an early lease termination letter. This is basically an additional section or clause that&#8217;s added to a lease agreement. It also acts as your landlord&#8217;s memo of what you need to do and by when, since you&#8217;re breaking a lease before moving in.</p>



<p>This letter is a requirement in most states so that the termination of the lease becomes valid. It should include the reason behind needing to cancel your lease before moving in. This document should also list the fees you need to pay and how these will be collected. Without this letter, the issue could be brought to court. If it&#8217;s not required by the state, then your landlord might waive this requirement.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-about-the-security-deposit">What about the security deposit?</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ve probably thought about your security deposit, too. Before moving in, you paid this fee that&#8217;s usually equivalent to two or three months&#8217; rent. When breaking a lease, your security deposit can be used to pay for damages or repairs on the property. It can also be used for cleaning expenses, replacing keys, or for your back rent.</p>



<p>When breaking a lease before moving in, you need to follow standard protocol, like paying a fee or forfeiting your security deposit. This is all part of the process of terminating the lease early.</p>



<p>Until a new renter is found, your landlord can apply the security deposit to cover your rent. They can then give you anything left over once someone new moves in.</p>



<p>Your landlord could also collect your rent and give you back the deposit once a new renter is found. Since you didn&#8217;t occupy the apartment anyway, you should get it back in full. Your landlord should only tap into the security deposit if you fail to pay your rent.</p>

<p>Yes. When you fail to pay rent on top of breaking a lease, your landlord may be forced to take legal action. And if your landlord wins the case, a collection agency may take on the unpaid debt. Unless you pay up or come to a settlement, breaking a lease before moving in will impact your credit score.</p>

<p>We hope this article has answered everything you need to know about breaking a lease before moving in. At the end of the day, nobody plans on intentionally breaking a lease after poring through endless listings for the perfect apartment. Whatever the reason, whether within or beyond your control, there are agreements in place for a reason.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Roomi comes with practical features to help add some wiggle room for tenants. If you need to <a href="https://roomiapp.com/policies/cancellation-policy" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">cancel your accommodation</a>, you&#8217;ll be entitled to a full or partial refund of your first rental payment minus any applicable service fees. Note that this will depend on the kind of cancellation policy that your landlord selected. While this policy doesn&#8217;t necessarily terminate your lease agreement, it does offer additional protection if you have a change of plans.</p>



<p>Want to learn more? You can read all about how each cancellation policy works by visiting the Roomi website. As a Roomi user, you can also make use of the built-in messaging feature on the app or site. Use it to ask your landlord any queries about your agreement before signing a lease.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-get-a-tiny-house">3. Get a Tiny House</h2>



<p>Ever since the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny-house_movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tiny-house movement</a> began, lots of Americans have embraced the minimalist lifestyle to downsize their housing space along with their living expenses. A professionally made tiny house can include all the amenities of a regular house smartly arranged in a cozy space. It can be customized according to the needs of one person or an entire family. It is generally constructed on wheels to move around and shift localities with ease.</p>



<p>Multiple states in the US have <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/livable-tiny-house-communities-3984833" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tiny-house communities</a>&#8211; Florida, Texas, California, and Colorado are among them. Tiny houses are one of the brilliant alternatives to renting an apartment because of the flexibility they offer. Yes, you may have to make an investment initially but throughout the years it can turn out to be quite rewarding. The value of the tiny house can go up with time. Eventually, you may even sell it off at a higher price than your initial investment.</p>

<p>The above options may be quite overwhelming if you are not the traveling type. You don’t always need to travel the world as alternatives to paying rent. Instead, you can try shared living spaces. Co-living spaces or housing co-ops have become sustainable and cheap housing alternatives.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-house-sitting">6. House-sitting</h2>



<p>Often when people sell their houses, the property remains vacant for a long time. In such cases, the house can become vulnerable to theft and squatters. House-sitters are quite in-demand to keep these homes &#8220;occupied&#8221;. House sitters are allowed to stay in these houses rent-free while the house is on market. In some cases, you may even get paid for house-sitting.</p>

<p>There are lots of things to think about before actually reaching the stage of moving your furniture in. You seriously don&#8217;t want to be stuck in the middle of a chaotic situation while moving your things, do you? Here&#8217;s a few things you can do before you make your move:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-marie-kondo-that-clutter">1. Marie-Kondo that clutter</h3>



<p>We understand how difficult it is to move once you&#8217;ve got used to living in a certain space over a prolonged period of time. People get attached to almost everything, and the contents of your home is the biggest example of that. The first stage of downsizing and moving is to declutter. So, go ahead and Marie-Kondo the clothes you never wear at the bottom of your closet. Get rid of the stuff lurking under your bed that you haven&#8217;t touched in years. You might have to shed some tears, but we swear it&#8217;ll be worth it in the end!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-take-note-of-the-measurements">2. Take note of the measurements!</h3>



<p>You may find rooms for rent with a floor plan that&#8217;s different from what you&#8217;re used to. So before downsizing to an apartment, measure everything you want to take with you. That way, you&#8217;ll know whether you need to adjust things or not. Start with the measurements of your new house, and then measure your major pieces of furniture. And the minibar? Well, if it&#8217;s a must-have for you &#8211; measure it!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-keep-your-essentials-where-you-can-easily-get-them">3. Keep your essentials where you can easily get them</h3>



<p>A lot of people overlook this point and pack everything together. But one of the best tips for downsizing is to keep some of the things you need in readily accessible boxes. It&#8217;s not a great feeling when you&#8217;re craving some food and all your utensils and glasses are packed away with the kitchenware. Also, don&#8217;t forget to keep your first aid kit within arm&#8217;s reach! You&#8217;ll never know when you need it, and it&#8217;s always better to be prepared.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-stay-calm-you-ve-done-harder-things-than-this">4. Stay calm &#8211; you’ve done harder things than this!</h3>

<p>If you still have some time to spare, plan out your process of moving from house to apartment. Maybe you can move a few of the smaller pieces of furniture in for the first few days and the bigger items last. For example, you could move in a bedside table and a few chairs, then move the closet and kitchen table later. However, bringing plants in early can help them acclimatize to your new home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-use-the-stuff-that-you-keep-for-guests">5. Use the stuff that you keep for guests</h3>



<p>When downsizing to an apartment, using the stuff (especially crockery) that you usually reserve for guests can be extra helpful! This way, you can minimize the amount of stuff that you are moving, and create more shelf space!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-keep-singles-in-your-socks-in-case-you-re-strapped-for-cash">6. Keep singles in your socks in case you’re strapped for cash!</h3>



<p>Packing and moving might take a significant amount of planning and expenses, especially if you&#8217;re downsizing to an apartment. However, it&#8217;s also crucial that you have extra money to hand in case push comes to shove. Your budget should always have an upper limit that accounts for extras if something unexpected happens. For that reason, we strongly advise planning and saving up for the move.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-it-s-your-home-let-people-know-that">7. It’s y<em>our home &#8211;</em> let people know that</h3>



<p>Downsizing from a house to an apartment needn&#8217;t be dull. Whatever space you have to work with, don&#8217;t forget to add a touch of your own personal style. This will instantly make your new place feel more like home. Put up a painting. Get new planters. Paint the town red!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-use-every-single-square-inch">8. Use every single square inch</h3>



<p>This is one of the best tips for downsizing to an apartment! If you are moving from a bigger space to a smaller one, then you&#8217;ll have no choice but to utilize every single square inch. Maximize your space by doubling up the way you use it. For instance, your dresser can double as a nightstand and some stools have hidden storage compartments.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re all scared of something. For some of us, it&#8217;s the dark; for others, it&#8217;s a surprise apartment inspection. A lot can go wrong if a rental inspection by the landlord doesn&#8217;t go well. That being said, this guide will cover what an apartment inspection is, and provide you with an extensive apartment inspection checklist. These inspections can be scary but don&#8217;t worry, Roomi&#8217;s got you covered!</p>

<p>Typically, landlords, maintenance workers and property managers carry out an apartment inspection. It&#8217;s a routine check-up to make sure the apartment is in good shape and the tenant is not violating the agreements stated in the lease.</p>



<p>Apartment complex inspections can take place at different intervals, depending on the terms of your lease. On your lease, look for a clause entitled &#8220;Right to Entry&#8221;. This will tell you about how your landlord performs inspections.</p>



<p>Though landlords are legally allowed to inspect the property, they aren&#8217;t supposed to barge in without prior notice. Usually, they need to give a 24-48 hour notice, but this may vary depending on the lease terms or state laws. The landlord may also inform you that the inspection can take place whether you are home or not.</p>



<p>Typically, a landlord is not supposed to conduct &#8220;redundant and excessive inspections&#8221; . They may be violating the &#8216;Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment&#8217; clause on your lease which states that you are entitled to have your property undisturbed.</p>

<p>Most times, landlord property inspections aim to fish out any traces of lease violations. Landlords will check the features of both the exterior and interior of the apartment.</p>



<p>Tenants should point out any issue they may have about the apartment during inspections.</p>



<p>Apartment inspections can be nerve-racking, but if you prepare well beforehand, then everything will go smoothly. Here&#8217;s an apartment inspection checklist to guide you in the process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-exterior">1. Exterior</h3>



<p>Before checking the inside, the landlord will examine the state of the exterior part of the property. These may include doors, windows, garages, balconies, porches, locks, gutters, and roofs. Make sure to check:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The windows aren&#8217;t cracked or broken</li>



<li>The house doors close and lock</li>



<li>The gutters are clean</li>



<li>The garage doors are functioning well</li>



<li>The roof hasn&#8217;t been damaged by bad weather</li>



<li>The railings on the balconies are still strong</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-floors">2. Floors</h3>



<p>Having dirty floors and carpets will not work in your favor. Landlord: 1, You: 0. Be sure to take care of your floors by sweeping, mopping, and getting rid of carpet stains.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-electricity">3. Electricity</h3>



<p>Make sure that you take care of electrical objects in the home all year round. Electric issues won&#8217;t put you in your landlord&#8217;s good books during a rental inspection.</p>



<p>This is why it&#8217;s important to report things as soon as they break. Clean the HVAC and other appliances regularly to get rid of dust.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-appliances">4. Appliances</h3>



<p>Take good care of your appliances, especially the ones that were provided by the landlord. Keep your fridges, stove, microwave, and other appliances clean, and as usual, report any breakdowns.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-bathrooms">5. Bathrooms</h3>



<p>A thorough cleaning of your bathroom will help a great deal for an apartment complex inspection. None of us enjoy cleaning the bathroom, but it&#8217;s a sure-fire sign of a home that&#8217;s looked after.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-walls-and-ceilings">6. Walls and Ceilings</h3>



<p>Did you cover up some holes in the walls with picture frames? This doesn&#8217;t look great &#8211; especially if you eventually decide to move out.</p>



<p>Make an effort to patch up all the holes on your walls. Clean your ceilings by dusting them with brooms to get rid of dust, cobwebs, and debris.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-pets-damage-illegal-pets">7. Pets Damage/ Illegal Pets</h3>



<p>Before bringing your furry friends to live in your apartment, make sure the lease permits you to. It won&#8217;t be a good look for you if your landlord finds out you snuck a pet into the building.</p>



<p>However, if your lease does allow pets, then make sure to clean up any mess they may have made before the inspection.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-illegal-co-tenants">8. Illegal Co-tenants</h3>



<p>Another important part of this apartment inspection checklist is illegal co-tenants. Your landlord will not appreciate you violating the terms of your lease by allowing people to live in your apartment with you. You may have gotten away with it for some time, but it could cost you in the long run.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-furniture">9. Furniture</h3>



<p>If your apartment was furnished before you moved in, then you need to ensure that you keep everything in good shape. Examine the furniture in your apartment to make sure nothing is damaged or missing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-smoke-detector">10. Smoke Detector</h3>



<p>Every apartment should have a fully functional smoke detector, and you should check if the batteries need to be changed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-kitchen">11. Kitchen</h3>



<p>Let your kitchen be a shining example of hygiene during rental inspections. Make sure to clean all surfaces, and ensure that all kitchen appliances like the oven, stove, refrigerator and dishwashers are working well.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. It&#8217;s important that you leave no stone unturned while preparing for an inspection. We also recommend you conduct regular and thorough apartment cleanings so that a surprise inspection will not catch you off guard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There&#8217;s something magical about the fall, and Thanksgiving just adds to that warm and fuzzy feeling. Being able to share it with family and friends really is the icing on the cake. Unfortunately, people who live in small shared spaces often find that they&#8217;re constrained by space. They assume they couldn&#8217;t possibly hold Thanksgiving in a small apartment and so miss out on the opportunity to celebrate with people they love.</p>



<p>Contrary to popular assumption, living in a shared space doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t hold an ‘awemazing’ Thanksgiving dinner. There’s no need to panic. Instead, see hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment as a creative challenge that you CAN overcome! Here are a few tips and tricks on exactly what you need to transform your apartment into Shangri La and enjoy the magic of Thanksgiving with roommates, friends and family.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-plan-in-advance">1. Plan in advance</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/YoVxNJg9D6ejbbSCZ8" title="make a plan"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Ask yourself the hard questions when you start planning. How much space do I have? Do I have enough tables, chairs, cooking utensils? Would I need to get more? What are my alternatives for the things I don’t have? What can I ask others to bring along? As you answer these questions, a clearer picture of what you can and can&#8217;t do will begin to emerge. It&#8217;s an important first step if you&#8217;re going to successfully host Thanksgiving in a small apartment, so grab a pen and take your time with it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-talk-to-your-roommate-s">2. Talk to your roommate(s)</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/F6CnoyW0upKE0" title="talk"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If you share an apartment with a roommate, then talking to them is one of the first things to do when hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment. Sure, you may all have equal rights to shared spaces but the courtesy of telling your roommate guarantees you a helping hand, and prevents unnecessary arguments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-prepare-a-guest-list">3. Prepare a guest list</h2>

<p>So, you&#8217;ve identified the number of people your apartment can hold. It&#8217;s time to invite those people and confirm if they&#8217;ll be showing up. You should also let them know there’ll be no room for plus ones. This tip helps you avoid surprises in the form of Tinder dates or great aunts when hosting Thanksgiving in your small apartment!</p>



<p>Based on who&#8217;s coming, you can now make decisions about Thanksgiving seating ideas. You may want to set a designated seat at the table for every guest. You may have people coming who don&#8217;t mind eating while sitting on the couch. The confirmed guest list helps you come up with some good Thanksgiving seating ideas.</p>

<p>A chilly season means you have to prepare for your guests&#8217; coats, hats and umbrellas. These can quickly clutter your small space. Designate somewhere in your apartment for people to drop their things. It could be a rolling garment rack you place in the hallway or some space in your closet, or in the worst case, your bed. It may not be the prettiest but it&#8217;ll declutter your living room and dining space and help you better enjoy Thanksgiving with your roommates.</p>

<p>People need tables to eat their Thanksgiving dinner &#8211; right? Chances are that you don&#8217;t have enough. So, you may want to borrow some folding tables to make up for it. Even if the tables don’t match after assembling them, you can get a Thanksgiving tablecloth to hide the mismatch and create some ambiance.</p>

<p>Your kitchen is about to explode with the not-so-nice smell of used dishes, which is why it&#8217;s best to wash as you go along. Consider organizing your dishes into courses so that the period in between courses can be used to quickly wash, dry, and put aside any dishes not in use. That&#8217;ll keep dishes away from valuable serving space. Just make sure you don&#8217;t spend the entire evening in the kitchen. You&#8217;re there to spend time with your loved ones, too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-invest-in-disposable-dishware">7. Invest in disposable dishware</h2>

<p>Alternatively, you could choose to buy disposable dishware when hosting Thanksgiving in your small apartment. You likely don’t have enough space to take all the dishes you’ll need when hosting Thanksgiving in a small kitchen. Likewise, you can’t afford to leave them in your dining area or kitchen once the meal is done.</p>



<p>There is high-end disposable dishware that looks and feels like real china available. Consider getting some so you can easily throw them away as people finish their meals. Done and dusted.</p>

<p>You may need to move furniture, clutter, book stacks, or gadgets to create more space. Sometimes moving them to the wall will do. At other times, you may need to move some furniture to the bedroom temporarily.</p>



<p>Likewise, opening up the room with good lighting creates a sense of a larger space. Avoid cluttering the tables with decorative pieces. Instead, consider decorating the walls when hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment. You can also use candles arranged around the room for a warm glow.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be rigid with what you cook for Thanksgiving. It&#8217;s best to consider the space you have and make decisions based on that. For example, a turkey in the oven will force you to keep every other thing out leaving you with little room to cook anything else with the oven. Consider changing up your Thanksgiving dinner menu to use the space you do have in your kitchen.</p>



<p>Additionally, you can let your guests know what you&#8217;re cooking and turn Thanksgiving into a potluck, asking them to bring specific food items as they come. It’s also good to have a plan for dealing with leftovers when hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment.</p>

<p>An exit plan for when everyone is done eating is always nice when hosting Thanksgiving in a small space. It could be that everyone moves outside the house to the balcony, an open space nearby or a local bar for some drinks. Whatever the case, make sure you have a plan in place. It usually is the perfect way to end an amazing Thanksgiving dinner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Thanksgiving is about the conversations, the meals, the laughter, and the gift of friends and family to celebrate with. As long as that is guaranteed, most people don&#8217;t care that they&#8217;re in a small space. So sit back, relax and enjoy your Thanksgiving with roommates and those around you.</p>

<p>Cycling may be your eco-friendly choice for transportation, but storing them can be quite challenging. Not sure how you can store a bike in an apartment? Here’s what you need to know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Can You Store a Bike in an Apartment?</h2>



<p>Apart from being an eco-friendly way to get around the city, cycling every day can help you get some fresh air and is a <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits#:~:text=Regular%20cycling%20stimulates%20and%20improves,and%20reduces%20blood%20fat%20levels.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">good way to exercise</a>. However, storing your bike can be difficult, especially if you live in a small apartment. Storing your bike outside is not an ideal solution, even if your building has dedicated areas for bicycles. Keeping your bicycle outside exposes it to weather elements that reduce the longevity of your precious ride.</p>



<p>So, what can you do when you have a small apartment and like to cycle regularly? Well, you have to get creative with how you store your bike in your apartment. From buying bike racks for small apartments, to hanging your bike on your wall, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/iFFas72-dTY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remember Me</a> style, there’s a lot you can do with them! We’ve curated a list of creative, yet practical ways you can store a bike in an apartment to help you get started.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Classic Option: Hang it on the Wall</h2>



<p>The easiest way to store your bicycle in a small apartment without sacrificing your storage or floor place is to hang it on the wall. To mount your bike on a wall you can use simple hooks, or those that are designed for heavier bikes.</p>



<p>Some bike racks are designed for small apartments and allow you to hang up your bike to get it off the floor. Such bike racks help you hang your bike vertically, making it look unique and artistic, rather than a nifty way to save some space.</p>



<p>Mounting the bike on your wall can give your apartment a rustic feel, or you can hang coordinated paintings around it to make it feel like a part of the décor!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Use Your Storage</h2>



<p>If you do not mind sacrificing some storage space, then keeping your bicycle stashed away in your storage cupboard will do the trick. Storing your bicycle away in your storage cupboard frees up your space, without ruining the aesthetics of your apartment. If you’re planning on ditching your cycle <a href="https://www.welovecycling.com/wide/2019/11/01/how-to-store-the-bike-away-for-the-winter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the season</a>, this is the ideal way to store your cycle for the upcoming months.</p>



<p>Tuck your bike behind your coat to ensure that it is well out of sight. Placing it flush along the wall of your cupboard ensures it does not take up too much space. There is no special equipment needed for this method, and it is usually fairly easy to take your bike out when you think it is time to ride it again.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hiding in Plain Sight: Make it a Part of Your Décor!</h2>



<p>Apart from using bike wall mounts, you can also include your bike in any room as a part of the décor. For this, you can either add bike racks which can hold multiple bikes, or simply arrange it in any space to make it look more filled out. Coordinate the colors in the room to match your bike and make it seem cohesive. Now, no one will be able to tell that it wasn’t meant to be there in the first place!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Peek-a-boo: Tuck it Behind Furniture</h2>



<p>Have a long sofa or a couch that takes up a lot of space? Well, if it is big enough you can simply tuck your bike behind the furniture to store it there. It is a simple and convenient way to store a bike in an apartment at no extra cost. If you don’t think bike racks for your small apartment are worth the investment, hiding it behind furniture may be the best choice for you. Your guests wouldn’t spot it, and you won’t have to worry about arranging extra space for your bike.</p>



<p>If your apartment has a laundry room, you can also tuck your bike between your washer and dryer to keep it out of the way. This is an age old, tried and tested method, that is inexpensive but effective.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Bike Under the Stairs: Create a Nook for It</h2>



<p>If you love to bike and do it frequently enough, you will have some equipment to go along with it as well. Why not opt for a bike dock in your apartment? Bike docks are user-friendly and easy to install below your stairs. With these docks, you can create a nook for your bike and store your gear neatly in one place. For those who have <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cycling-accessories/">a lot of biking equipment</a> which cannot be hidden away easily, getting a dock is a great choice. If you are renting your apartment, ensure that you check in with your landlord, or your lease to ensure that you can store your bike below your stairs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Outside Your Home: Store It in Your Balcony or Porch</h2>



<p>If you have a balcony or a porch, you can easily store your bike there. Although you may need to check with your landlord if you’re renting; keeping your bike right outside your home ensures that it is safe and out of the way. It is easy to take your bike in and out when it is in your balcony, and ensures that you do not have to sacrifice any storage space!</p>

<p>Finding your dream home is no joke. Believe us, we know. Renting an apartment that fits all your needs also seems like one of those desires that only come true with an &#8220;almost&#8221; as a prefix. But the worst part? realizing that the place that looked so good in the online listing is not so great in real life can be discouraging. That’s why it is important to set realistic goals. Some of the most common questions that arise when people are trying to find the right apartment for them to rent, especially in cities like <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York</a></strong>, <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miami</a></strong>, <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-austin-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Austin</a></strong>, are questions pertaining to the smaller details. Perhaps you’ve even stumbled on countless occasions upon the term “kitchenette”. Sounds cute, right? What is a kitchenette? What is the difference between a kitchen and a kitchenette? When considering kitchen vs. kitchenette, which one is the best choice for you?</p>



<p>Well, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kitchen-vs-kitchenette-what-really-is-the-difference-between-a-kitchen-and-a-kitchenette">Kitchen vs. kitchenette: What really is the difference between a kitchen and a kitchenette?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/98095330-6eed-432b-814c-b79c9f9b67c2/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="the difference between a kitchen and a kitchenette can be the size, as displayed in this picture"/></figure>



<p>So most people will have you believe that the only difference between a kitchen and a kitchenette is size. However, there are certain other characteristics that can help you decide the best option for you.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever come across an apartment that comes with a compact kitchen or combination kitchen, you&#8217;ve run into what one might call a kitchenette. A kitchen, on the other hand, is a room fully equipped with all the cooking facilities necessary. It’s where you prep and cook everything.</p>



<p>But turns out, size isn&#8217;t the only thing that helps us differentiate when considering a kitchen vs. kitchenette.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kitchen-vs-kitchenette-the-difference-in-the-room-for-customization">Kitchen vs. kitchenette: The difference in the room for customization.</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s an age-old practice to make houses that reflect the personality of the person who owns the house. You get to outfit it with all the features you like and you get to choose any style you prefer. Since the kitchen can vary in size, you get to customize it in whatever way you want.</p>



<p>In the case of a kitchenette, on the other hand, there’s not a lot of room for creativity and flexibility. There’s very little space to work with so the design usually has to be as practical as it can be. And as for the style, it just becomes a secondary priority.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-s-a-difference-in-the-organization">There&#8217;s a difference in the organization!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bfeb82ff-98ff-488c-ad40-65a9d6b190db/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="kitchen vs kitchenette can be determined though many varying factors like size, appliances and organizational space"/></figure>



<p>When comparing the difference between a kitchen and a kitchenette, you must also consider that a kitchen comes with better scope for organization, just because of the extra space that&#8217;s available. Kitchens can include a pantry and lots of storage space in general in the form of cabinets, shelves, etc.</p>



<p>A kitchenette, on the other hand, will be the perfect option for you if you&#8217;re a minimalist, enjoy having a small functional space, and need no more than practicality. This is also the reason why you&#8217;d see a bunch of basements and pool houses that come with kitchenettes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kitchen-vs-kitchenette-the-differences-in-appliances">Kitchen vs. kitchenette: The differences in appliances!</h3>



<p>With kitchenettes, you&#8217;ll have limited space to work with. This also means that you&#8217;ll have to stop yourself from going overboard with filling your kitchenette with appliances.</p>



<p>Full-size appliances are almost never a part of a kitchenette’s design. Usually, they include a microwave, a small fridge and freezer, and a hot plate. It’s enough to prepare a few quick and simple dishes, but if you want to impress with your cooking skills, this is not the place to do it. That said, if you’re looking for healthy and space-saving appliance options, a compact and <a href="https://www.hurom.com/products/h-aa-slow-juicer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quiet juicer</a> can be a smart addition—ideal for morning juice without disturbing roommates.</p>



<p>A standard kitchen, on the other hand, is almost always equipped with a stovetop, a sink, a dishwasher, microwave, refrigerator, and several other electric appliances. Even small kitchens get to include all these things. Built-in appliances are a great way to save space.</p>
