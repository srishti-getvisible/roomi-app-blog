<p>The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic left us all shook and reconsidering our life choices. However, today most of us are seizing the day and changing our life statuses to YOLO! With most travel restrictions lifted and the new COVID vaccine in town, the airports are thronged with eager travelers. So if you&#8217;re that young professional, college grad, or student who put their travel plans on hold, this perhaps is your chance to push the resume button. Also, traveling and exploring the world doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive always. Not if you know how to cut corners and set a low travel budget for your next trip.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to travel the world on a budget?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re new to the solo travel &amp; wanderlust community, starting slow will be a great starting point for you. Instead, of deep-diving and exploring expensive continents like North America, Europe &amp; Africa. Start with continents that have a cheaper cost of living. Like Southeast Asia &amp; Central America. This is not meant to discourage, rather a great exercise to help you spend less while traveling. There&#8217;s a general formula that applies to all low-budget travels. Below are some great tips that can help reduce your expenses while budgeting for your next travel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips to cut expenses from your travel budget</h2>



<p>Flights, food, accommodation, and commute hold the major chunk of your travel expenses. Cutting down on these essential expenses will help you achieve your low-budget travel target. Moreover, this budgeting style will let you enjoy more travel destinations and trips. Here&#8217;s how it works!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Get Cheap Flights</h3>

<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong><span style="color:#e22658" class="has-inline-color">Roomi Tip For Budget Travelers</span>:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Always</em>&nbsp;use the incognito mode when looking for cheap flights. And avoid booking tickets for weekends as they tend to be more expensive.</pre>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Frequent Flyer program(FFP)</h3>

<p>Consider this program as a way of thank you from the aviation industry. If you&#8217;re a&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.usnews.com/rankings/travel-rewards/airline-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">frequent flyer</a>, travel enthusiast, a digital nomad, a content creator &#8211; you NEED this!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Save money on food &amp; drinks<br></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

<p>Planning a long-term trip on a strict travel budget? Then, you must avoid eating and drinking at fancy restaurants every day. Carve out a daily low-budget travel plan out of your total budget. Having a daily limit will prevent you from overspending and exhausting your money. Some cost-effective options include:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">?<strong>Fresh Produce</strong></h4>



<p>Choose from the country&#8217;s fresh produce &amp; dairy. Enjoy it while soaking in the scenic beauty of the place you&#8217;re visiting. Many countries allow travelers and citizens to drink in parks or on the beach. So pick a local six-pack and enjoy it in the open!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">?<strong>Cook your meals</strong></h4>



<p>Many accommodations offer a common kitchen for guests to prepare their meals.TBH, this is a more cost-effective option in our opinion than eating out.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">?<strong>Street food</strong></h4>



<p>Indulge in the local street food when cooking seems like a cumbersome task. Every place has a unique cuisine which is evident in their street food &#8211; so make sure to not miss that experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Save money on accommodation</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

	</div>
	


<p><strong><em>Budget-friendly accommodations &gt; luxurious resorts</em></strong><br>Waking up to stunning views is the opening chapter of every travel vlogger&#8217;s book. However, as a budget-traveler, you need to choose places that will help you save money. Why? Because you will be spending the majority of your day exploring the city. And will only return to your accommodation for rest at night. Some cost-effective options include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/">Hostel World</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/">Couchsurfing</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.airbnb.co.in/c/rebeccas12260?currency=USD&amp;locale=en&amp;_set_bev_on_new_domain=1615052393_ODAzNDgzNzY5MTA5">Airbnb</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trustedhousesitters.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA7YyCBhD_ARIsALkj54owUigggPBmrNxJnG1nMxoDlNoFe6_Tz9g5Q1oexQ7M6f734-ez9qgaAt-QEALw_wcB">Trusted Housesitters</a>. Some volunteering/daily work opportunities can also help you stay for free in these locations. How awesome is that?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Travel in the offseason</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/jVc9WmM1N8QwlK3sVy" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/jVc9WmM1N8QwlK3sVy/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>The off-season is frankly the best time to take a trip to otherwise expensive cities. Not only will you find cheaper flights but also cheap accommodation which is otherwise quite expensive. This is a helpful tip for all of those looking to create a bullet-proof travel budget.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Shop less</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:41%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/uBfr9DFs9vc40" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/uBfr9DFs9vc40/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Stay clear of splurging on clothes, jewelry &amp; souvenirs. Instead, take photos and make memories that you can later frame and give as presents to your friends &amp; loved ones.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Walk more or take the public transport</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/XGgWYQy8T5dpolTg2Q" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/XGgWYQy8T5dpolTg2Q/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Taxis can be quite expensive and capable of disrupting your travel budget. So make the best of public transport like buses, subway, and trains to get to different locations within your destination. It&#8217;s both a Budget &amp; Eco-friendly option.</p>

<p>And when it comes to cutting corners, the easiest place to start is your groceries. This doesn&#8217;t just help you inculcate habits of spending less but also helps you save more money.</p>



<p>That being said, people&#8217;s reasons for wanting to split bills can run beyond wanting to save money. Ever so often, conflicts arise and bills are some of the toughest topics to argue over.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-fix-your-relationships-with-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Even when roommate conflicts are pretty much inevitable</a>, eliminating them is our favorite thing to do. Setting systems that reduce conflicts is the best thing you can do when managing monthly expenses with roommates.</p>



<p>Here are some things that you can do if you&#8217;re looking to split your bills wisely, budget better, or set boundaries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communicate your need to budget better.</h2>



<p>Communication needs to be the central aspect of any relationship. And talking about money is also an important aspect of your relationship with your roommates. It may seem like an uncomfortable topic at first, but getting it on the table is required for a healthy relationship.</p>



<p>Have a house-meeting with your roommates and talk about your household expenses. This is one of the first steps in creating a better budget.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">List out all your expenses.</h3>



<p>Go through all the expenses you will be collectively enduring and write it down in the form of a document. This will also come in handy if you&#8217;re faced with confessions later on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fix your household costs.</h3>



<p>This is how you will be creating a better budget. You can take this opportunity to make notes, and divide who pays for what. Or who pays <em>how much</em> for every item.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Discuss your rent.</h3>



<p>Is there a difference in the sizes of your rooms, or the way space is divided in your apartment? Here&#8217;s where you adjust your budgets accordingly.</p>



<p>Some people like to divide the costs equally, no matter the difference in housing. Others prefer dividing it based on who uses what. We don’t think there’s a right or wrong way to do this, but a transparent discussion will ensure everyone is comfortable.</p>



<p>Your ultimate goal should be to create a monthly budget for your household that is inclusive of most of everyone&#8217;s needs. Yep, <em>most of everyone&#8217;s needs</em>, because all would be too idealistic. Unless of course you&#8217;re able to accomplish that. In which case, hurray! You&#8217;re already budgeting better than most of us!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">List your respective budgets.</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re splitting groceries, you must communicate each person&#8217;s bills accordingly. A vegan roommate would probably be uncomfortable paying for their roommate&#8217;s meat consumption.</p>



<p>Additionally, some people might have their monthly expenses for groceries capped at $100, while others might not be comfortable shelling out more than $40 dollars.</p>



<p>Talking about how you will be dividing groceries is an important aspect of budgeting better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create a system that suits all your roommates&#8217; budgets.</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s technological support for everything today. Based on the way we&#8217;ve tried and tested, two methods stand out the best.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Create a spreadsheet to help you budget better.</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re a bunch of people that anticipate changes in your living, this is the way to go. Creating spreadsheets is a flexible way of budgeting groceries better. A spreadsheet is completely customisable and can be tailored based on your exact needs.</p>



<p>This needs to be a team effort, and will require patience. Especially when you are importing Excel formulas to automate your monthly expenses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use a budgeting app.</h3>



<p>This is the best way out for roommates who do not appreciate sitting down together every month to do the math. Automating calculations is also an easy way to save time. There are several apps available today that can help you budget better. Some of our top recommendations include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.splitwise.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">SplitWise</a> — super easy interface, one of the best options in the market currently.</li><li><a href="http://www.spendee.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spendee</a> — Syncs with online banking options and allows for easy finance management for families or groups living together.</li><li><a href="http://billr.me/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billr Me</a> — Great app for people spending on an outing. The app will also add in taxes and tips. A copy of the split bill can be sent to the rest of the group members.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Out and about shopping for groceries with your roommates? Here are <em><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/8-secrets-to-spending-less-while-grocery-shopping-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Secrets To Spending Less While Grocery Shopping</a>!</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Discuss payment schedules</h2>



<p>The last straw in creating a better budget for you and your roommates is to discuss when all payments will be made. You will have to take into consideration the date mentioned on your lease for rent payment. As well as the date everybody gets paid from work.</p>



<p>Finding a middle ground between the two is the sweet spot you should be aiming for. The whole process in general will also require active inputs from every individual along the way.</p>

And people without there&#8217;s a plethora of excuses for not having a personal budget. But what we wonder is, why do people want to deny themselves financial freedom? Because that&#8217;s exactly what excuses for not having a personal budget do. They deny you financial freedom.</p>



<p>If we don’t budget, how will we know the areas where we are overspending, and how do we keep our finances in check? <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-develop-steady-habits-and-how-you-can-use-them-to-succeed/1399/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simply put: you can’t.</a>&nbsp;There are many excuses for not having a personal budget, and some of the most common ones are listed below!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This one cracks me up: Budgeting is too scary</h2>

<p>Budgeting is not frightening, but it might shock you to know how your money is doing (or not doing!). Your spend analysis might prove that you help support businesses like Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Gucci, Chanel, Costco, Macy’s, and other designers from around the world. Try calling it ‘Cash Flow Plan’ for a change.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The best excuse for not having a personal budget: &#8220;I am not good with numbers!&#8221;</h2>

<p>Budgeting requires just fifth-grade math. Even so, this is the most common excuse you&#8217;ll hear! Having a personal budget requires minimal skills when it comes to numbers, and if you can solve 5–1=4, then you can budget your finances just fine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ignorance at its peak: &#8220;I am busy and don&#8217;t have the time to do a budget!&#8221;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>It may take a couple of hours the first time you create your budgeting plan because you may be required to go through your bank statements, past bills, outgoings, etc. The worst-case scenario is that you might have to spend 2 hours the first month. The following month, it will take half the time. The third month takes even less. Once you begin, you&#8217;ll find that it takes no more than 20 minutes to create a personal budget for the month.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;My friends and family will think I am crazy&#8221;</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>If your friends and family are making fun of you for being cautious about spending, you&#8217;re probably making a personal budget and sticking to it (that means not giving in to take-out every time they want it.) <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-ways-to-think-about-your-future-career-plan/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eventually, they will see you are debt-free and have extra money!</a> Freedom from debt is greater than mindless spending.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;I will start having a personal budget after I get ___.&#8221;</h2>

<p>The blanks are mere excuses to delay the inevitable &#8211; something that you are never really going to follow through with. When you say, &#8220;I am going to start training for a marathon after ________,&#8221; it requires thoughtful action to fill in the blanks. If true financial freedom is what you&#8217;re planning, go ahead and grab a pen and fill in the blank: &#8220;I will start budgeting <em>Right Now</em>.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The one that always fails &#8220;I already budget in my head and keep track of everything&#8221;</h2>

<p>Personal budgets get over, but excuses for not having a personal budget do not. </p>



<p>Utilities, cable, credit card payment, life insurance, mortgage, groceries, gas, gym membership, dining out, savings, auto insurance, student loans, birthday gifts, investing, mobile phone payments, hair and makeup, rent, coffee &amp; shopping. If you have an eidetic memory like Sheldon Cooper, then have it at. But if you&#8217;re anything like us, enjoying financial freedom will require you to make an excel sheet or use a budgeting app. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any money left to budget&#8221;</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>You don&#8217;t have money left to plan a budget because you aren&#8217;t budgeting. If there is even some money coming in, then you require a cash flow plan. Budgeting is merely telling your income where to go instead of wondering where it all went each month.&nbsp;Budgeting concepts are simple, and the equation is:</p>



<p>Budgeting = Having money</p>



<p>Not budgeting = Not having money</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;I cannot budget because I have an irregular income&#8221;</h2>

<p>Honestly, it is slightly more challenging to budget on irregular income than fixed ones. But even when you have inconsistent income, you can still create a cash flow plan.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Grocery shopping bills are a necessary expense that takes up a major chunk of our earnings. With the quarantine on our hands, most of us spend our time devouring 6-7 meals per day to beat boredom. When we go grocery shopping, we can&#8217;t help but fall prey to consumerism and end up spending wayyy more than we planned! Roomi shares every good grocery secret out there.</p>



<p>If cutting down your grocery shopping bills is on your mind, here are some secret tips that have been proven to work, if followed diligently. You&#8217;re welcome!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-1-make-a-meal-plan-before-grocery-shopping">Secret #1: Make a meal plan before grocery shopping</h2>



<p>This simple yet effective tip not only saves you time but tons of money. Imagine going grocery shopping with no dish in mind and deciding your weekly needs while standing in front of the veggie stand <em>(aargh, been there done that)</em>. Be smart, and get ahead of yourself &#8211; make a weekly meal plan and stick to it. Make use of what you already have in your pantry when creating your meal plan to avoid food waste</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-2-make-a-monthly-budget-for-your-grocery-shopping">Secret #2: Make a monthly budget for your grocery shopping</h2>



<p>This may be a little tough for most of you initially, but it will be super rewarding once you reach the end of the month and realize that you stuck to your budget! The trick is to give yourself a reasonable figure like &#8211;&nbsp;<em>&#8220;I will only spend 30dollars a week on groceries.&#8221;</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>&#8220;I have reserved 100 dollars for grocery this month.&#8221;&nbsp;</em>Roll with this idea like a way of challenging yourself to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-easy-tricks-to-spend-less-save-more-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">spend less and save more.</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-3-no-grocery-shopping-on-an-empty-stomach">Secret #3: No grocery shopping on an empty stomach!</h2>



<p>Ahh, this is a rookie mistake &#8211; NEVER go grocery shopping when you&#8217;re hungry, as you will end up buying much more than you need <em>(everything looks super yum when you&#8217;re hungry)</em>. Eat a light snack or a meal before you go grocery shopping.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-4-write-a-grocery-shopping-list">Secret #4: Write a grocery shopping list</h2>



<p>This is no secret sauce; our mothers, fathers, and grandparents have been doing this for decades now, and for good reasons. While you&#8217;re preparing your weekly meal plans, add the items you need before you go grocery shopping. This will let you stay within your budget and not lose focus with all the yummies around you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-5-make-the-most-of-leftovers">Secret #5: Make the most of leftovers</h2>



<p><em>In the United States,&nbsp;<strong>food waste</strong>&nbsp;is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the&nbsp;<strong>food</strong>&nbsp;supply.</em></p>



<p>A part of this food wastage is partly down to American households not planing their meals properly and tossing the leftovers. One can always use leftovers by reheating or turning it into another fantastic dish. Have leftover pasta? Add it to a bowl of soup! Leftover chicken? Add it to a salad! The opportunity to create something new is endless, just be a little creative.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-6-buy-what-s-on-sale">Secret #6: Buy what&#8217;s on sale</h2>



<p>Do you ever check grocery shopping sale ads online? If you don&#8217;t, now is the right time to start! Say, for example, if you spotted chicken on sale, try and come up with different recipes that you can make throughout the week with this main ingredient. This can apply to almost all ingredients! </p>



<p>If you see a bunch of ingredients on sale, plan your weekly meals accordingly. It will help you stay within your budget and keep you feelin&#8217; creative! The&nbsp;<a href="https://flipp.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flipp app</a>&nbsp;can help you see the items on sale in your zip code. Works great to keep those grocery shopping bills under check!</p>

If you&#8217;re amongst a few who&#8217;re looking to &#8216;go vegetarian,&#8217; then this is a good place to start your plant-based journey.</p>

<p>Saving for a vacation, a laptop, to pay off your student loans? Whatever you may be saving money for, setting up visual reminders in places you look the most will help you stay focused and save more.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re planning a vacation to see the northern lights, put up a photo/visual reminder of it in your bedroom, workstation, and even your bathroom. All these photos will remind you of your purpose.</p>



<p>Basically, if you love online shopping and can&#8217;t help it &#8211; try changing your phone and desktop background to a photo/creative that represents a fat zero or an empty wallet. This little activity will take the excitement out of your usual online haul.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Saving money the elite way: follow the 48-hour rule</h2>



<p>So you saw this really cool thing online, and you can&#8217;t wait to move the item from your virtual cart to your home. Give the item 48 hours before you buy it. You will only buy something that you really need, which makes your day-to-day tasks more manageable. Impulse buys = temporary happiness. Studies show that the joy of impulse buy is momentary, and an individual feels more stressed to have not saved that money. One of the best ways to cut expenses and save money is to give any buy 48 hours of consideration &#8211; if you really need it, you will be back to purchase it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our best money saving tip: Use cash instead of cards</h2>

<p>This trick is relatively simple but highly effective. If you have a specific weekly spending amount, encash it and use it for all your week&#8217;s purchases. This way, you will be able to track your expenditure and keep tabs on how much is left. Moreover, cards have a way of making us feel less guilty about our purchases and expenses. With cash, the parting pain is much greater compared to plastic tapping and swiping.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Explore cheaper plans</h2>



<p>Our phone and television plans can sum up to be quite hefty. Revaluate your needs based on your consumption. Choose the subscriptions that fit your lifestyle. You can alternatively <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/keep-track-expenses-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">decide to split television or online app plans with your roomis</a> to make it more sustainable. Remember, there are always cheaper plans and subscriptions available in the market which can help you save a lot of money.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bargain!! </h2>

<p>This is by far, the easiest of all the money saving tips that exist. Thrift shopping is like treasure hunting; one won&#8217;t know what they might find. These places say that they have fixed prices, but you can always talk sweetly in conversation. And with bulk buying, and you could bargain for a better price. There&#8217;s no harm in trying &#8211; imagine getting a great deal on that almost new television set or a gorgeous furniture piece.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Put your savings in the bank</h2>



<p>If you can&#8217;t control your spendings &#8211; give it to someone more responsible like the bank. Your bank can help you maintain a savings account, which you will find easier to manage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Watch and reward yourself as you keep learning new money saving tips!</h2>

<p>As it feels as though COVID-19 has put some things on hold, you may be looking for money-saving ideas for early retirement, world travel, or just an emergency fund. But come some free time paired with the luxury of E-commerce, we just can&#8217;t help flushing our money down the online shopping drain.</p>



<p>Now, with quarantine confining us to our comfortable four walls, we have the opportunity to put all those money-saving ideas to use.</p>



<p>‘It’s not that simple,’ you say? Maybe it is if you simply give it a try! Here are some easy money-saving tips for you to take that first step towards saving.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how can I save money in the times of Covid-19?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Do some basic mathematics to cut corners &amp; increase savings! </h3>



<p>For all of you wondering &#8211; &#8220;ugh, I am a spendthrift, how will I ever save money?&#8221; Fret not! Firstly, start calculating your income &amp; expenditures by asking yourself these questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>What&#8217;s my income? </li><li>How much do I need to set aside monthly for rent, food, and other necessities? </li><li>What&#8217;s my remaining balance? <br>Secondly, ask yourself how much are you willing to set aside as <em>savings.</em> Don’t be stingy. This money is for you too &#8211; the future you! Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic is literally the perfect opportunity to maximize savings. </li></ul>

<p>You know how you order in and then feel two kinds of heartburn? One from indigestion, and the other one from spending unnecessarily? Put an end to your sufferings and order in, only every now and again, to reward yourself. Don’t make working from home an excuse by telling yourself you don’t have time to cook, while you watch TV. Buy groceries with your money instead and get better at cooking to stay healthy while maximizing savings in the process. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Save money for substantial things &gt; Online shopping </h3>



<p>You’re tired after a long day, you go online and see something that really catches your eye. You decide to treat yourself for all the hard work you’ve put in. While you might get some happiness out of it, you realize it&#8217;s generally short-lived. On the other hand, if you save that money instead, you will be one step closer to your savings goal.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Make a shopping list and stick to it</h3>



<p>This is one of those money-saving ideas that reflect changes in your bank account almost immediately. Because you can’t save everything for the future. There could be some useful things that you want but never thought you had enough money for. Make a list of such things. Put the approximate price against each item. Buy as and when you can. And try and stick to your list. You will be surprised at just how much money you can save </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Open a different savings account</h3>



<p>If you don’t understand investments and bonds, you could open a different bank account for your savings. No matter how small the amount, make it a habit to transfer some money as and when you can. Do not use the card or save the details of that card on your devices and keep it aside to work towards your savings goals. Use these Covid-19 times to minimize expenditure &amp; save more money!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial planning basics are not the long, drawn-out, intimidating, or complicated process that many make it out to be. Even if you&#8217;re one of those &#8220;what does finance mean?&#8221; folks, no fear. Financial planning is a straightforward practice that takes little time and reaps large money rewards. Whether you are a working professional or fresh out of college: it&#8217;s time to get serious with your finances.</p>



<p>Having a solid plan to manage your finances allows you to save money, afford the things you want, and achieve your long-term financial goals. Everyone&#8217;s financial planning looks different. If you&#8217;re wondering how to or why you need to create a plan for your finances, then read on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Financial planning basics rule #1: Spend less than you make</h2>



<p>Rent, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/easy-healthy-budget-meals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">groceries</a>, travel, chilling, beer &amp; shopping all require planning out your money and finances. It is a no-brainer that you need to spend less money than you earn. Unfortunately, financial planning is not easy when you have a lifestyle to keep up with. </p>



<p>When your finances drown on all fronts, it is easy to overspend. Here&#8217;s the first step. Track all your expenditures over a period to map out how you really spend money. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/personal-finance-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Budgeting apps</a> can help make this task much easier for you.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Financial planning basics rule #2: Make a monthly budget for your finances</h2>



<p>Identify your income sources and plan out your fixed expenses. Once you have a budget worked out, you have an easy path to your financial planning goals. Instead of <em>hoping</em> to save money, you can <em>start</em> saving right now. </p>



<p>When starting with financial planning basics, remember that every penny counts! You can begin putting funds towards your goals like saving for a vacation, an emergency fund, or a big spend. Challenge yourself and find creative ways to stick to your budget no matter what!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Don’t be afraid to adjust your budget throughout the month. In fact, embrace this practice.</em></p></blockquote></figure>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Pay off credit cards each month to effectively manage finances</h2>



<p>It is prudent to pay off credit card bills each month to avoid costly interest payments. Many people ignore the first payment and let the balance carry over to the next month. </p>



<p>You may end up paying more money in interest than on the original purchase itself. If you are unable to pay off all credit bills each month, try to make an effort to pay a little more than the minimum amount. Any payment is better than the minimum amount or no payment at all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em><a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASIC&#8217;s Money Smart</a> says, &#8220;if you make only minimum repayments to a $4,400 credit card debt, then it will take you 31 years to pay it off and cost you around $14,900 in interest.&#8221; That&#8217;s $10,500 more than the original debt!</em></p></blockquote></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Build an emergency money fund</h2>



<p>An emergency fund is an important part of financial planning basics. It is a separate savings account that is put aside for unexpected expenses. It acts as a safety net for last-minute expenses like when your car breaks down, or you lose your job, etc.</p>



<p>Since you do not know what the future holds, being prepared is the best option. With no emergency funds, you risk financial trouble as you tend to take debt (credit card) or drain on personal funds in the absence of an emergency fund. What does finance mean without an emergency fund anyway?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Open a separate high-interest savings account and set up automated payments after receiving your salary every month.</em></p></blockquote></figure>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Get yourself insured!</h2>



<p>Insurance is your indispensable layer of protection that should be your priority. It&#8217;s like a shield protecting you financially from unfortunate life events like a critical illness or accident. With no insurance, any mishap could send your life into a tailspin. Additionally, there are life, income, and mortgage/renter&#8217;s insurance, which differentiate between a small bump or a big one.</p>



<p><em>Review your insurance every three to five years, during this time your personal assets, income, liabilities would have gone through changes.</em></p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Be consistent with your finances</h2>



<p>Strategic financial planning means consistency. You may get off track here and there; try to stick to it in the long run. Small money habits can make a huge difference in your finances.</p>



<p>Takeaways:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Financial planning is not only for the wealthy, and it doesn&#8217;t have to cost a penny. No matter how much money you have, you can start with DIY financial planning that will set you up for future success.</em></p></blockquote></figure>
