<p>Let&#8217;s face it, 2020 has been a year of significant change.</p>



<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals all over the world have had to make the decision to work from home.</p>



<p>While you might enjoy the routine of working from an office, 2020 has shown us that staying home to work isn’t as bad as we thought it would be!</p>



<p>In fact, there are plenty of benefits. When you work from home, there’s no need to worry about long commutes or showing up late to meetings&#8230; plus, you can wear sweatpants all day!</p>



<p>So, how do you navigate working from home while <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-living with a roommate?</a></p>



<p>From Zoom meetings to business calls, it can be hard to stay focused and keep work private while living with another person.</p>



<p>Here are a few tips to help you work from home effectively while living with roommates!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-create-a-schedule">Create a schedule</h2>



<p>Creating structure is an absolutely crucial part of working from home efficiently when living with a roomi or roommates. Why? Because can be super easy to get distracted when sharing a space with another person! If your roommate is on a different schedule than you and spends their days watching Netflix on full volume while you’re trying to make a business call, things can get tricky.</p>



<p>In order to avoid schedule clashes with your roomi, try and map out your days during the week in terms of what time your meetings fall, or when you really need some quiet time to knuckle down. Let your roommate know when it’s okay to make noise in the kitchen and when you really need the apartment to be quiet. Creating a schedule for yourself will help you and your roommate structure your time more efficiently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-be-flexible-life-happens">Be flexible, life happens!</h2>



<p>Sometimes things don’t work out the way we want them to, and that’s okay!</p>



<p>When working from home, there are a number of distractions that can arise compared to when working from an office. We can&#8217;t always control outside factors, so we need to be able to be flexible with our schedule and structure! Maybe there’s construction going on in your apartment, or your roommate is working out in the living room? if you can&#8217;t block out the noise and focus. why not head to your local coffee shop to complete your work instead of working from your apartment that day? Try and remember that life happens and issues can come up unexpectedly, and sometimes you just have to run with it!</p>



<p>Take a deep breath and try and remain relaxed and flexible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-create-a-daily-routine">Create a daily routine</h2>



<p>Making a routine for yourself will help you feel more normal amongst these challenging times. Just because you’re working from home, it doesn’t mean that your professionalism has to go out of the window (the sweat pants can stay of course!). Make sure that you go to bed at the same time as you would normally, wake up early, and eat breakfast before you start your day. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great option to incorporate daily planner templates into your daily routine to plan your day effectively and maintain a structured schedule. Be sure to wear a professional work shirt in order to make you feel the part, and if you can, encourage your roomi to get into a work routine with you &#8211; it’ll make creating structure much easier!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-communicate-with-your-roommate">Communicate with your roommate</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/why-is-my-roommate-not-talking-to-me-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">As with any relationship, communication is key!</a> Working from home is a huge life change for everyone, and it may take some time for you and your roommate to get used to your new routine. Be sure to communicate with your roomi about what you need from them in order to work efficiently and effectively. Your job depends on it! Set aside blocks of time when you need the apartment to be quiet and decide which area in your apartment will act as your office space, even if it is a corner in your bedroom. It’s important to separate your relaxing area from your work area.</p>



<p>Let your roommate know if something isn’t working for you, and make sure that they do the same with you! After all, you’re in this together!</p>

<p>Living with roommates can be an awesome experience. A roommate can become a built-in best friend and your go-to confidant. A good roommate is a blessing, but you’re bound to experience different types of roommates with a range of different roommate personalities and habits that won’t necessarily mesh with your own.</p>



<p>Don’t fret, it’s okay to be different from your roommate and you should be prepared to live with a mixed bag of people that aren&#8217;t like you. Here are 6 different types of roommates that you’ll probably encounter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" data-attachment-id="9546" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/attachment/different-types-of-roommates/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="683,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="different types of roommates" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="girl and boy talking to each other in a beautiful white house" class="wp-image-9546" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Slobs, the most common roommate personality!</h2>



<p>This character you just can&#8217;t seem to escape, these roommates will often forget to clean up after themselves and leave their room looking like a mess. These types of roommates are especially hard to coexist with if you’re organized and need your home to be neat and tidy. </p>



<p>If you’re the opposite of this roommate personality, coliving with one might be hard to deal with. If messiness is becoming an increasing problem and your roomi is stressing you out, try having a talk with them about their cleaning habits. Communication is the basis of all good roommate relationships.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. The noisy one, this roommate type can piss you off in 0.001 seconds</h2>



<p>Early risers beware! This type of roommate tends to be a night owl and will stay up all hours of the night. The noisy one will blast music while they’re working and decide to spontaneously rearrange their room at night. Moreover, they often doesn’t realize that they are noisy and that their habits are driving everyone else insane.</p>



<p>If you enjoy peace and quiet, there will definetly be disagreements between you and your noisy roommate. As always, make sure to communicate with them and outline your boundaries. Creating a roommate agreement (that includes set quiet hours) might be a good idea in order for your roomi to have a better understanding of the house rules.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The organized one</h2>



<p>The organized roomi is a blessing! You can count on them to be respectful and to always clean up after themselves when they make a mess. Their room is always neat and they make their bed each morning. The organized roommate will most likely volunteer to do the dishes and clean the apartment. You&#8217;ve struck gold with this roomi &#8211; congrats!</p>



<p>No matter what kind of roomi you are, having an organized roommate is a good one to have. Unless they are obsessive about their cleanliness, their organization skills will definitely come in handy!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The party animal, the roommate type that just can&#8217;t help it!</h2>



<p>This roomi is a social butterfly. The party animal is always down to go to the bar on weeknights and is constantly searching for the next thrill. They often invite people over to the apartment and don&#8217;t always let you know beforehand. The party animal is an extrovert and will always make you feel welcome.</p>



<p>If you’re more of an introvert, having a party animal as a roommate may not be the best fit for you. Be sure to let them know your boundaries and ask them to be respectful of your shared living space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The one who’s MIA</h2>



<p>Most of the time, this roomi is nowhere to be seen. The MIA roommate doesn’t spend much time in the apartment and prefers to do their own thing. They spend the majority of time in their room, but they&#8217;re respectful of your space, pay their bills on time, and are content with staying in the shadows.</p>



<p>If you’re fine with your roommate doing their own thing, this may be a good personality fit for you. As long as they clean up their mess and keep their music low, you’ll get along just fine!</p>

<p><br>¿Te acabas de mudar con roomies y quieres que todo marche viento en popa?</p>



<p>A continuación te dejamos un par de reglas básicas o mandamientos, para que convivas con tus roomies de la mejor manera posible; ya sabes lo que dicen&#8230; más vale prevenir que lamentar <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>No tomarás nada sin preguntar</strong>. A nadie le gusta que tomen sus cosas sin pedir permiso; pide prestado y si accede ¡cuídalo! quisieras que la otra persona hiciera lo mismo.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.dadaroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/girl-with-brush.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="girl-with-brush" class="wp-image-2740"/></figure></div>


<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>No te comerás sus alimentos</strong>. Si llegas cansado de trabajar o estudiar y esperas ansiosamente tu último pedazo de pizza y este desapareció, odiarás a la otra persona. ¡No lo hagas!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.dadaroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/giphy1.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="giphy" class="wp-image-2742"/></figure></div>


<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>No criticarás al novio, date, etc</strong>. Estás compartiendo casa con alguien, eso no te da derecho a juzgar sus relaciones. Evita el drama y mantente al margen.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.dadaroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/buffy-excuse-me-gif.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="buffy-excuse-me-gif" class="wp-image-2744"/></figure></div>


<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>No aplicarás mensajes pasivo agresivos</strong>. Sabemos que puede ser divertido si se trata de algo amable qué decir, pero si tienes un problema afróntalo de forma madura y dilo de frente.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" height="576" width="1024" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.dadaroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3mvv0YL-1024x576.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="3mvv0YL-1024x576" class="wp-image-2745"/></figure></div>


<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>No invitarás amigos sin avisar</strong>. No hay nada peor que llegar súper cansado y encontrarte con desconocidos en tu depa.&nbsp;O bien que estés en las peores fachas y de pronto tu roomie caiga con gente ¡avisa!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.dadaroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/week-in-review-james-franco-gifs-elitedaily.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="week-in-review-james-franco-gifs-elitedaily" class="wp-image-2746"/></figure></div>


<p>6.&nbsp;<strong>No olvidarás sacar la basura</strong>. Todos generamos basura, así que túrnense para sacarla; toma 10 minutos, no olvides hacerlo y poner una bolsa nueva en su lugar.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.dadaroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tumblr_inline_npait9PKb91roai5a_500.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="tumblr_inline_npait9PKb91roai5a_500" class="wp-image-2747"/></figure></div>


<p>7.&nbsp;<strong>No escucharás música a todo volumen</strong>. Respeta el espacio en el que estás ya que es compartido, es horrible despertar el domingo con canciones a todo volumen o gritos desafinados.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.dadaroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fresh-prince-sandwich2.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="fresh-prince-sandwich2" class="wp-image-2748"/></figure></div>


<p>8.&nbsp;<strong>No tardarás horas en el baño</strong>. Si sabes que el baño es compartido ¡no lo acapares! A todos nos gusta la higiene pero si las dos personas deben salir temprano a trabajar no tardes 3 horas en la regadera.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.dadaroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GleeShower.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="GleeShower" class="wp-image-2749"/></figure></div>


<p>9.&nbsp;<strong>No dejarás sucio el baño</strong>. Va de la mano con el punto anterior, si sabes que otra persona comparte este espacio, déjalo de la misma forma que te gustaría encontrarlo. Quita la pasta de dientes del lavabo y jamás dejes cabello.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>10.&nbsp;<strong>No hagas un escándalo si tu roomie duerme</strong>. En domingo es una pésima idea ponerte a aspirar el depa a las 7 de la mañana, o si ya es muy tarde entre semana y sabes que duerme es grosero poner la tele o música con volumen muy alto ¡evita hacerlo!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Having a roommate can be an awesome experience, but sometimes we don’t always get along with our roommate &#8211; and that&#8217;s okay! Our roommate doesn’t have to be our best friend and it’s normal to get into disagreements with one another when you&#8217;re practically living on top of each other every day. If you&#8217;re having roommate problems, don’t freak out, here are a few tips that’ll help you smoothen this relationship bump.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Communicate with your roomi when something is bothering you</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/QZ0vFWrpgccsZz4tNh" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/QZ0vFWrpgccsZz4tNh/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Communication is the answer to every question! If you and your roomi have gotten into a fight, it’s important to not ignore them and instead face the issue. This is the person you’re sharing a home with, so it’s important that you don’t have any bad blood between the two of you. Immediately address the issue at hand instead of letting the anger build up inside.</p>



<p>Did your roommate do something that rubbed you the wrong way? Let them know! Finding out each other’s boundaries is crucial when creating a healthy home environment. Set limits with one another and be respectful of your roomi&#8217;s limits. This can help you keep a majority of roommate problems at bay.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Good listening skills can help you stay clear of roommate problems</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o7bucZfOGGG4gWlPy" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/much-fail-3o7bucZfOGGG4gWlPy"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Just as it’s important for you to tell your roomi when something is bothering you, it’s important that you listen to your roomi when they talk to you. Let your roomi know that you acknowledge their feelings and concerns. Even if you don’t agree with what they&#8217;re saying, make an effort to listen, and work together to come to a compromise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Talk to a friend about the problems you&#8217;ve been having your roommate</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:83%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/RiiIImVSYLD7rWrkq9" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/RiiIImVSYLD7rWrkq9/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Don’t know how to bring up an issue that&#8217;s bothering you directly to your roommate? Reach out to a close friend or family member and talk about the problems you&#8217;re having with your roommate. Talking is extremely therapeutic and it can be helpful to get another person’s perspective on a situation. Ask your friend or family member their thoughts on how to approach your roommate with the issue at hand.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Create your own space</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/9tx0gy37p7oXu" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/9tx0gy37p7oXu/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>It’s important that you have your own space when living with a roommate. Whether this space is your bedroom or at a friend’s house, find somewhere you can chill and have downtime separate from your roomi.</p>



<p>If you and your roomi don’t get along, it’s okay if you make plans for time away from them. Crash at a friend’s house or spend time at your favorite coffee shop &#8211; find a place that you enjoy in order to give yourself a break from being at home and help to maintain a positive outlook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Clean up after yourself and respect your roomi</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/9PtfS5tTC8ejlYfCLU" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/9PtfS5tTC8ejlYfCLU/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Relationships are a two-way street, so make sure you’re being a good roommate as well. Whenever you’re done cooking, be sure to take care of the dishes and put away any food that you’ve taken out. If you have friends over and they make a mess, be sure to clean up after them. If you make it clear to your roomi that you respect their space, they will most likely do the same. This practice will help you avoid roommate problems</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. If all else fails, move out</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/S5ExJ6xbV0l9Eo9gWW" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/S5ExJ6xbV0l9Eo9gWW/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If being with your roomi is really unbearable and nothing else has worked, it’s okay to move out and find another place. Stay with a friend or move in with the fam while you look for a new apartment. If moving out simply isn&#8217;t an option, you and your roomi will have to work out a situation that works for both of you &#8211; even if that means planning your schedules so you don&#8217;t run into each other in communal areas too often.</p>

<p>Living with a roommate for the first time is a huge life adjustment. The prospect of living with a stranger can be intimidating, but it shouldn’t be! Having a roommate can be an awesome experience &#8211; you could even find a new friend, or in some cases fall in <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/33-signs-youre-falling-for-your-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">love with your roommate</a>! (Which, we admit, isn&#8217;t always an easy ride.)</p>



<p>Even though living with a roommate can be a great experience, it is important that the two of you communicate and set up ground rules. Your new roomi isn’t a mind reader, so they need to know what your boundaries are and what your living style is. Here are 7 tips and tricks for building a great relationship with your new roomi.</p>

<p>Talk to one another! It’s super important to communicate with your new roommate about how you live and what you expect from them. It&#8217;s not healthy to keep thoughts bottled up for too long, so be sure to gently communicate your thoughts and feelings to them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Discuss what you want to share</h2>



<p>This is crucial! Make sure you set up ground rules for what you do and don’t want to share with your roommate. Communicate with them about whether you are willing to share food, kitchen appliances, etc or if you’d rather have your own things.</p>



<p>If you would rather your roommate not share your carton of milk, be sure to tell them! Try dedicating certain shelves in the fridge or pantry for each of your belongings so you don’t accidentally use each other’s groceries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Your roommate won’t always be your best friend</h2>



<p>Having a roommate can be a super fun experience. But, it’s also normal to not always get <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-my-roommate-is-driving-me-up-the-wall-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">along with your roommate</a>. Don’t feel pressured for your roomi to be your new best friend. Make sure that you and your roommate have your own space and alone time. Don’t feel like you need to hangout with your roommate 24/7; you each have your own lives and it is important to have your own personal space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tell each other about your living styles and habits</h2>

<p>Make sure to communicate this! Since you’re going to be living with another person, it’s important to let them know your habits and living styles. Are you a morning person or a night owl? Do you like keeping your room clean or are you on the messy side? Be sure to let your roomi know about your living habits, so you know what to expect from each other.</p>



<p>By the way &#8211; if you are messy, this is the time to learn to clean up after yourself; you don&#8217;t want to turn into the roommate from hell!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure to be open to compromise</h2>



<p>Listen to your roomi and acknowledge their thoughts and feelings. Be open to the fact that your roommate is a different person than you, so there will be a need to compromise on some issues. Does your roomi go to bed early and prefer you to keep the noise down past 10? Respect your roommate’s living habits and be sure to be open to what your roommate wants from you, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be respectful</h2>



<p>Respect is key! Since you’re going to be sharing a living space with another person, you need to respect their personal space and living habits. Treat your new roomie how you would want to be treated. Having friends over one night? Be respectful and make sure to check with your roommate to see if they&#8217;re okay with that. It’s their home too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create a roommate agreement</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/whatwedointheshadows-what-we-do-in-the-shadows-orchard-3otOKCOHz2gIlic63e"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/3otOKCOHz2gIlic63e/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C268&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jemaine Clement Roommate GIF by What We Do In The Shadows - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="268" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>This is an awesome way to lay out what each of your rules and expectations is for one another. Creating a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/essential-clauses-for-a-roommate-agreement-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate agreement</a> can be a helpful tool in figuring out what each of you is okay with. Set aside some time with your roomi to create an agreement and talk about what you each expect from one another.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mom, I do this walk everyday, I’ll be fine!” Your parents might worry about you living in the big city. </span>B<span style="font-weight: 400;">ut at least they won’t have to worry about who you are living with. Roomi is excited to offer thorough background checks in NYC from September 5th to October 5 th only</span>. And the<span style="font-weight: 400;"> background checks will cost just $6.99!</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to searching for rooms and roommates we believe safety is everything. Now, in addition to verifying potential roomies’ social media accounts, you can require background checks in NYC to really get to know who they are before you decide to live together. </span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Putting the “I” in ID: What the new background check looks for</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roomi’s new background checks in NYC are incredibly thorough. </span>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">nd it applies to both people listing rooms and those searching for them. The background check will find criminal records involving violence, theft, sexual or substance abuse, fraud and property damage.</span></p>



<p>What it doesn&#8217;t cover is c<span style="font-weight: 400;">rimes against fashion, unfortunately</span>!<span style="font-weight: 400;"> There’s no guarantee your roommate’s pet isn’t a serial shoe chewer either… but at least <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-to-do-roommate-stealing/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">you know your shoes won’t get stolen</a>!</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Roomi’s security partners for background checks in NYC: Identity.com</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way our background checks work is pretty straightforward. The first step is to verify your identity</span>. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the powerful and easy to use service scans IDs to ensure you are who you say you are. Then, Roomi sends the info to the security pros at </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.identity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identity.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who handle the full-blown background checks in NYC.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>Save big with Roomi’s limited time introductory rate</b> for background checks in NYC</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you successfully complete the background checks, you will earn a special badge on your Roomi profile.</span> This is<span style="font-weight: 400;"> so potential roommates can quickly see if you have completed the background check. Those of you who do the background check will have a big advantage in finding the best roommate possible.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no charge for background checks in NYC on Roomi if you’re listing a room. </span>B<span style="font-weight: 400;">ut if you are searching for a room, there’s normally a $24.99 fee. We say “normally,” because this fall we are running an introductory deal on the whole thing. So get yourself verified now, save some cash (like $18 to be exact!) and find the best roommate opportunities around on Roomi. &nbsp;</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Press Release:</b></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Roomi Launches Tools for Background Checks in NYC to Screen Potential Renters </b></h3>



<p><b>NEW YORK, September 5, 2017 – </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roomi, the leading shared housing marketplace, announced today it will begin using tools for background checks in NYC to ensure that users can safely vet and connect with prospective roommates when they list their vacant rooms on the platform. The tools will ensure that current tenants (listers) and prospective roommates (movers) do not have a criminal record. The new tool for background checks in NYC will enhance the likelihood of a safe, trustworthy environment for both the lister and the mover. The background check will include a search for criminal records involving violence, theft, sexual or substance abuse, fraud and property damage.</span></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is the process for background checks?</h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mover or lister must verify their identification as per the norms of background checks in NYC. </span>As an applicant you will be asked<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to confirm </span>your<span style="font-weight: 400;"> identity through a social media site such as Facebook or LinkedIn. Then provide proof of their identity by uploading their driver’s license or by confirming personal information. 75 percent of users connect social media platforms to their accounts. &nbsp;After the applicant’s identification is verified, Roomi forwards the information to Identity.com to run the background check. Roomi will launch a special $7 introductory campaign for 30 days from September 5 to October 5. This special offer is reduced from the standard price of $24.99. Listers can be screened at no charge. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After successfully passing background checks in NYC, Roomi will issue a special badge to respective movers and listers.</span> Thereafter, it will<span style="font-weight: 400;"> be attached to</span> profiles<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the messaging area of Roomi’s platform.</span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Roomi, our success is dependent on the safety and satisfaction of our users. Our background check service will provide an extra level of safety for both listers and movers. It will help build trust between the two parties, which we recognize is very important when choosing a place to live.”</span></p><cite>Ajay Yadav, CEO at Roomi</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus far, several hundred people have enrolled. </span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About Roomi</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roomi</span>, a <span style="font-weight: 400;">free mobile app is made to simplify the roommate and housing search process. CEO and founder Ajay Yadav developed Roomi to address the “obvious need” for a tool to help people find housing and compatible roommates. Launched in 2015, Roomi is based in New York City. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>A roommate finder app can be quite a helpful tool in the search when the need for a roommate arises. Here's everything you should be on the lookout for!</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/3-best-features-roommate-finder/">3 Best Features In A Roommate Finder</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com">Roomi | blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A roommate finder app, service, and websites all come with a host of offerings. But what features make the best roommate finder? To answer that question, it’s important to understand how top features benefit the most important part of the equation. That is</span> you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Every roommate finder needs to have phone support.</h2>



<p>The only thing that stands by your side during your hectic day from the moment you wake up to whenever you finally think about sleep is your phone. Some roommate finders provide it, but it ends up being such a watered-down version of the real deal that it just doesn’t do it for you. A strong phone app benefits you because it:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A roommate finder app needs to be focused on saving your time.</h2>



<p>Let’s face it, you can’t afford to bounce between a desktop computer for this and a watered-down phone app for that like an over-caffeinated ping-pong ball. Because whoever made that stupid rule that a day should only have 24 hours has clearly never held two jobs before.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Their goal should be to simplify your search.</h2>



<p>Life is so much easier when you can do everything from a single source like a phone app. Your roommate search just went from the bottom of the procrastination list to the top of today’s to-do list.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The importance of lifestyle choices, and house rules!</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House rules will let two unique individuals live in blissful harmony, or serve as the basis for a nuclear meltdown in the courtesy department. They are also much more than just convenient search filter settings. They give you insight into who this person is. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are they a semi-pro-shopaholic? Or is the only plastic in their wallet a library card? </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easily searchable lifestyle choices and house rules help you because</span>:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><b>You gain an instant sense of who this person is</b>.</h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a glance, you can pick up on all sorts of personality traits, saving you major headaches after the lease is signed.</span></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><b>You can search faster by filtering “gotta have it” traits and “not happening” factors</b>.</h4>



<p>J<span style="font-weight: 400;">ust checking or unchecking a few boxes saves gobs of time by excluding people you just know you can’t get along with and focusing your search on those who could work out.</span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.pexels.com/photos/4126776/pexels-photo-4126776.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="Happy smiling young roommates in casual clothes sitting on floor with laptop and earphones and browsing smartphone together at home, having found each other on a roommate finder app"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should let you get to know your roommates like you did your friends!</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filters simplify your search life, but you can’t really be sure until you’ve interacted with a potential roommate. You’re about to spend about a year with a total stranger, so investing a week or more to get to know someone before they move in doesn’t seem like a lot to ask. And yet, many roommate finders don’t offer that feature. Or if they do, it’s through clunky email that feels more like blind-throwing messages in a bottle back and forth between trenches than actually growing to understand another person. Secure instant messaging is a key feature in great roommate finder apps. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It benefits you by:</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Letting you get to know someone naturally</b>.</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texting back and forth was a fundamental part of how you got to know lots of the friends you have today. A roommate finder app shouldn’t be any different.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Keeps your personal information secure</b>.</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your personal email address to a complete stranger is not easy to take back. And yeah, most people are chill, but it’s the smaller community of full-time whackos you have to watch out for. Secure texting lets you get to know somebody without exchanging your personal information so you can get a sense of whether this person is or is not a card-carrying member of crazy land.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you dash off to find a roommate finder with all those features, let us make it easy for you.</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Roomi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has all that and more. Not only does it showcase stellar phone app support, time-saving lifestyle choice filters, and secure chat, but it helps you find rooms too just as easily.</span></p>
