<p>To make your front door even more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1ffe4xMDyE" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">festive</a>, stop by your local grocery store and pick up a few pumpkins and potted fall plants such as marigolds, and add a pop of color to your front step. Decorating with plants is cheap, environmentally friendly and looks super pretty!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create a decorative centerpiece</h2>



<p>A centerpiece decoration is a must-have for any holiday dinner. There’s no need to overspend and purchase an expensive centerpiece when it’s easy to make one on your own! Head over to an arts and crafts store like <a href="https://www.michaels.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Micheals</a>, and pick out a wooden rectangular box, a few small pumpkins, decorative leaves, and some large candles.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how to make your DIY Thanksgiving decoration. Firstly, take your box and scatter the leaves as desired inside. Then, take your candles and pumpkins and place them side by side inside the box, alternating between pumpkin and candle. And viola! A perfect and easy to make fall centerpiece.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">DIY Thanksgiving Turkeys</h2>



<p>This is the perfect arts and crafts project to enjoy with a few close friends or family members, plus, this decoration idea won’t break the bank! All you’ll need is construction paper, scissors, and crayons or pencils. Put on your favorite holiday movie and have fun with this DIY thanksgiving decoration!</p>



<p>Take a brown piece of construction paper and place your non-dominant hand onto it with your fingers spread apart. Next, trace your hand on the construction paper. Take scissors and cut out the outline of your hand. Use colored pencils to create your turkey! You can repeat this process to create multiple turkeys that you can use as decorations on your fridge or windows.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Festive fall leaf DIY lanterns</h2>



<p>One of the super fun DIY Thanksgiving decorations to try! Stop spending money on cute, expensive candles and make your own instead! All you’ll need is a mason jar (or multiple depending on how many lanterns you want to make), decorative leaves, modge podge, a paintbrush, and a small tea light.</p>

<p>First, take your jar and and cover it in a thin layer of modge podge with your paintbrush. Next, take a leaf and place it on your jar until it sticks. Continue this process until the leaves cover the entire jar. Next, paint another layer of modge podge on top of the leaves so that they stay in place. Let the jar dry. Once it’s dry, place the tea light inside, light the candle&#8230; and voilà! A festive fall candle &#8211; the perfect addition to any room.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Candy corn garland: Decor everyone&#8217;s going to love!</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/cutesy-halloween-food-ideas-to-die-for-roomi/2121/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do you have a sweet tooth?</a> This DIY decoration is perfect for you! All that you’ll need for this project is a few bags of candy corn, thin string, and a sewing needle.</p>



<p>First, you’re going to cut your string to the desired length. Tie one end of the string in a knot so the candy corn does not fall off. Next, you are going to tie the sewing needle at the end of the string so you can string the candy corn together. One by one, poke the candy corn through the string until the string is full.</p>



<p>Try adding this festive garland on a mantle or drape it over a window for an extra pop of color!</p>

<p>Here’s another creative way to incorporate pumpkins into your decor! In order to do this DIY, you’ll need a few mini pumpkins (however many you want), tealights that are able to fit inside the pumpkins, scissors, and black pipe cleaners.</p>



<p>First, you’re going to carve the pumpkins and scoop out the insides. Next, you’re going to place the tealights inside of the pumpkins. Then cut six equal pieces of black pipe cleaner. Mold each piece of the pipe cleaner into a bent spider leg and attach three pieces to each side of the pumpkin to make a pumpkin spider. Add these creepy candles to any centerpiece to spice up a room!</p>
