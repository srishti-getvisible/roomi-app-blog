<p>Many people look at failing in a negative light. But it&#8217;s important to remember that failure means that you&#8217;re trying. To err is human; no matter how successful you get, be assured that you&#8217;re still going to make mistakes. So it&#8217;s okay to make career mistakes too &#8211; we all do it!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I&#8217;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I&#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.&#8221;</p><cite><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Being mindful about career mistakes and learning from them will bring you a step closer to personal growth and success. Many people with high-pressure jobs spend their entire careers geared towards reaching their desired position but end up dreading their career journey. If you&#8217;re struggling at work, have just began your career or know someone who&#8217;s feeling stuck at work, continue reading. Here are some of the biggest career mistakes you can avoid (or make them and lean from them!)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Letting another person make your career decisions = biggest career mistake!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/HozfRdy8Qe4hVsbkk2" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/HozfRdy8Qe4hVsbkk2/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Each person is unique with their own set of experiences, thought patterns and preferences. You might turn to your best buddies for an outfit approval while shopping or you might seek approval from your parents when you&#8217;re making a big life decision but remember that it&#8217;s YOU in the end who has to deal with all consequences- good or bad. When it comes to your career, it&#8217;s natural to consult your core group, but don&#8217;t let your inner voice drown out. Trust your gut and find your inner voice of reason and make that voice your priority.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Not being able to balance your personal &amp; professional life</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/111LSMM1ICPqBq" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/111LSMM1ICPqBq/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>We usually spend eight to ten hours of our day at work &#8211; maybe more &#8211; so it&#8217;s understandable that some of us might make work our identity. Before your career takes an all assuming role, remember that finding balance in life is like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. A healthy life comprises of a good balance of work, family, friends, and mental health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. A perception that once you choose a field, you are stuck with it forever is one of the most common career mistakes</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:42%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l4FGquSwfx52EPXzO" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FGquSwfx52EPXzO/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Many of us think it is impossible to switch career paths after training and gaining experience in a particular domain. If you want, you can gradually transition to other fields. In today&#8217;s digital world, you&#8217;re subconsciously learning new things through social media, so focus on marketable skills and keep your eyes open for opportunities of your interest. You never know what you can achieve.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Burning all bridges</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6v4VaKAwgmLoA" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/6v4VaKAwgmLoA/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>It might seem right to sever all contacts and say good riddance when switching to your new career. Whatever be your reason for moving on, and whether you had a good experience or a bad one, keep networking with your old employer, you never know when you will require their help or reference.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Assuming you&#8217;re indispensable</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:53%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/HFHovXXltzS7u" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/HFHovXXltzS7u/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Never think of yourself as indispensable &#8211; feel grateful that you have the opportunity to contribute at work. Nobody is bigger than the organization and its goals. If you are not contributing, you might be a burden to the company. One example is Uber, where the founder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/technology/uber-travis-kalanick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Travis Kalanick was forced to resign</a> in 2017. Don&#8217;t know about you but it can be difficult for some folks to avoid career mistakes such as this one! Esp. if you&#8217;re a workaholic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Talking bad and gossiping is the worst career mistake out there!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT9KVuimKtly3zoJ0Y" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9KVuimKtly3zoJ0Y/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>The &#8216;mean girls&#8217; approach just doesn&#8217;t cut it at work. Avoid negativity at the workplace, and at all costs, avoid gossiping &#8211; negative things bubble up very quickly, noise gets created, and you will be found out sooner rather than later. Never ever jeopardize your relationship with anyone in your current organization. The industry is such a funny place, you&#8217;ll not even know when your current manager will be your lead in your forthcoming career path, OR your future plans might not fall in place, and you might have to take help from your current employer.</p>
