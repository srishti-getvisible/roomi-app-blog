										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Creating a thriving workplace means focusing on more than just deadlines and goals. Employee well-being drives motivation, creativity, and loyalty.</p>



<p>Wellness programs—when done right—bring balance to work life. From life coaching to nutritional consulting, these initiatives foster health in the workplace.</p>



<p>So how do you weave wellness into your business without losing sight of practicality? The key is integration: aligning well-being with business strategies for mutual benefits.</p>



<p>Read along as we break down realistic approaches that fit every organization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Creating Flexible Scheduling for Wellness Activities</h2>



<p>Due to rigid schedules, employees often feel they can’t prioritize wellness. Businesses that incorporate flexibility empower their teams to embrace well-being without added stress.</p>



<p>Allow time during work hours for activities like yoga, guided meditation, or life coaching. You don&#8217;t need a complex overhaul; small adjustments work wonders. For example, provide extended lunch breaks once a week or block specific times for team-wide wellness initiatives.</p>



<p>Flexibility doesn’t mean sacrificing productivity. It enhances it by reducing burnout and improving focus. Morale grows stronger when employees see leadership support in balancing health and workload.</p>



<p>Some businesses find success in offering staggered shifts or hybrid models that align with personal routines better. This approach meets both organizational goals and individual needs for employees to <a href="https://esblog.roomiapp.com/us/career/top-tips-for-professional-growth-in-2021-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find professional growth</a>.</p>



<p>Remember—flexible scheduling is about trust and respect. Allowing employees to invest in themselves creates an engaged workforce ready to perform at its best!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Delivering Tailored Life Coaching: In-Person and Remote Options</h2>



<p>Life coaching equips staff with strategies for goal-setting, stress management, and enhancing the equilibrium between their professional and personal lives. By offering this service as part of your wellness program, you support their personal and professional growth simultaneously.</p>



<p>Here’s how to integrate it:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>On-site sessions:</strong> Bring certified coaches to the workplace for <a href="https://wpamelia.com/wordpress-booking-coaching/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled one-on-one consultations</a>. Employees benefit from convenient access without needing extra time outside work.</li>



<li><strong>Virtual coaching:</strong> Provide flexibility by allowing staff to connect with coaches online, accommodating different time zones or hybrid schedules.</li>



<li><strong>Group workshops:</strong> Organize team-wide seminars focusing on mindset building, communication skills, or career development tips that boost collaboration.</li>
</ul>



<p>Use tools like <a href="https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The QR Code Generator</a> to share agendas and sign-up forms instantly through posters or internal dashboards. Tailor options based on individual needs rather than a “one-size-fits-all” approach. </p>



<p>Personalized life coaching builds confidence while reducing employee stress levels—creating a happier environment overall! Whether on-site or remote, investing in tailored solutions demonstrates genuine care for your team’s well-being and success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Working Hand-in-hand with Diet Experts for Custom Meal Guidance</h2>



<p>Nutrition is a cornerstone for vitality, concentration, and output. By collaborating with dieticians, employees gain insights into nutritious eating habits, which fosters a culture of wellness within the workplace and extends outward. These experts can tailor individual meal strategies or conduct educational sessions on maintaining a balanced diet.</p>



<p>To enhance the process, consider utilizing logistical solutions like a <a href="https://www.dropoff.com/">same day courier</a> service to deliver healthy meals or snacks directly to the workplace. Employees enjoy convenient access to nutritious options without extra effort on their part.</p>



<p>For example, some businesses collaborate with local farms or meal-prep companies. With same-day delivery in place, fresh ingredients or ready-to-eat meals arrive promptly—reinforcing your commitment to employee wellness.</p>



<p>Accessible nutrition resources show your team that you care about their health holistically. This small but impactful gesture reduces stress around food planning while boosting morale and fostering a supportive company culture built on wellness priorities!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Utilizing Employee Feedback to Shape Wellness Initiatives</h2>



<p>Every workforce is unique, so wellness programs succeed when they reflect the actual needs of employees. Gathering consistent feedback ensures your initiatives remain relevant and impactful.</p>



<p></p>



<p>&#8220;Implementing a wellness initiative isn&#8217;t just about ticking boxes,&#8221; says Colin Pearson from <a href="https://stantonhouseinn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stanton House Inn</a> in Greenwich, CT. &#8220;It&#8217;s about creating an environment where employees can truly thrive. The key is to ensure it&#8217;s both practical and personalized, allowing team members to engage in ways that work best for their individual needs and schedules.&#8221;</p>



<p></p>



<p>Surveys, suggestion boxes, or casual team discussions can help uncover what employees value most. Some might prefer group fitness classes; others may need stress management workshops. But collecting data isn’t enough—it’s how you use it that matters.</p>



<p>Leverage data integration solutions to organize and analyze feedback efficiently. By connecting responses across platforms into one accessible system, you gain clear insights into trends and priorities without losing crucial details.</p>



<p>For instance, a business could identify that many employees request on-site nutritional support while also expressing interest in mindfulness practices. With this knowledge centralized through effective tools, leaders confidently tailor wellness strategies for maximum benefit.</p>



<p>Integrating employee input builds trust while ensuring programs stay meaningful over time—resulting in greater participation and positive outcomes! Incorporating <a href="https://www.successories.com/promotional-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">branded corporate products</a> into these initiatives can further boost engagement and reinforce company identity among employees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Initiating Workout Competitions to Boost Team Unity</h2>



<p>Fitness contests inspire staff to maintain an active lifestyle and simultaneously build a spirit of fellowship and collective effort. They transform wellness into a fun, shared experience rather than an individual effort.</p>



<p>Here’s how businesses can introduce them:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Set achievable goals:</strong> Design challenges around accessible activities like daily step counts or stretching routines. Make sure objectives suit various fitness levels.</li>



<li><strong>Offer rewards:</strong> Incentivize participation with perks such as gift cards, extra PTO, or wellness-related prizes like gym memberships. Small tokens keep motivation high.</li>



<li><strong>Encourage group involvement:</strong> Create team-based competitions to build connections across departments and encourage accountability through friendly rivalry.</li>
</ul>



<p>For those participating from home, businesses can promote tools for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/5-total-body-workouts-at-home-with-sunny-health-and-fitness/">total body workouts</a>. This ensures that everyone—whether in-office or remote—has equal opportunities to stay engaged in the challenge.</p>



<p>These activities boost morale while addressing physical health proactively—energizing your workforce both physically and mentally for better productivity and workplace satisfaction overall!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Financing Better Nutritional Choices at Work</h2>



<p>Providing healthy food in the workplace signals a commitment to employee health. Financially supporting the purchase of wholesome foods not only promotes sound eating behaviors but also cultivates a work environment that values wellness.</p>



<p>Companies can partner with nearby purveyors or prepared meal companies to offer nutritious, freshly made meals and snacks. By absorbing some of the expense, businesses enhance the allure and availability of good nutrition over typical fast-food options.</p>



<p>Some organizations go further by setting up in-house cafeterias offering discounted salads, whole-grain dishes, and protein-packed meals. For smaller offices without dining facilities, vending machines stocked with nutrient-dense snacks serve as an easy solution.</p>



<p>Healthy eating fuels focus and productivity throughout the day while reducing midday energy crashes linked to high-sugar or processed foods.</p>



<p>Employees appreciate this thoughtful support for their overall wellness—fostering loyalty and reinforcing your company’s commitment to long-term health initiatives!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Designing Spaces Specifically for Relaxation and Mindfulness Practices</h2>



<p>A workplace designed to support relaxation creates a sanctuary where employees can recharge during demanding days. Dedicated spaces for mindfulness help reduce stress, improve focus, and foster a more positive atmosphere.</p>



<p>Here’s how businesses can create these areas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Quiet rooms:</strong> Set aside soundproofed rooms equipped with soft lighting and comfortable seating for activities like meditation or quiet reading.</li>



<li><strong>Mindfulness zones:</strong> Include tools such as yoga mats, guided meditation apps, or calming music to encourage mental clarity and stress relief.</li>



<li><strong>Outdoor areas:</strong> If possible, design outdoor spaces with greenery where employees can connect with nature—a proven way to enhance mental well-being.</li>
</ul>



<p>These thoughtfully crafted environments signal that employee health is more than just a checkbox item. Instead of pushing through stress-filled moments at their desks, your team has an opportunity to reset—ultimately increasing productivity while enhancing workplace satisfaction!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Wrapping Up: Wellness as the Foundation of a Thriving Workplace</h3>



<p>Incorporating wellness programs isn’t just an add-on; it’s a strategy that defines how businesses value their teams. By offering life coaching, nutritional support, and creating spaces for relaxation, companies show employees they are more than their job titles—they are individuals whose health matters.</p>



<p>When well-being becomes central to workplace culture, employees feel motivated and supported. This leads to increased engagement, reduced turnover rates, and stronger performance overall.</p>



<p>Building these programs doesn’t have to be complicated. Small steps like flexible scheduling or subsidizing healthy meals make a significant impact over time. The benefits extend beyond morale—wellness fuels long-term success.</p>



<p>Prioritize your team’s health today because thriving employees build thriving organizations tomorrow!</p>

<p>After a long day of work, the last thing any of us want to do is go slog in the kitchen for a half-decent meal. I mean cooking just involves so many steps. There’s the washing, the chopping, the actual cooking, and then if that’s not enough, there’s also the clean-up afterwards. So, it’s no surprise most of us end up getting DoorDash meals most work nights. But now those bills are adding up on your card and you’re wondering if there’s anyway to make cooking easier. Well, this is where Roomi comes in. We’ve got 5 great kitchen tricks for you that will change your life. Whether you’ve never stepped foot in a kitchen before, or you’re a professional chef, these kitchen hacks will appeal to all. So, sit back and watch us blow your mind with these amazing kitchen tips and hacks!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Easy ginger trick: One of the greatest kitchen hacks</h2>



<p>Ginger is something that most of us have in our pantry. They add so much flavor to food and have so much nutritional value. Not to mention, <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-ginger-tea-3377239" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ginger tea</a> is one of God’s greatest creations and we stand by that. But for how delicious they are, they can be quite a pain in the ass. I mean, peeling ginger is one of the most annoying things on the planet. I mean, a ginger root has so many nooks and crannies that peeling it takes <em>forever</em>.</p>



<p>So, here’s one of our great kitchen tricks: Scrap the skin of the ginger with a spoon, don’t bother doing it with a knife. And wherever it gets too tough… leave the skin on. There’s no harm in consuming ginger skin, so why bother trying to get every bit of it off! Isn’t that so liberating?!</p>

<p>If you’re like us, you want to put garlic on everything. I mean, why not? It’s one of the most delicious flavors on this planet. Honestly, we’ve never listened to recipes when they ask us to use 3 garlic cloves. It’s double or nothing for us! Which is what makes this trick one of the best kitchen tips in the world. Peeling garlic is the most boring part of cooking. So, what if we told you that you can actually peel up to 20 garlics in under 20 seconds? Sounds insane, right? But it really isn’t. Check out this video on how to do it. It truly is one of the best kitchen hacks! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Microwave your veggies</h2>



<p>This is one of our favorite kitchen tips/hacks ever! If you’ve ever tried to cook roasted potatoes on a Wednesday night, you’re keenly aware of how long it takes to cook them through. Cooking vegetables often takes a very long time, which can be very annoying when all you want is a quick and healthy meal. So in order to cut your cooking time in half, microwave your veggies first. Yes, it’s that easy! Place your veggies in a pot of water and then stick it in the microwave. You can do this with any vegetable that takes a bit long to cook on the stove. How long you need to microwave veggies for will vary based on the veggie and the strength of your microwave. Just make sure it&#8217;s soft when you cut into it. Yeah, it’s that easy!</p>

Just cook your <a href="https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/how-to-meal-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meals</a> beforehand and then have a stress free week!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We&#8217;ve lost count of how many days it&#8217;s been since the dreaded &#8216;rona came around.</p>



<p>But let&#8217;s say it like this &#8211; it&#8217;s year 2 of corona and we&#8217;re still partially stuck indoors in our apartments. When we do go out, however, our mouths are shut in masks and we feel suffocated, still.</p>



<p>And if we happen to meet our friends and family, coming back to our apartment feels somehow worse, even if we co live with roomis.</p>



<p>Hello, coronavirus cabin fever!</p>



<p>The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines cabin fever as <strong><em>extreme irritability and restlessness from living in isolation or a confined indoor area for a prolonged time.</em></strong></p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all been feeling the symptoms of coronavirus cabin fever ever since the start of 2020. I think that&#8217;s a fair assumption.</p>



<p>To say the least, we&#8217;re sick of being in our apartments, and chances are, our apartments and roomis might have grown sick of us too.</p>



<p>Now while not everyone may feel the same symptoms or the same intensity of coronavirus cabin fever, it&#8217;s safe to assume that we&#8217;re all feeling it.</p>



<p>So here are some ways we&#8217;re dealing with the coronavirus cabin fever. Hoping you find solace in them too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Learning to deal with isolation from the cosmonauts</h2>



<p>So astronauts deal with <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/creative-things-self-isolation/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-isolation</a> for life, don&#8217;t they? When they&#8217;re not isolated, they&#8217;re certainly practicing or training for it.</p>



<p>Even if they co-live with other astronauts, and are not completely isolated, being in a space machine must be far tougher than what we&#8217;re having to deal with. Think how they can&#8217;t even go out for a bike ride or a long walk in the park with the masks on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541739358-9f3a2a3b6559?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=967&amp;q=80" alt="isolation, Coronavirus Cabin Fever"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So how do they do it?</h3>



<p>As we learned from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200408-an-astronauts-guide-to-surviving-isolation" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">astronauts who spoke about isolation with the BBC</a>, the first thing we need to do is accept our situation and get comfortable with it. The fact of the matter is there&#8217;s no running away from our apartments and we&#8217;re all stuck in this together.</p>



<p>So to learn how to deal with the coronavirus cabin fever, we need to stop wine-ing and whining, and completely accept our circumstances.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Make a schedule that keeps you busy and entertained</h2>



<p>When we talk of being entertained, the first thought that might pop up in our brains is <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/7-binge-worthy-netflix-shows-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> or other entertainment sites on the internet. Which is fine, but after a point of time, it might seem like these things are draining us out.</p>



<p>And they surely do! We lose track of time, we stop caring about our health and fitness, and the people we co-live with.And soon we become passive zombies looking for the next new distraction from the coronavirus cabin fever.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582812532891-7968f272fc9a?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=967&amp;q=80" alt="coronavirus cabin fever"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How will a schedule help?</h3>



<p>But we should realize that if we are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-work-from-home-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">working from home with roomis</a> in our apartments, we&#8217;re the lucky ones. And when you have luck on your side, it&#8217;s best to play our best game and get the best things out of our time.</p>



<p>And this would be possible only with a good schedule that includes taking care of our health and fitness.This includes <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/reddit-tips-for-when-you-cant-sleep-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a time to sleep</a> and wake up, a time to work, and a time to play.</p>



<p>This will help the time pass easily without making us feel the dread of coronavirus cabin fever! So jot down all the things you wish to do in a day and make a schedule that supports those wishes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Move your body</h2>



<p>The most important thing to put in your schedule is a time and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/home-environment-and-healthy-living-habits-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">place in your home for health and fitness</a>. Whether your health and fitness regime is supported by a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/creating-a-budget-friendly-gym-at-home-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">home gym</a>, or a dance routine, or Yoga, there are limitless benefits of moving your body every day.</p>



<p>The serotonin (the happy hormone) flowing through your veins would keep you happy, energized, and productive. Bonus: you&#8217;ll find yourself dealing with the coronavirus cabin fever better when you work out for health and fitness.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487956382158-bb926046304a?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1051&amp;q=80" alt="work out for health and fitness"/></figure>



<p>And since quarantine hit, we know we&#8217;ve been munching too much and thinking about health and fitness too less. So why not work out so you can fit into your old pair of jeans again?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Spend time with roomis</h2>



<p>In times like these, the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/taking-coronavirus-precautions-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roomis you co-live with</a> at your apartment are all you&#8217;ve got, whether you like it or not! So do the needful and carve out plans for some quality time with the roomis who co-live with you.</p>



<p>Bond with them overcooking, or drinking, or just lazing around and watching movies. Social interaction is of utmost importance, and we&#8217;re all feeling the lack of it. Yes, even the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">socially anxious among us</a>!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601758003122-53c40e686a19?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1050&amp;q=80" alt="two roommate spending time with their dogs " width="610" height="406"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What if there&#8217;s conflict?</h3>



<p>And yes, since we&#8217;re all stuck indoors with the roomis we co-live with, there&#8217;s bound to be conflicts too! So anticipate the conflicts that you might have to face and how you would resolve them. Also try and be on your best behavior. It&#8217;s a stressful time, even for the annoying roomi in your shared apartment.</p>



<p>So <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/bond-with-your-roommate-with-these-fun-traditions-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make the roomis you co-live with feel loved</a> as often as you can and they would surely return the favor to help deal with coronavirus cabin fever.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Pick up something new to learn</h2>



<p>Now with our time alone at home, there are bound to be times when we&#8217;re tired of spending time and doing things with the roomis. So while you hibernate in your room, stop thinking about how bored you are.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1475275166152-f1e8005f9854?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1052&amp;q=80" alt="a woman playing piano "/></figure>



<p>Instead, pick up a hobby or a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/inspiring-quotes-to-help-you-learn-new-skills-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skill you&#8217;ve always wanted to learn</a> to deal with coronavirus cabin fever. Take leverage of the internet and use it for something other than browsing memes! Trust that your future self will thank you for making good use of this time.</p>

<p>¡Nuestros amados tips de vida adulta harán que tu día a día sea mucho más fácil! Cuando recién saliste de la casa de tus papás y comienzas la vida de adulto independiente, te vas dando cuenta que la comida no se hace sola, los recibos se tiene que pagar y la ropa no se plancha mágicamente. Es por eso que este blog con algunos secretos para mejor tu vida adula te serán de gran ayuda ¡Después cuéntanos si te funcionaron!</p>



<p>1. Planchar de por sí, ya es todo un dilema (bueno, es una de las cosas que nosotros más odiamos hacer :P), pero si tienes que planchar pantalones, camisas o cualquier otra cosa, utiliza pasadores, así quedará todo parejo.</p>



<p>2. <a href="https://www.quotatis.es/consejos-reformas/preguntas-frecuentes/pintura-suelos-y-paredes/como-pintar-sin-ensuciar-trucos-consejos/" class="broken_link">¿Cómo pintar sin ensuciar?</a> Cubre con aluminio o papel esos detalles que quieres cuidar mientras pasas la brocha en tus paredes. Tu adulto interior te lo agradecerá más adelante. </p>



<p>3. Un gran life hack es que uses a full tu toallero, será el implemento perfecto para colgar tus productos de limpieza  de baño o cocina.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.dadaroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/life-hacks-dada-room-secretos-que-amar%C3%A1s-depa-de-soltera-ba%C3%B1o.jpg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="life hacks dada room secretos que amarás depa de soltera baño" class="wp-image-3991"/></figure>



<p>4. Un secreto, si tu florero es demasiado grande y las flores tienen el tallo pequeño, coloca popotes transparentes o verdes. Harán que los ramos se vean más frondosos. </p>



<p>5. ¡Tenemos que aplicar este life hack ahora! Cuando los zapatos no caben en un solo lugar del closet lo mejor será usar un organizador de tela para tener un espacio extra. ¡La verdad nos parece buenísima idea! DIY perfecto.</p>





<p>6. Un mega tip de la vida adulta es agregar la mezcla de hot cakes en una botella de catsup, así será más fácil lograr los circulitos.</p>



<p>7. Uno de los mejores tips de vida adulta: Si sales de viaje, usa gorras de baño para evitar que tus zapatos ensucien la ropa.</p>



<p>8. ¡No tires tu mouse pad! Mejor utilízalo para colocar las ollas calientes.</p>



<p>9. Tip: Plancha pequeños espacios de tus camisas con una alaciadora o si lo prefieres, mira este <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSmlbL87OuA">video</a> de trucos para quitar las arrugas sin necesidad de aparatos. Y recuerda, si  extiendes bien las prendas tan pronto termines de lavarlas, puede que queden lisas; mira estas <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/mexico/como-tender-ropa-en-el-depa/">5 ideas para tender en un espacio pequeño</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you move into your first college dorm, the minute you tape some photos of you and your besties and your favorite band poster to the wall, you feel pretty much at home.&nbsp;But, as you grow up and move into an apartment, the chances are that you’ll be looking for slightly more aesthetically pleasing (and grown up!) ways of making your apartment feel like a ‘home’. If you’re looking for budget apartment hacks to take your interior design game to the next level &#8211; you&#8217;ve come to the right place. We&#8217;ve got some of the best (and cheap) life hacks in the business.</p>



<p>See, you’re in luck, because your friends at Roomi love a life hack or two and we’re always searching for new ways to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/8-ways-to-make-your-bedroom-instagram-worthy-roomi/">make your interior Instagram-worthy</a>!</p>



<p>So, without further ado, here’s our favorite cheap life hacks that’ll make your new space feel less student, and more like you – a responsible adult (kind of!).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Life hacks 101: Frame EVERYTHING</h2>



<p>Okay, not everything… but you know where we’re going with this. The good news is that you don’t have to throw your favorite posters away. All you need to do is buy actual frames for your posters, artwork and photographs of you with your friends. Your chosen frames don’t have to be fancy either, a simple black or white frame from somewhere like Target or Ikea will do. The addition of framed art and photographs will definitely add personality to your space without breaking the bank balance. This is one of the best apartment hacks that will give your home a personality on a budget!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Life hacks for the plant lovers!</h2>



<p>Nothing, we repeat NOTHING elevates a space more than a houseplant. From succulents to cacti- there are different types and sizes for every type of home. Start off with a couple and add to your collection if and when you can. There’s no such thing as too much when it comes to our green friends. Roomi team recommends the snake plant, it&#8217;s a favorite over here. And while we’re on the topic of how much we *love* plants, did we mention how good they are for you? They purify the air, boost your mood and can even reduce symptoms of mild stress and anxiety? The power of mother nature.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not sure about what plants to get, here&#8217;s a <a href="https://savvygardening.com/apartment-plants/">really helpful guide</a>!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use books as decoration</h2>



<p>If got heaps of books and random knick-knacks lying around at home, this one&#8217;s for you. Instead of hiding them under your bed never to be seen again, consider piling them on your coffee table, near the couch or even stacking them on some shelves near framed photos. Super affordable without looking ‘cheap’, decorating with books is a trick used by interior designers all over the globe. It&#8217;s truly one of the classiest life hacks of all time! From<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/6-travel-books-for-your-wandering-soul-roomi/"> travel books</a> to your favorite fictional tale- they add color and personality to your space! And what’s not to love about showing off how well-read you are?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Portable home bars and trolleys</h2>



<p>This is one of our favorite life hacks! If you’ve got wine bottles taking up valuable space on your kitchen counters, it’s time to give them a proper home. That’s right, it’s time to organize your booze! How very adult of you. We recommend getting a cheap and cheerful bar cart or home trolley. Not only are they great for entertaining, but they add character and color to any home. Another bonus? When your friends leave bottles behind, you can simply pop them on to your bar and add to your collection or tasty décor. Win, win!</p>



<p><strong>If you want some inspiration, <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-29-best-bar-carts-under-dollar500">here&#8217;s a really helpful list </a>of portable home bars starting at $49!</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Invest in your lighting</h2>



<p>People often forget about lighting when they&#8217;re redecorating and it&#8217;s a big mistake! When you first walk into a room, one of the first things people tend to notice is the lighting. This is one of those cheap life hacks that will completely transform your home without much effort! </p>



<p>Many rental apartments come with standard (and not so stylish) lighting fixtures. So, mixing it up with your own light shades, floor lamps and table lamps will make all the difference. From industrial Scandinavian vibes to bohemian style rattan and bold, statement colors, the options are endless. Not only can you change the whole appearance of your apartment whilst remaining within your budget, but there’s something super cozy and welcoming about warm, low lights. Apartment hacks FTW!</p>
