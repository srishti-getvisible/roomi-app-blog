<p>The holiday season is upon us! And now all of the troubles and turmoil this year has come with seem to be at bay,. At least as long as the tree is up, fuzzy socks are hung, and Mariah Carey is being played. So to round it all off? <strong>Curling up with the best Christmas movies on Netflix (<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/easy-cocktail-recipes-to-try-at-home-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and a warm cocktail</a>) is one of the most time-honored traditions.</strong></p>



<p>And we want to help you figure out where to start the holiday indulging. So we have made a list of our favorite Christmas movies on Netflix!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <em>Christmas in the Heartland</em></h2>



<p>Think&nbsp;<em>The Parent Trap</em>, but set during the Christmas season. And it makes for one of the cutest Christmas movies on Netflix! So as the story goes, Kara Gentry (Sierra McCormick) and Jessie Wilkins (Brighton Sharbino) meet on an aeroplane headed to the same town. Furthermore, the identical girls decide to switch places, and naturally, drama ensues. </p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <em>Santa Girl</em></h2>



<p>Being Santa&#8217;s daughter definitely comes with its own set of challenges. In brief, she&#8217;s all set to marry some pre-approved guy and follow into the family business. Consequently, Cassie Claus (Jennifer Stone) is able to attend a semester of college in the &#8220;real&#8221; world. So safe to say, this is one of the most enigmatic Christmas movies on Netflix.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <em>Christmas With My Father</em></h2>



<p>In brief, comedian Jack Whitehall and his father, Michael, go on adventures around the world in the Netflix show Travels With My Father. So in this Holiday special, the father-son duo in their goofs and grumpy moments apply their signature chemistry. Equally important, the cherry on the top? The Fab Five of Queer Eye help the duo with their bond.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <em>Get Santa</em></h2>



<p>What do you think would go down when Santa shows up in your shed? This is one of the most adorable British Christmas movies on Netflix! And it follows the unfolding of events when a family goes through this same exact thing. So this film has a hapless Santa &#8211; played by Jim Broadbent, a staple in the other quintessential British kids&#8217; movies, Paddington.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. <em>Holly Star</em></h2>



<p>In brief, a broke, down-on-her-luck puppeteer returns home for the holidays. She gets caught up in an exciting treasure hunt with her paintball-obsessed best friend. Along with her tango-dancing grandmother, and a childhood sweetheart. To summarize, this is one of the quirkier Christmas movies on Netflix. And this one&#8217;s bound to make you long for love! ?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. <em>A Cinderella Story: A Christmas Wish</em></h2>



<p>Since the 2004 Hilary Duff hit, the <em>Cinderella Story</em> series has been around like Santa&#8217;s elves. The fifth and most recent installment, starring Laura Marano, is about an aspiring singer-songwriter who gets a shot at stardom and love during the Christmas season. Nevertheless, this is one of the few musical Christmas movies on Netflix you can sing along to!</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. <em>This Christmas</em></h2>



<p>In brief, <em>This Christmas</em> is a Christmas movie on Netflix that centres on the Whitfield family, whose eldest has come home for the first time in four years. In fact, it is inspired by Donna Hathaway&#8217;s 1970 song of the same name. And the family gets together to deal with everything left unsaid, for this intense family Christmas special.</p>

In brief, Angela&#8217;s Christmas turns an incident in McCourt&#8217;s mother&#8217;s childhood in Ireland into one of the most beautiful and kind-hearted animated Christmas movies on Netflix that can be heartily enjoyed by the entire family!</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. <em>A Very Murray Christmas</em></h2>



<p>This is one of those Christmas movies on Netflix that feel too good to be true. It&#8217;s what the industry calls a star-studded Christmas Special, which is <em>about</em> the making of a star-studded Christmas Special! In brief, Sofia Coppola directs the hour-long show, which stars Bill Murray, George Clooney, Amy Poehler, Michael Cera, Chris Rock, Rashida Jones, Miley Cyrus, and many more.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. <em>Drunk Parents</em></h2>



<p>To summarize, Alec Baldwin and Salma Hayek play a couple hiding their dwindling financial situation from their college-aged daughter. With holiday season approaching, so does the daughter&#8217;s time to come back home &#8211; and the parents&#8217; actions are just about to catch up with them. While this could be the premise of a drama, it&#8217;s actually a star-studded Ch, even if its that of an acquired taste kind.</p>
