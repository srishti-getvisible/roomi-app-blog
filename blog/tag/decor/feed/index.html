<p>Cycling may be your eco-friendly choice for transportation, but storing them can be quite challenging. Not sure how you can store a bike in an apartment? Here’s what you need to know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Can You Store a Bike in an Apartment?</h2>



<p>Apart from being an eco-friendly way to get around the city, cycling every day can help you get some fresh air and is a <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits#:~:text=Regular%20cycling%20stimulates%20and%20improves,and%20reduces%20blood%20fat%20levels.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">good way to exercise</a>. However, storing your bike can be difficult, especially if you live in a small apartment. Storing your bike outside is not an ideal solution, even if your building has dedicated areas for bicycles. Keeping your bicycle outside exposes it to weather elements that reduce the longevity of your precious ride.</p>



<p>So, what can you do when you have a small apartment and like to cycle regularly? Well, you have to get creative with how you store your bike in your apartment. From buying bike racks for small apartments, to hanging your bike on your wall, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/iFFas72-dTY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remember Me</a> style, there’s a lot you can do with them! We’ve curated a list of creative, yet practical ways you can store a bike in an apartment to help you get started.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Classic Option: Hang it on the Wall</h2>



<p>The easiest way to store your bicycle in a small apartment without sacrificing your storage or floor place is to hang it on the wall. To mount your bike on a wall you can use simple hooks, or those that are designed for heavier bikes.</p>



<p>Some bike racks are designed for small apartments and allow you to hang up your bike to get it off the floor. Such bike racks help you hang your bike vertically, making it look unique and artistic, rather than a nifty way to save some space.</p>



<p>Mounting the bike on your wall can give your apartment a rustic feel, or you can hang coordinated paintings around it to make it feel like a part of the décor!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Use Your Storage</h2>



<p>If you do not mind sacrificing some storage space, then keeping your bicycle stashed away in your storage cupboard will do the trick. Storing your bicycle away in your storage cupboard frees up your space, without ruining the aesthetics of your apartment. If you’re planning on ditching your cycle <a href="https://www.welovecycling.com/wide/2019/11/01/how-to-store-the-bike-away-for-the-winter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the season</a>, this is the ideal way to store your cycle for the upcoming months.</p>



<p>Tuck your bike behind your coat to ensure that it is well out of sight. Placing it flush along the wall of your cupboard ensures it does not take up too much space. There is no special equipment needed for this method, and it is usually fairly easy to take your bike out when you think it is time to ride it again.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hiding in Plain Sight: Make it a Part of Your Décor!</h2>



<p>Apart from using bike wall mounts, you can also include your bike in any room as a part of the décor. For this, you can either add bike racks which can hold multiple bikes, or simply arrange it in any space to make it look more filled out. Coordinate the colors in the room to match your bike and make it seem cohesive. Now, no one will be able to tell that it wasn’t meant to be there in the first place!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Peek-a-boo: Tuck it Behind Furniture</h2>



<p>Have a long sofa or a couch that takes up a lot of space? Well, if it is big enough you can simply tuck your bike behind the furniture to store it there. It is a simple and convenient way to store a bike in an apartment at no extra cost. If you don’t think bike racks for your small apartment are worth the investment, hiding it behind furniture may be the best choice for you. Your guests wouldn’t spot it, and you won’t have to worry about arranging extra space for your bike.</p>



<p>If your apartment has a laundry room, you can also tuck your bike between your washer and dryer to keep it out of the way. This is an age old, tried and tested method, that is inexpensive but effective.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Bike Under the Stairs: Create a Nook for It</h2>



<p>If you love to bike and do it frequently enough, you will have some equipment to go along with it as well. Why not opt for a bike dock in your apartment? Bike docks are user-friendly and easy to install below your stairs. With these docks, you can create a nook for your bike and store your gear neatly in one place. For those who have <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cycling-accessories/">a lot of biking equipment</a> which cannot be hidden away easily, getting a dock is a great choice. If you are renting your apartment, ensure that you check in with your landlord, or your lease to ensure that you can store your bike below your stairs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Outside Your Home: Store It in Your Balcony or Porch</h2>



<p>If you have a balcony or a porch, you can easily store your bike there. Although you may need to check with your landlord if you’re renting; keeping your bike right outside your home ensures that it is safe and out of the way. It is easy to take your bike in and out when it is in your balcony, and ensures that you do not have to sacrifice any storage space!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So, you’ve done all the difficult parts of moving. You’ve found an <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/bad-credit-when-finding-an-apartment-in-nyc-heres-help/">apartment</a> to match your budget, signed a lease, got renter’s insurance. Now it’s time for the fun stuff- decorating the space! So what if your apartment is tiny? Getting to decorate your own place is one of the most exciting things ever! Now, your place can be a reflection of your personality and taste alone! No more posters of movies that you haven’t watched. No more of that ugly chair of your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-ways-to-refresh-home-decor-in-a-shared-apartment-roomi/">roommate’s</a> that clashed with your table. Now YOU get to decide everything! But deciding on the interior decor of a small apartment is tough. You want the place to feel like you, but it’s also incredibly easy to overdo a tiny space. Which is why Roomi has got amazing apartment hacks for your small rental apartment! These hacks will completely transform your space, trust us!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of the best apartment hacks for a tiny apartment: buy only multifunctional furniture</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re living in a small apartment, functionality is key. Yes, an exotic statement furniture piece looks lovely, but it’s also taking up a lot of space that could be used for more practical things. For instance, a sofa-cum-bed is one of the best hacks for a small rental apartment. Not only will you have sleeping space for when guests stay over, you get a kickass couch as well! Honestly, <a href="https://www.ikea.com/">Ikea</a> will be your best friend when trying to find multifunctional furniture. That store is just full of amazing apartment hacks!</p>



<p>But you don’t always have to sacrifice aesthetics for functionality. You can have both! Look at this amazing vintage trunk that doubles as a coffee table! It’s both beautiful to look at while also providing storage space!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of Roomi’s favorite apartment hacks: portable home bar</h2>



<p>Having your friends over for drinks and dinner is one of the most fun parts of having an apartment. But investing in a bar is often unnecessary and expensive. And leaving out half-empty bottles of booze just doesn’t look good. So, what do you do? Well, let us introduce to you one of our favorite small rental apartment hacks- portable home bars! These home bars take up very little space and look amazing! You can even scour local thrift stores to find a trolley and convert it into your very own home bar! I mean just look at this one, isn’t it just fantastic?! Now you can get a party started without much hassle!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Store stuff under your furniture</h2>



<p>Honestly, an apartment with adequate <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/7-storage-hacks-that-will-transform-your-home-roomi/">storage</a> space might actually be a myth at this point. So, you can imagine it’s even harder for people with small apartments. So, what do you do? Well, for starters, you buy furniture that has <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/best-storage-beds">space</a> underneath. Ottoman bed frames are one of the best apartment hacks for you. Not only do they look great, you also get storage along with it. You should also invest in these beautiful <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hosroome-Handmade-Storage-Decorative-Organizing/dp/B07MYS6YD9">wicker baskets</a>! It’s one of the best hacks for a small rental apartment because they make <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-organize-your-space-while-coliving-in-nyc/">organizing</a> your stuff so easy without compromising on aesthetics!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Invest in a round dining table</h2>



<p>Once you’re an adult, eating dinner in your bed just loses its appeal. I mean, it just feels more adult to have your meals on a dinner table. But if you’re living in a small space, large dining tables are just not feasible. But that doesn’t mean you can’t still eat like an adult. Just buy a round dining table. Not only are they so chic, they’re also one of the greatest space-saving apartment hacks!</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/784541197582432471/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/784541197582432471/</a>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get overhead lights</h2>



<p>When you’re choosing the decor for a small apartment, it’s important to not crowd the floors. And it is ridiculously easy to crowd a small apartment. Four pieces of furniture and boom! There’s no more space left to walk. So, how do you make your space beautiful without everything feeling too overstuffed? Well, overhead lights are the most beautiful hacks for a small rental apartment. The more your space is lit up, the more spacious it will feel. Not to mention, hanging lamps are some of the most gorgeous pieces of decor on this planet. I mean, just look at how these hanging lights completely transform the space!</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/652107221039421400/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/652107221039421400/</a>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get creative!</h2>



<p>Look, at the end of the day, only you know your space the best. So, get creative! Take all those weird nooks and crannies of your apartment and turn them into beautiful corners. That’s what will make your space unique and feel like home! Just remember to stay calm and enjoy the process, you’ll miss it when it’s over!</p>

<p>No one can prepare you for the feeling of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/a-foolproof-guide-to-adopting-a-dog-with-your-roomi-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopting</a> your first pet. It’s a magical moment! The moment you realize there’s no one else who will love you as unconditionally as your pet will. It’s one of the purest bonds to exist and in our opinion, everyone should experience it at least once! But a pet also means you’ll have to make several changes to your lifestyle. So, today we thought we’d discuss one such major change that you’ll have to make for the new pet in your life. But don’t worry, it’s the fun kinda change where you get to go shopping! Yes, we’re talking about making the decor of your Los Angeles apartment <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-hacks-to-make-your-apartment-dog-friendly-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pet friendly</a>. Doesn’t matter if it’s a quintessential tiny Los Angeles apartment or one of those rare big apartments, there is a pet-friendly apartment hack in here for you! So, let’s begin!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get good quality pet gates to make your Los Angeles apartment pet friendly</h2>



<p>Yes, we know, pet gates aren’t known to be the most beautiful addition to your decor, especially if it’s a small apartment. But trust us, you’re going to need it. Because as much as you adore your pet, sometimes giving them full access to your house can cause trouble. But you don’t have to buy pet gates that are ugly and ruin your vibe. There’s plenty of great (re: beautiful) options out there! For example, check out <a href="https://petprojectla.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Pet Project LA</a> for some really cool stuff to make your Los Angeles apartment pet friendly without compromising on your aesthetic. Try to look for gates that match the color scheme of your home, so that they become a part of your decor (now, that’s a good apartment hack!). Who said pet friendly apartments have to be an eye-sore!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A designated feeding station to make your Los Angeles apartment pet friendly</h2>



<p>Now, this is the part where you get to be creative! A feeding station is obviously a necessary part of owning a pet. But most people don’t give it much thought and that’s such a mistake! This is a great opportunity to really make your Los Angeles Apartment pet friendly <em>and</em> beautiful! I mean, just look at this kitchen island with the in-built dog dishes!</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/68736134221/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/68736134221/</a>



<p>Of course, this is an example of one of those fancy pet-friendly apartments. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have fun with the decor of your small apartment! The only apartment hack here is that there is no hack! Go as wild as you want! (Or as basic as you want, no judgement!).</p>

Here is a Foolproof Guide!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Make use of the mudroom</strong></h2>



<p>Very few apartments have features that are pet friendly by default but a mudroom is one of them. If you happen to live in an apartment in Los Angeles that has a mudroom, then your home is already pet friendly! You just need to make some modifications! Set up a little clean-up station in your mudroom and call it a day. But if you happen to live in a small apartment that doesn’t have a mudroom, don’t worry, we’ve got decor solutions for you too! Just make some space near your door that will act as a clean up station. But remember any furniture you put around there should be stain-resistant! Another great apartment hack is to tile the area so that it’s easier to clean up the splatters! Here’s a gorgeous example of a DIY mudroom!</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/140806228626747/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/140806228626747/</a>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Furniture, fabric and fashion!</h2>



<p>So, as you might already know, having pets can be quite stressful for your belongings… Of course you’ll train your pets and they’ll learn how to behave in-doors, but accidents will happen. Quite frequently. Making the decor of your small Los Angeles apartment pet friendly is actually not that difficult. It’s just about being careful about what you buy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So, what do you do?</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Well, for starters, invest in fabric that is stain-resistant. That means all your furniture, curtains, table cloths will have to be made from material that can sustain <em>accidents</em>. That’s what pet friendly apartments are all about.</li><li>We actually have a fantastic apartment hack for you here: try and pick a color scheme that matches your pet&#8217;s fur. That way, when they shed, it won’t be so obvious on your furniture.</li><li>Avoid furniture that your pet can chew on. Instead go for metal or leather.</li><li>Invest in <a href="https://www.residentialproductsonline.com/most-stain-resistant-washable-matte-paint-market" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">washable paint</a>, <em>trust us on this</em>.</li><li>A colorful <a href="https://www.woven.is/">rug</a> will hide many secrets and accidents.</li><li>Since most household plants are <a href="https://www.ccspca.com/blog-spca/education/poisonous-plants-for-dogs/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">poisonous</a> for dogs, don’t keep those on ground level.</li></ul>

	</div>
	


<p>In the end, making your home decor more pet friendly is a way to show to your pet that they’re a part of your family. So, take a deep breath and do what feels right for you and your pet. You’ve got this!</p>

<p>A brightly lit living room that is decorated with reflective surfaces and mirrors that leave small specks of dispersed sunlight rainbows across the room isn&#8217;t just the perfect decor for the living room — it&#8217;s also a sure shot way to keeping your spirits high throughout the day.</p>



<p>In big cities where finding an apartment of your choice is anyway a task of the highest order, we recommend keeping one requirement consistent throughout your search — <strong>natural light.</strong></p>



<p>Having spent most of the past year indoors, natural light has now become more important than ever. And this is not just for pictures that go on the gram. But for the essential nourishment that our minds and bodies get from natural light.</p>



<p>Feel like it&#8217;s finally time for you to move to a new city? <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-signs-youre-ready-to-move-to-a-new-city-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here are 6 signs that show you&#8217;re ready to move to a new city, even amid the pandemic.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why direct natural light you ask?</h2>



<p>In big cities like New York, where finding an apartment you like is one of the biggest tasks you&#8217;ll go through in your 20s, finding one that fits into your budget will probably end up feeling like a complete blessing.</p>



<p>Sure you&#8217;ll make some compromises to find an apartment that fits your budget. But we would recommend getting a place that has some form of direct sunlight or other. Why?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Direct natural sunlight increases focus and productivity. It has also been proven great for decreasing anxiety and increasing immunity!</h3>

The light simply improves the communication between the regions of the brain that are central to our handling of emotions such as stress and anxiety,” says <a href="https://sciencenordic.com/denmark-sleep-disturbance-stress/morning-light-relieves-anxiety/1397274">Ph.D. fellow Brenda Mc Mahon, MD, of the Neurobiology Research Unit at the Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark.</a></p></blockquote>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Natural light also plays an integral role in keeping our immunity, eyesight, and moods in check. Since it is a natural source of vitamin D, it <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/basics/definition/con-20021047">acts as the fool-proof cure to seasonal affective disorder</a> too!</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do I work with natural light to amplify my apartment decor?</h2>



<p>In bigger cities like New York, where coming across any apartment at all is a big task, we recommend all our readers to not be dissuaded by the lack of big windows, or the absence of a killer view.</p>



<p>These things might seem like a drawback in the beginning and you&#8217;d probably feel like you are settling for <em>less</em>, but a smaller window, with limited potential of what one may refer to as a &#8220;killer view&#8221;, isn&#8217;t the worst thing your apartment could have.</p>



<p>Moreover, we&#8217;ve got some pretty easy apartment hacks — that can make even the smallest windows in your apartment act like the best decor ever!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Start by furnishing with light colours.</h3>



<p>Pick a lighter color as often as you can. Making this philosophy the basis of your apartment decor will result in a brighter space, even before the sunlight hits in. Whiter and lighter shades naturally reflect light, and darker shades do the exact opposite.</p>



<p>Pay special attention to your floor, as it receives the most amount of sunlight. This includes the rugs too!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Make decluttering your mantra, as well as the staple piece in your apartment decor.</h3>



<p>Whether your apartment has one small window or 10 large ones, it&#8217;s best to keep this place clear and without any obstruction to allow ample light to pass through. This is by far the easiest way to maximize light in your room. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/caring-for-your-indoor-plants-in-6-simple-tips-roomi/">It is also (one of) the best possible things you can do for the indoor plants you might be interested in keeping!</a></p>



<p>Oh and also, regular cleaning of your window area means you are ensuring that the source, as well as the path of light, remains clean.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Use the following strategies for reflective and non reflective items:</h3>



<p>When it comes to window treatments like blinds and stains, we recommend treating them as lightly as possible.</p>



<p>Ditch the blinds and opt for lighter shades for your curtains. This is especially important if your ultimate goal is to use natural light as an apartment decor piece. Bonus? You wouldn&#8217;t have to switch your lights on!</p>



<p>Some of us may be giving up on some much-desired privacy if we keep all our windows open all day. A better option for those of us would be to opt for lighter blinds. These don&#8217;t completely restrict light from entering your apartment. And get their job done! Also, slivers of light penetrating through lighter blinds look pretty darn cool.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A. <strong>THE LESS SHADOW AN ITEM CREATES THE BETTER</strong></h4>



<p>Using reflective objects like glass for cabinet doors, vases, and shelves are one of the simplest ways to create an airy atmosphere for your apartment. You can also dress these pieces up or down, depending on the season or festival!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">B. <strong>MAXIMISE NATURAL LIGHT BY PLACING MIRRORS AND REFLECTIVE ITEMS ON THE EAST-WEST AREAS.</strong></h4>



<p>We recommend doing this as the sun focuses on each of your east and west walls for half the day.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">C. <strong>TRACK WHERE BEAMS OF LIGHT HIT AND ADD REFLECTIVE PIECES THERE.</strong></h4>



<p>This one&#8217;s quite simple. You&#8217;re the new mayor of Natural Light City. ?</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s a certain room of your apartment that you never need to close the door of, consider removing the door completely. </p>



<p>Or! Replace your pre-existing doors with French doors that can be opened completely, letting in ample amounts of light during the day, across all rooms!</p>
