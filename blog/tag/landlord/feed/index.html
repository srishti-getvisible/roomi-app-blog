<p>Every landlord has good things to say about their property. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/a-first-time-renters-brilliant-guide-to-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you&#8217;re new to renting</a>, you might find it challenging to navigate through the criteria by which an apartment becomes desirable. With open queries (like what&#8217;s your late-fee policy? How is the water pressure? Can I sublet?) you can get to know more about the property and the landlord&#8217;s expectations. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a list of 20 questions compiled by Roomi that will help you gain more perspective on whether or not you should rent that gorgeous space you&#8217;ve been eying.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="8384" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/attachment/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Number to call so you can ask questions to your landlord before renting" class="wp-image-8384" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/call-number-to-ask-questions-before-renting.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. When is the apartment available?</h2>



<p>Match your move-in date with the landlord&#8217;s start date. It&#8217;s challenging to find an apartment that ticks all the boxes, so if the move-in date does not match yours, see if you can have a conversation with your potential landlord to find a solution you&#8217;re both happy with.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Is there a rental deposit?</h2>



<p>Despite some state laws prohibiting the practice, many landlords go for non-refundable deposits and have them printed in the lease. It&#8217;s best to do your research and check the agreement thoroughly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. What is the lease duration?</h2>



<p>If the landlord wants a lease for two years and can only commit one year, no matter how perfect the apartment is, you need to move on and check other places. You do have an option of subletting – but consent from your landlord is essential here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. How is the water pressure?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s important to check all taps in the kitchen and bathroom. Ask the landlord about the shower pressure and how long it takes for water to heat in the morning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. What are the amenities?</h2>



<p>This is one of the most important questions to ask before renting. Check if all amenities are in working condition, and document the &#8216;before&#8217; pictures of all the appliances provided. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-apartment-features-check-signing-lease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If there&#8217;s a gym or a pool in your apartment building</a>, check for timings and the policy on guest usage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. What is the room&#8217;s heating situation?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to check whether you have control over your room&#8217;s temperature regulation. Often, your landlord has the back-end control of the temperature. So, make sure you ask them if it&#8217;s possible for you to regulate the temperature.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. How is cell reception?</h2>



<p>Can you imagine yourself leaning out of your window trying to get a cell network or scurrying into a corner of the room for a better signal? And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a good idea to check for phone reception in your potential apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Who accepts the deliveries to the property?</h2>



<p>You may want all your parcels or UPS or FedEx deliveries taken by a supervisor or authorized person in the absence of a doorman. Ask if these options are available.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Is it noisy?</h2>



<p>Noise can be disruptive, especially if you are going to be working from home. Whether it&#8217;s<a href="https://noisefree.org/how-to-complain-about-apartment-noise-successfully/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> noisy neighbors</a>, loud music, or TV, it affects the quality of your lifestyle. Some landlords have a &#8216;quiet hour policy&#8217; included in the housing agreement. Check with your potential landlord if noise is something that could bother you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Who is responsible for managing common areas?</h2>



<p>Some landlords take the responsibility upon themselves to maintain common areas like the hallway, elevator, and porch. It is also common for some landlords to charge an annual or monthly maintenance fee. It&#8217;s best to know some of your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/five-common-questions-about-renters-rights-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rights as a renter</a> in your state to clarify this one, so ask the right questions to your landlord.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">11. What is the guest policy?</h2>



<p>In many areas, the landlord or the building manager needs to be informed if you&#8217;re having a long-term guest or visitor coming over. Do ask your landlord beforehand if you plan on having a guest over for more than a week to avoid sneaking around.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">12. Is there parking available?</h2>



<p>High-density areas have permit and license requirements for parking. With tightly cramped apartment blocks, it may be a challenge to park your car if you drive one. Ask your landlord if there&#8217;s a parking spot reserved for the building residents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">13. Are pets allowed?</h2>



<p>A necessary question before renting! If you own a pet, it is a good idea to check for pet policy with your landlord to avoid unnecessary fines later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">14. Can you sublet?</h2>



<p>What happens if your work requires you to travel for a few months, or what if you&#8217;re going away for a long trip? <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/is-it-legal-sublet-room-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subletting will help you pay rent for the months</a> where you&#8217;re personally not using the space. A fair request from the landlord&#8217;s end might be to adhere to his guidelines and meet his screening criteria, which seems like a fair deal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">15. What is the late-fee policy?</h2>



<p>Check with the landlord on the late-fee policy. Every state allows late fees within their guideline and state limit. It&#8217;s best to do your research on the late-fees policy to avoid paying a higher late fee.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">16. Mode of paying rent</h2>



<p>What methods for rental payments will the landlord accept? Online payment is an easy and convenient option. Also, avoid landlords who only insist on cash payments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">17. Termination</h2>



<p>Another important question to ask before renting! Does your landlord allow early lease termination? Some landlords may provide early termination of the lease, but might ask you to pay a fee for the months you signed up. Get clarity on this if you have uncertain plans for your stay in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">18. Lease renewal</h2>



<p>Can the lease be renewed? What if you want to go month-to-month after your lease expires? It helps to know the landlord’s perspective on this as some plan to sell the property, and you may not know their intention unless you ask them this question.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">19. Which furnishings or appliances are part of the rental lease?</h2>



<p>As a practice, some states require the renters to install their own devices, while in many others, the landlord installs them. For the latter, it might be a good idea to check the working condition of the appliances. You might also need to ask for an upgrade if required.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">20. Neighborhood safety</h2>



<p>Has there been a break-in, theft, or assault on this property? You may not get a direct answer to this question, but at least the landlord knows that you take safety seriously. You can check police or public records for accurate answers if you need to. It might not seem like it, but this is one of the most important questions to ask your landlord for your own safety.</p>

<p>Know your rights, tenants! So we&#8217;ve made a guide that provides answers to the five most common questions about renters&#8217; rights. This will include questions like &#8216;Can I deny entry to my landlord?&#8217; &#8216;Who is responsible for maintenance of common areas in my apartment?&#8217; and more! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are Renters&#8217; Rights?</h2>



<p>That is to say, renters&#8217; rights, they are local laws that govern your living space. It gives the tenants a legal recourse if the landlord fails to maintain their property.</p>



<p>So some common questions about renters&#8217; rights we&#8217;ll be covering are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Can I deny entry to my landlord?</li><li>What to do if your landlord won&#8217;t fix anything in your apartment?</li><li>Can a landlord kick you out?</li><li>Who is accountable for the maintenance of common areas in my apartment building?</li><li>Is my landlord harassing me?</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Common question about renters&#8217; rights: Can I deny entry to my landlord?</h2>



<p>To answer one of the most common questions about renters&#8217; rights: Yes, a tenant can deny entry to a landlord based on <a href="https://www.justia.com/real-estate/landlord-tenant/information-for-tenants/tenants-right-to-privacy/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">their right to&nbsp;privacy.</a></p>



<p>For common repairs and house improvements or to show the apartment to a prospective tenant or purchaser, the landlord needs to give the tenant a 24-hour notice period and arrive at a reasonable time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are there any exceptions?</h3>



<p>If an emergency strikes that requires the landlord to be present, e.g. if a tenant has abandoned the property or there&#8217;s a police investigation for a reported crime, the landlord has the right to enter the property. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Common question about renters&#8217; rights: Can my landlord refuse to fix anything in my apartment?</h2>



<p>A tenant has a fundamental right to a comfortable home, regardless of what&#8217;s written in your lease! So to answer a common question about renters&#8217; rights: The landlord must <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-deal-with-apartment-damages-before-moving-out/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintain your unit during your tenancy. </a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So what should I do if my landlord does refuse?</h3>



<p>Additionally, the tenant has a lot of options available if the landlord is refusing to make major repairs. Options include alerting a housing inspector if the problem violates building code.</p>



<p>In many states you can withhold your rent until repairs are made. As a tenant, you can also deduct the cost from your monthly rent with consent from the landlord. Moreover, you can even go to the small claims court and sue your landlord; you may be able to get your rent reduced.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Who is accountable for the maintenance of common areas in my apartment building?</h2>



<p>To answer this common question about renters&#8217; rights: Landlords are responsible for maintaining common areas as mandated by state law. When you talk about maintenance of common areas in your apartment, it implies that cleanliness and safety are taken care of. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What if my landlord isn&#8217;t complying?</h3>



<p>However, if your landlord is not addressing these issues or is unresponsive, you can get assistance by contacting the local government office based on the violation of health codes, safety codes and/or failing to maintain housing standards.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Common question about renters&#8217; rights: Can my landlord kick me out?</h2>



<p>To answer this common question about renters&#8217; rights: It is illegal for the landlord to change the locks or throw out your belongings. A landlord cannot just kick you out. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can I get help if my landlord tries to kick me out?</h3>



<p>Additionally, they need to follow a formal process of eviction that the state provides. You can sue the landlord if they force you out of the apartment. You can also get compensation for damage to your belongings and other related losses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="769" data-attachment-id="8678" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/five-common-questions-about-renters-rights-roomi/attachment/deny-entry-to-my-landlord/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/deny-entry-to-my-landlord.jpg?fit=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,769" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="deny-entry-to-my-landlord" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/deny-entry-to-my-landlord.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/deny-entry-to-my-landlord.jpg?fit=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/deny-entry-to-my-landlord.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&#038;ssl=1" alt="Common questions about renters' rights: Can i deny entry to my landlord?" class="wp-image-8678" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/deny-entry-to-my-landlord.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/deny-entry-to-my-landlord.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/deny-entry-to-my-landlord.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. How do I approach the problem of my landlord harassing me?</h2>



<p>Harassment from landlords can be quite a nerve-wracking experience. It can lead to worrying about your mental health and safety. And obvious forms of harassment include violating your right to privacy by showing up unannounced or at odd hours. Harassment also includes spreading false information and defamation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So when should I inform the authorities?</h3>



<p>To answer this common question about renters&#8217; rights: A landlord cannot disrupt your work environment by spreading false information about you to your co-workers or employers. Some landlords even break the law by spying, assaulting, or sexually assaulting their tenants. If you have experienced this extreme form of harassment, you should get the police involved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You’ve probably heard plenty of roommate horror stories, but the truth is that roommates aren’t always the ones you should be weary of. For some unlucky renters, it’s bad landlords that can make your life a living nightmare. Especially if your landlord changed the locks! So if you&#8217;re wondering &#8216;Can a landlord change the locks?,&#8217; you&#8217;ve come to the right place. Let&#8217;s decipher all about if a landlord decides to lock you out. </p>



<p>Of course, not every landlord will lock you out or is a bad guy. But to be a smart renter, you have to to do your research. Whether it’s asking for a rent receipt, making sure you have hot water, or fighting back a “shortcut” eviction, knowing your renters rights can ultimately protect you from a scheming landlord wanting to lock you out. So what are your rights if your landlord changed locks? You might think your landlord can lock you out, but here’s what you should know about illegal evictions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Expedited evictions or if your landlord locks you out, it is illegal (almost all the&nbsp;time)</h2>



<p>Generally&nbsp;landlords know that bypassing legal eviction procedures could result in far more trouble (and fines) than is worth the risk, so most won’t take drastic measures to kick you out. But on the off chance that your landlord changed the locks while you’re at work, you can fight back. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">First you should know that your landlord cannot legally force you to leave by:</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Changing the locks</li><li>Turning off the utilities</li><li>Removing a tenant’s&nbsp;belongings</li><li>Verbally threatening legal action but never producing legal documents</li><li>Verbally threatening physical harm</li></ol>



<p>These rules apply in <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/lock-out-tenant-illegal-29799.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtually every state</a>&nbsp;because a landlord/tenant relationship is a legal one, not a personal one. Just like signing a lease, evicting someone&nbsp;is a legal process, and is thus carried out through legal documents. Bottom line: If there’s no paperwork, your &#8216;landlord lock you out&#8217; scheme isn&#8217;t legal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How important is the law in cases like these?</h4>



<p>Here’s an example of how important legal intervention is in the eviction process. “Squatting” or adverse possession, is a process by which a tenant (whether or not he/she is a leaseholder) may receive the title to someone else’s property without the owner’s consent through prolonged, undisputed and obvious occupation. In New York, the occupant must live on the premises for an uninterrupted 10 years for this to happen.</p>



<p>If a squatter can prove they’ve maintained residence on a property for 30 days, they’re legally allowed to stay there until the true property owner goes through the extensive process of legally evicting them. So you find a strange man in your house after a month? You can’t just kick him out. (Sounds crazy, but it’s <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-landlord-remove-stranger-house-article-1.2066839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actually happened</a>.) If 10 years pass without legal action, the squatter becomes the sole proprietor of the property. The same rules <a href="http://homeguides.sfgate.com/squatters-rights-law-california-45887.html" class="broken_link">apply in San Francisco</a>, except the requirement for the length of occupancy is less stringent than in New York, requiring only a period of five years before the squatter becomes the owner of the property.</p>



<p>These laws just go to show that eviction is&nbsp;<em>not</em> that easy, even in the most bizarre scenarios. Check your city’s housing authority site to know exactly what the eviction process entails. So to answer your question about whether or not can a landlord change the locks, the brief answer is no. Not without the process in place at least. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is it ever legal for my landlord to lock me out?</h2>



<p>They aren’t. A truly legal eviction takes time. Your landlord can lock you for a breach of contract or for going against the agreements set out in your lease, but it’s a lengthy, highly litigated process. In New York, for instance, a to lock you out, the landlord will have to go to court to get&nbsp;a “Warrant of Eviction” even if you owe rent or your lease has ended. And it’s still not that easy to get one. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">First your landlord has&nbsp;to prove that you, the tenant:</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Have not paid rent</li><li>Have very obviously broken your lease terms</li><li>Don’t have an active lease&nbsp;and were given a 30-day warning</li></ol>



<p>In any of these cases, the landlord still has&nbsp;to give you 30 days to move out. So your landlord cannot lock you out, change the locks or turn off your utilities without notice.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Okay, so what are some laws a tenant should know about? </h2>



<p>San Francisco recently passed the&nbsp;Eviction Protections 2.0&nbsp;bill in an effort to put a stop to sham evictions that have seen a rise in recent years as rent prices have skyrocketed. Where once a landlord could claim an unattended bike in the hallway was grounds for eviction (even in this case the landlord would be required to give the tenant a reasonable amount of time to move), E.P. 2.0 ensures a tenant is given ample time to fix a problem before an immediate eviction notice.</p>



<p>The bill addresses other previous “grounds” for eviction, such as adding new protections for roommates, and tenants who cannot respond to legal documents because they’re written in a language they can’t read. There is also less incentive to attempt a sham eviction, as the new law sets rent limitations on potentially suspicious evictions, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellis Act</a> owner move-ins. In the event&nbsp;of a&nbsp;no-fault eviction, the landlord can’t raise the rent for five years, hopefully discouraging them from issuing&nbsp;evictions simply to raise the rent for future tenants.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why do shortcut evictions still happen then?</h2>



<p>So why do shortcut evictions still happen with a landlord changing the locks? Unfortunately, not all landlords and property owners are shaking in their boots at the thought of legal action because they rely on tenants’ inaction. In order to fight back, a&nbsp;tenant has to go to court to dispute the situation. Some tenants choose not to act because they fear legal fees. More often than not, the tenant simply feels intimidated or lacks knowledge of their local renters rights. They assume that it&#8217;s legal if a landlord changed the locks, removed belongings, or shut off utilities. Especially if you’re at fault, or have been in the past, for something&nbsp;like missing a payment or breaking the lease for some other reason, you might assume the landlord is within his or her rights.</p>



<p>Journalist Becky Blanton, who spoke on this matter during a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/becky_blanton_the_year_i_was_homeless?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TED Talk</a> in 2009, encourages tenants to realize that words aren’t as powerful as paper in the rental business.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Short term evictions <em>do</em>&nbsp;work if the tenant doesn’t know their rights, can’t afford an attorney, or won’t fight back,” she says. “Landlords count on this when they do it.</p><p>“But if you’re faced with a threat of a lawsuit, find an attorney or at the least do some research&nbsp;to learn what your rights are.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Blanton points out that apart from changing the locks, landlords will also threaten legal action. So they can get a tenant to flee the scene. But again, without paperwork, it’s not legal. So if a landlord changed locks and wants you to move out, it&#8217;s definitely illegal. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How should one fight back a landlord lock out?</h2>



<p>Dr. Jonathan Farley was living in Massachusetts when he ran into a situation with a landlady who had some very strict rules about who she would rent to. According to Dr. Farley, who was working as a professor at MIT at the time, she would only rent to academics, would not allow couples, and didn’t want children in the apartment even to visit. But while landlords can refuse to rent to a tenant for not meeting certain qualifications, they cannot set their own rules for eviction. Simply put, a landlord cannot lock you out on their own terms. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“She said that a tenant who had lived in the building for five years wouldn’t be allowed to stay because he just got married.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Dr. Farley also found her in his apartment without due notice or permission several times. A colleague warned him that the landlady might disappear around important deadlines. All to avoid updating legal documents or allowing for changes. “And the landlady was indeed unavailable until after the deadline,” he says. This forced him to pay rent for months summer where he worked overseas at Oxford University.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Alas, my brother (a lawyer) advised that I pay the rent anyway and try to get the money back later. I sued and won, but the judge only gave me $1,000 and I had paid more than that.”</p></blockquote>
