										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving to Houston is a great idea for many reasons. It is one of the most affordable cities in the country. It has a booming job market. It has an extremely diverse population. It is one of the top three food cities in the country. It is also home to the biggest medical center in the world. We could go on and on, but the list is never ending. So, if you’re stuck wondering whether or not to make the move, don’t. Instead ask yourself, when you should move. Because there are very few cities that are as great as Houston. And, when you do decide to move, we’re going to be here to help you find great rooms for rent in Houston, Texas. But before we get to that, let’s learn a little more about the city!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to Know Houston</h2>



<p>Houston is home to NASA’s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center due to which it’s officially known as the Space City. But that’s not all, over time the city has accumulated many nicknames, including the Bayou City, Magnolia City, Hustle Town and The Big Heart. If that doesn’t tell you how awesome and versatile this place is, we don’t know what will. One of the most diverse cities in the country, more than a whopping 145 languages are spoken here.</p>



<p>But beware of the weather here, it tends to be hot and humid. In fact, you probably won’t need a winter wardrobe at all.The temperature barely ever drops below the 60s, even in peak winters. All you need is a cute coat and you’re prepared to face the winters.</p>



<p>But despite the humidity, Houston is a great city to live in. The housing market is one of the most affordable in Texas, so finding cheap rooms for rent in Houston is easy. It is also the largest city in Texas and attracts tens of thousands of new residents every year. With a booming job market, some of the best food in the country and a relatively low cost of living, Houston is a great option for all. But carry a lot of insect repellent.</p>

<p>So, let’s take a look at some of the top neighborhoods in Houston.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top Neighborhoods in Houston</h2>



<p><strong>The Woodlands</strong>: The Woodlands is a master-planned community in the North of Houston. It consistently ranks as one of the best neighborhoods to live in, not just in Houston but in the rest of the country as well. While generally considered an expensive area, finding reasonably priced rooms for rent in this part of Houston, Texas shouldn’t be too hard.</p>



<p><strong>Montrose</strong>: This is the artistic and cultural soul of Houston. Filled with amazing bohemian cafes, theatres and art galleries, Montrose has also been a historically LGBT-friendly neighborhood. The rental market here is also super affordable, so finding good rooms for rent here is easy.</p>



<p><strong>River Oaks</strong>: No list about Houston neighborhoods is complete without mentioning River Oaks. Filled with historic mansions, just being in River Oaks will make you feel like royalty. While most people can’t afford to live here (the average home value here is over $2 million), it’s one of the most culturally and historically significant neighborhoods of Houston. Both the iconic River Oaks District and the River Oaks Theatre are here. We strongly recommend exploring this neighborhood at least once, even if you can’t afford to look at rooms for rent in this part of Houston.</p>
