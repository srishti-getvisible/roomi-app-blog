<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winters in New York- NYC winter essentials</h2>



<p>You have to be very particular about your wardrobe if you’re spending the winters in New York. Cutesy stuff won’t cut it- you have to go into full survival mode. But worry not, we&#8217;ve gone through the trouble of making a list of NYC winter essentials. Here are the things that you will absolutely need to survive the New York winters-</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">NYC winter essentials#1 Puffer Jacket</h3>



<p>Like any good survival guide, this one also begins with a sturdy jacket. Yes, I know, a puffer jacket isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. But trust me, you’re going to need it in New York. It is an absolute NYC winter essential. There are a few things to keep in mind when you’re shopping for one-</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>It needs to be <strong>windproof</strong>. The thing about winters in New York is that it’s not just the temperature that hurts you, it’s the wind speed. In fact, the wind speed might actually be worse. So be extra careful about only buying one that is windproof.</li>



<li>Your jacket should have a <strong>hood</strong>. Yes, this hood will go on top of a different cap that you will also need to wear. Believe me, New York is not messing around.</li>



<li>Make sure your jacket is also <strong>waterproof</strong> because what’s the point of going through all this trouble if you’re just going to end up drenched from all the snow.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you take away only one thing from this survival guide, let it be this- buy a good puffer jacket, even if it means spending a little bit more money than you normally would.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Roomi Tip</strong>- it’s better to buy a puffer jacket that goes down to your thighs, kinda like a coat. You’d be surprised at how much that helps battle the winter.</pre>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sweaters, Sweaters, and Sweaters</h3>



<p>Don’t we all love sweaters? It’s the perfect piece of clothing- both cute on the outside and comfy on the inside. You do have some leeway here to go for cute stuff, but again, it’s function over fashion. Survival mode, remember? If you’re buying woolen sweaters, try to get a high percentage of wool. If you can get one that’s 100% wool, nothing like it, New York winter won’t be able to touch you. You can also buy cashmere sweaters, which are more insular than wool but are also more expensive.</p>



<p><strong>Special Mention</strong>&#8211; <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.uniqlo.com/in/product/men/innerwear/heattech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniqlo’s Heattech line is pretty damn good</a>. This survival guide would not be complete without mentioning Heattech, it’s like they’re made for surviving winters in New York. And as a plus point, they look pretty damn good at a very affordable price. So, get your New Yorker self to the nearest Uniqlo and pick yourself some new stuff.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.uniqlo.com/sg/corp/pressrelease/Heattech%202.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="survive winters in New York"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Credit: <a href="http://uniqlo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniqlo.com</a></figcaption></figure>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">NYC winter essentials#2 Snow Boots</h3>



<p>Now for the more fashionable part of the survival guide- boots. But no, your cute little Chelsea boots won’t survive the harsh winters in New York. Better keep them in the closet for next fall. What you need now are snow boots. Yes, kinda like the ones you see Eskimos wear. This is the second NYC winter essential. Here are some things you should keep in mind before purchasing your very first snow boots!</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Buy your snow boots at the start of winter. You know, how when you put off your Christmas shopping till the very last second but by then all the good stuff is already sold out? Yeah, that happens with snow boots as well. Finding good snow boots during winters in New York after it’s already started snowing is like trying to find the lost city of Atlantis. So, <strong>plan ahead</strong>.</li>



<li>Don’t even try to wear any of your cute ankle-length boots out in the snow, they will die an excruciating death. Instead, buy something that at least goes up to your <strong>mid-calves</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>Roomi Tip</strong>- <a href="https://www.hunterboots.com/intl/en/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Check out Hunter for boots</a>. They’re a pretty trusted brand by most New Yorkers and will survive the entire season. If you want to go extra hard, <a href="https://www.sorel.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">then go for Sorel</a>, these will last you for a loooong time and have a very sturdy grip.</pre>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="300" height="375" data-attachment-id="6338" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/a-comprehensive-guide-to-surviving-winters-in-new-york-roomi/attachment/boots/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/boots.jpg?fit=300%2C375&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="300,375" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="boots" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/boots.jpg?fit=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/boots.jpg?fit=300%2C375&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/boots.jpg?resize=300%2C375&#038;ssl=1" alt="NYC winter essentials" class="wp-image-6338" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/boots.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/boots.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Credit: <a href="http://hunterboots.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hunterboots.com</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>While on the topic of boots, invest in some cute knee-length woolen socks. These will keep you warm and if you get cute patterned ones- they’re adorable to look at.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A few other things you’ll need to survive winters in New York-</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cute scarves</li>



<li>Cute caps</li>



<li><strong>TEXTING GLOVES (THIS IS IMPORTANT)</strong></li>

<p>Winters in New York City can be rough. It’s so cold and dark all the time that sometimes you <em>just</em> need to get away from it all. And with this year being the absolute worst, a weekend getaway is even more tempting.</p>



<p>Here are some places around NYC that you can visit for a quick weekend getaway and enjoy some much-needed change of scenery.</p>



<p>Related : <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/a-comprehensive-guide-to-surviving-winters-in-new-york-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Comprehensive Guide to Surviving Winters in New York </a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bear Mountain, NY</strong></h2>



<p>Bear Mountain is one of the easiest ways to get away from the chaos of NYC and enjoy some nature. Only an hour and fifteen minutes away from the city, it might actually take you longer to get to the airport than it would take you to get here. There’s a beautiful state park you can visit that sits on the mountains on the west bank of the Hudson. You can go for a hike and a bike ride or even have a lovely picnic with your travel companion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Foxfire Mountain House, NY</h2>



<p>Only two hours and ten minutes from NYC, the Foxfire Mountain House is magnificent. This is the perfect destination for anyone who wants a relaxing weekend getaway. This is a great place for a quiet, renovating getaway that all of us have craved all throughout this year. Just don’t forget to bring a book.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Whiteface Lodge, Lake Placid, NY</h2>



<p>Have you ever looked at pictures from Taylor Swift’s Fourth of July parties and immediately wanted to be a part of it? Yeah, same here. Well, the Whiteface Lodge is probably the closest any of will get to living out that fantasy. This retreat truly has its all- 30 acres of property filled with pools and hot tubs, a bowling alley, a movie theatre, and an 8,000-square foot spa. You can even go skiing in the Whiteface Mountains. What else could you possibly need from a getaway?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Troutbeck, NY</h2>



<p>Cottagecore enthusiasts, gather around &#8211; this one&#8217;s for you. Around a couple of hours away from NYC, this is the place where woodland fairies go down to live. It also just happens to be the place where Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway and Ralph Waldo Emerson once stayed. Surrounded by the woods, it is hard to not be artistically inspired while you’re living here. So pack up your weekend suitcase and your half-finished manuscript, and book yourself a vacation here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kennebunkport Inn, ME</h2>



<p>This one’s a little far away, but believe us, it is well worth the effort. A small town in Coastal Main, Kennebunkport has a charm like no other city. Five hours and fifteen minutes away from NYC, this resort really pulls out all the stops to celebrate the holiday season- rumor has it that you might even find a Christmas tree and holiday decorations in your <em>room</em>. Talk about joyful. And get this- to make up for how crappy 2020 has been, they are turning the hotel into a Christmas Village! We&#8217;re talking about a curling ring, igloos and private gondolas! I cannot imagine a better way to celebrate the holiday season than here with a warm cup of cocoa.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Hamptons, L.I.</h2>



<p>About three hours away from NYC, The Hamptons are a classic weekend getaway for New Yorkers. And why shouldn’t it be? It’s outright gorgeous, with its sandy beaches and untouched sceneries, this place is the haven for grumpy city dwellers. There’s something for everyone in The Hamptons- whether you want to go out drinking (you must check out Fellingham’s) or just rest on the beach, you can find something to soothe your soul. Just be sure to try the lobster rolls there. Seriously, you will not regret it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Berkshires, MA</h2>



<p>The Berkshires has a very similar vibe to The Hamptons. But what The Berkshires lack in nightlife, they make up for in pretty much everything else. About three hours away from NYC, the Berkshire has a bustling art (and theatre and dance and music) scene. The mountains add a lovely charm to this small town. You should definitely visit here at least once in your life. (Note: Shakespeare &amp; Company&#8217;s 2020 season has been suspended.)</p>
