<p>The rental application process can seem overwhelming if you&#8217;re a first-time renter. It&#8217;s nothing to be worried about! As long as you take care and follow all the steps in this guide, you&#8217;ll be able to do the rental application process without a problem.</p>



<p>With forms to fill out and documents to submit, the rental application process takes patience and a lot of effort. Here&#8217;s all you need to know about the steps and process of signing a lease.</p>

<p>Before you proceed, be sure to look up information specific to your city. These are steps that you&#8217;ll need to complete as a part of the rental application process in general.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-1-fill-out-your-rental-application"><strong>Step 1: Fill out your rental application.</strong></h3>



<p>A rental application is a form and a set of supporting documents. This includes some personal information about you like residence history, income, references, pets, and anything relevant to renting a property.</p>

<p>A rental application is used by landlords to screen potential tenants and decide who will be a good fit for the property. This process varies for each building or residence, some forms can be filled up online or collected from the landlord when you visit the place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 2: Submit the required documents.</strong></h3>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to submit certain documents as a part of the rental application process to help the landlord establish your identity and screen you.</p>



<p></p>



<p>To keep your documents organized on your Mac, it&#8217;s essential to manage them efficiently to avoid duplication and unnecessary clutter. When preparing your documents for submission, you may find duplicate files or unwanted trash that can hinder the process. Streamlining this process is key, and for those needing to organize large documents before submission, consider the ease of <a href="https://theonlineconverter.com/split-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">splitting your PDFs</a> to manage individual files.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Using <a href="https://cleanmymac.com/blog/best-free-iphone-cleaner-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone cleaners</a> can help you streamline your file management, ensuring that you only keep the necessary documents. This not only makes the application process smoother but also helps maintain a tidy and easily accessible digital workspace.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Be sure to submit all the required documents to ensure that there aren&#8217;t any hiccups in the process.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a list of things that you will need to submit as a part of your rental application:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Contact information:</strong>&nbsp;Your email ID, phone number, and address.</li>



<li><strong>Cover Letter:</strong>&nbsp;Make an impression and introduce yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Proof of Income:</strong>&nbsp;Submit proof of your employment if you&#8217;re a working professional.</li>



<li><strong>Social Security number:</strong>&nbsp;This is needed for background and credit checks.</li>



<li><strong>Documents:</strong>&nbsp;Identification cards or documents to prove your identity.</li>



<li><strong>References:</strong>&nbsp;Have a past landlord or supervisor vouch for you.</li>



<li><strong>Pets:</strong>&nbsp;Breed, size, and weight of your pet if applicable.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle information:</strong>&nbsp;The make, model, and registration of your vehicle if applicable.</li>



<li><strong>Emergency contacts</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It&#8217;s good practice to write a cover letter along with your application. Much like a job application, it lets you tell the landlord about yourself and make an impression. A cover letter also allows you to explain any issues with your history. You can explain prior convictions, failures to pay rent, evictions, or any other problems. A cover letter is an important part of the rental application process and shows you&#8217;re interested.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 3: Pay the rental application fee.</strong></h3>



<p>Generally, there will be a fee for you to pay as a part of the rental application process. This fee is usually between $30-$50 and varies based on location or the landlord. Usually, this fee is taken to fund background checks on potential tenants.</p>

<p>In some cases, there may also be processing fees that may or may not be refundable. Be sure to ask the landlord for a breakdown of the fees and whether they&#8217;re refundable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 4: Provide references.</strong></h3>



<p>Landlords will want to know if you had or caused any issues in the past. Proving that you have a good history is important. Landlords will not give an apartment on rent if you have caused property damage or broken the terms of your lease in the past.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a first-time renter and don&#8217;t have any rental history, get personal references! Personal references can make or break an application in these cases. A figure of authority or supervisor can vouch for your character and dependability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 5: Sign the dotted line!</strong></h3>



<p>Provided all has gone well and you’ve been accepted, you&#8217;ll now have to sign your lease. Congratulations! This is the final step of the rental application process. Make sure you go over all the terms carefully.</p>



<p>Also, take one final look at the premises and ensure everything is in order. This is also when you&#8217;ll need to discuss and pay upfront costs. It&#8217;s standard to pay the first month’s rent and move-in fees or security deposits as required.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How long does it take to process a rental application?</strong></h2>



<p>You can expect background and credit scores, references, residence history, other documents you&#8217;ve submitted to be checked as a part of the rental application process.</p>



<p>The time it takes can vary from one landlord to the other, but on average is around 24-72 hours. Some properties may take longer than this, but you&#8217;ll usually be informed in that case. If you haven&#8217;t heard back in 72 hours, you can contact the landlord and ask for an update.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It seems the darn things can infect even the cleanest and most premium of places! There is just no way to be positive that a house will forever be free of bed bugs. The tenant will blame it on the landlord, and the landlord will blame it on the tenant, but the problem, of course, will persist. Whose job is it to get rid of the pests?</p>



<p>That’s why some <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-apartment-features-check-signing-lease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rental agreement leases</a> signed between tenants and landlords have an addendum (or an addition) called the Bed Bug Addendum. The Bed Bug Addendum is part of the pest control section of the lease that lays down both the landlord’s and the tenant’s rights and responsibilities should a bed bug infestation occur. This article covers the tenant’s rights and responsibilities.</p>



<p><em>Please note that the bed bug addendum is strictly followed as per law in only a few states. However, all major cities usually have equivalent addendums in their rental agreements where similar rules apply. Please check with your state laws before taking action.</em></p>



<p><strong>Bed bug addendum from the landlord’s standpoint, in a nutshell:</strong> The landlord has inspected and ensured that the house you’re renting is free of bed bugs. “And if you sign it, you officially acknowledge it.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the tenant’s responsibilities?</strong></h2>



<p>When you sign the bed bug addendum in your rental agreement, here are the responsibilities you’re agreeing to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ensure all the furnishings and personal items you’ll be moving into the house are free of bed bugs</li>



<li>Check for hitchhiking bed bugs after you have spent time elsewhere</li>



<li>Inform the landlord immediately if you do face bed bug issues</li>



<li>Cooperate with the landlord for all <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-diy-pest-control-measures-for-your-home-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pest control</a> efforts</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://cchealth.org/bedbugs/pdf/2016-Bedbug-lease-Addendum.pdf" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Here’s a form with detailed</a> responsibilities of residents, for example.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Things to remember</strong></h2>



<p>You are not required to sign the bed bug addendum unless you’re certain of the absence of the pests. <strong>The addendum comes with strict rules</strong>, including agreements regarding pest control fees, attorney fees, not holding the landlord responsible for an infestation, confirmation of personal property insurance, etc.</p>



<p>So<strong>, before you sign the rental agreement lease</strong>, ask if the apartment has had bedbug infestations in the past. If yes, note this in your lease’s inventory form for future reference. You can have the property inspected before moving in – exterminators and pest control experts do this. Additionally, the landlord can also have pest control experts to inspect your apartment once you start living there.</p>



<p><strong>Once you’ve become a resident</strong>, if you discover bedbugs in the apartment, write a signed and dated letter to your landlord; never let it be a verbal agreement. Send the letter through certified mail and request a return receipt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Help! There’s an infestation!</strong></h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Is it the landlord’s responsibility to get rid of the bedbugs?</h4>



<p>In most cases, the landlord is in charge of dealing with the pests, given that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You inform them in writing</li>



<li>You have been punctual with rent payment</li>



<li>You’re not the cause of the infestation</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Who pays for the extermination?</h3>



<p>This depends on who is guilty of the bed bug infestation. This is where the landlord may use the signed bed bug addendum against you claiming that there were no bugs before you moved in. If there’s no proof of who caused the infestation, you and your landlord can consider splitting the pest control fees.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What if my landlord avoids the problem?</h3>



<p>Usually, your landlord has a week to respond to your written complaint. (Confirm with your state laws.) After the week is up, you can go to the court to force your landlord to hire exterminators, pay for your expenses, and offset your rent.</p>



<p><strong>Another point to remember:</strong> It is illegal for a landlord to retaliate with a resident who has filed a complaint or contacted the government or an NGO about a pest infestation. Your health and safety are more important and the landlord will face serious consequences if they take action against you.</p>
