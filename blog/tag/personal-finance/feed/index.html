<p>The world doesn’t run the way it did for the previous generation and today&#8217;s millennials have new challenges to face and paths to carve. Although some things come easy, many of us tend to struggle with financial management.</p>



<p>As a wise person once said &#8211; sometimes it&#8217;s not about the money, but rather the process of managing the money.</p>



<p>While having a steady income helps set a foundation for financial stability, it doesn’t end there. Here are 5 common personal finance mistakes that are made and you should avoid &#8211;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Spending at the same rate as you earn: not setting personal finance goals</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:57%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o6Mbcz94dOkPD2lDW" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Mbcz94dOkPD2lDW/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Once you start earning, it gets tempting to spend on things you’ve always wanted. Living in the moment certainly has an appeal but beware of getting lost in the sauce. It leaves you with nothing for a rainy day or your future. Get a handle on your personal finance goals early on.</p>



<p>Another trap that millennials often fall into is the ‘lifestyle inflation’ snare. Don’t spend all of your bonus on an exotic holiday or upgrade to a bigger apartment just because you got a raise.</p>



<p>With good financial management, you can do all of this just a few years down the line and without having to worry about your bank balance depleting. We’re not saying you should live like a hermit, but who can deny the importance of making a budget in New York?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Wealth is not about having a lot of money, it&#8217;s about having a lot of options.</p><cite>Chris Rock</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Not understanding how your credit score affects your personal finance</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xUA7baGIM9U95fCTEk" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7baGIM9U95fCTEk/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Is your credit score important? Yes! There are so many myths about what influences your credit score.</p>



<p><strong>If you don’t have your info straight, you could unintentionally be <em>harming your own credit score!</em> Here are a few quick points to remember when you put together a budget in New York:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>850 is the best credit score. However, as long as you have a number above 740, you will be eligible for the best lending rates.</li><li>Your payment history, your debt and your balances impact your credit score the most.</li><li>Pay off your debt in time and the full amounts due. Carrying balances when you don’t need to will add interest to your loan <em>and</em> bring your credit score down.</li><li>Try not to use over 30% of the credit available to you at any given time!</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Not signing up for health insurance</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:52%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/mAIPd6GH5qB4nFTfQ5" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/mAIPd6GH5qB4nFTfQ5/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Insurance is an important part of your financial management. In case you didn&#8217;t know, not having health insurance could mean being charged with a penalty when you file your taxes. There is also the danger of an accident or unexpected illness that can blow way past your personal budget in New York.</p>



<p>It’s a big gamble that could put you in debt. In some cases, even graduates can be covered by their parents’ health insurance. If you’re not eligible, look for the best possible plan keeping in mind the essential nature.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Poor financial management and having too many credit cards</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/hZq5XitsxurUBzfWFP" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/hZq5XitsxurUBzfWFP/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Using a credit card instead of a debit card does offer an additional layer of safety from identity theft or fraud. But beware of signing up for more credit cards than you can handle. It’s important to pay them off every month so as to not let debt pile up.</p>



<p>If you entered the workforce recently, focus on building up your bank account rather than spending cash. Once you have a decent balance, it will become easier to pay off your cards. Remember that a credit card is not there to pay for your necessities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5.Putting all your savings in a single fund (and not having a rainy day fund)</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:104%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/mg2Xa0af44fFm" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/mg2Xa0af44fFm/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Many millennials make the mistake of saving for just one thing at a time – like for a house or a car. However, if 2020 has taught us anything, is that you need to be prepared for unexpected situations. So, having an emergency fund is key. This should be able to support you through an illness, an accident, or job loss for about 3-6 months.</p>



<p>A rainy-day fund is for a different, smaller purpose. It’s for an emergency plumbing repair or a sudden trip to the mechanic. Setting aside money for emergencies and unexpected expenses means you don’t have to dig into your main savings nest egg. It offers plenty more financial stability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The movie Wolf of Wall Street starring the dynamic Leonardo Dicaprio is a popular cult classic, primarily due to the outrageously true story it tells about the former Wall Street mogul Jordan Belfort. He quickly jumped through the ranks of brokers at Wall Street to attain the golden NYC dream of a large mansion and even larger bank account.</p>



<p>In the famous, catchy lyrics of rapper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy4n88CjiBY&amp;list=PLEUt5XeZei-szK0m5V4zVxjpFVRajewYb&amp;index=6">We</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy4n88CjiBY&amp;list=PLEUt5XeZei-szK0m5V4zVxjpFVRajewYb&amp;index=6" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy4n88CjiBY&amp;list=PLEUt5XeZei-szK0m5V4zVxjpFVRajewYb&amp;index=6"> Walker</a>:</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>These words accurately reflect the glorified lifestyle of the high-riding, bank account-breaking Wall Street broker. He eventually faced downfall when he became complicit in his power as a wealthy businessman, believing he could do no wrong.</p>



<p>Although the Wolf of Wall Street may have acquired his wealth through <em>ahem</em> illicit means— as all legends have their pitfalls— <strong>he left behind some key lessons on financial management that we can all appreciate.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Roomi delves deeper into the lessons from Jordan Belfort that open the door to better personal finance choices, cash flow and financial freedom.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Follow along for tips on how to save money while living in the city and ensure prime financial management, inspired by the Wolf of Wall Street himself.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Have a healthy relationship with your bank account</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">

</div>
</div>



<p>One of the primary lessons on personal finance we can learn from the film is to have a good relationship with your money. <strong>As the saying goes, the more you take care of your money, the more it will take care of you!</strong> If the numbers in your bank account stress you out and financial management feels like the hill you will die on, remember financial planning help is always around the corner.</p>



<p>Personal finance apps are a great way to keep track of your cash flow. Financial freedom is a slow and steady process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Avoid initial public offerings (IPOs) and shady investment opportunities!</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%">

</div></figure>



<p>Jordan Belfort enjoyed the fruits of his financial scams via fraudulent IPOs (initial public offerings) and “pump and dump” schemes. <strong>It is important to remember that stock brokers or financial representatives do not keep your financial freedom or personal finances in mind when making deals.</strong> The end goal and business model for these companies is to reward the seller, more than you, the buyer. Your financial planning is your own first priority.</p>



<p><strong>If the investment scheme offers returns that seem too good to be true, steer clear!</strong> Greed leads to bad decision-making and never bodes well for financial management. When investing, take calculated risks that won’t hurt your bank account and cash flow in the long run.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Create a core set of values for your personal finance</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%">

</div>
</div>



<p>Financial planning doesn’t have to be hard. Grab a journal, sticky note or write it on your mirror! Create your own personal golden rules for financial management. <strong>This could be as easy as a note on your fridge “Take out only on Fridays!” or a reminder to spend on that Starbucks drink only on the first Monday of the month.</strong> Small reminders in addition to tracking your expenses each week can help you stay on top of your personal finances and focus on keeping a regular cash flow.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Seek out new opportunities and be open to learning</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%">

Pick up the phone and start dialing! I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich! </p><cite>Jordan Belfort</cite></blockquote>
</div>
</div>

</div></figure>



<p>This is a great lesson in persistence, and being open to whatever opportunities are out there when financial management is tough and you need the extra cash flow. <strong>Don’t shy away from new jobs, or small part-time gigs that might help your bank account and gain some financial freedom.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Remember it’s okay to make mistakes!</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">

If you have persistence, you will come out ahead of most people. More importantly, you will learn. When you do something, you might fail. But that’s not because you’re a failure. It’s because you have not learnt enough. Do it differently each time. One day, you will do it right. Failure is your friend.” </p><cite>Jordan Belfort</cite></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Belfort experienced a major downfall when his illegal investment schemes came to light, and was ordered to repay close to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-wolf/wolf-of-wall-street-says-his-story-offers-lesson-idINTRE7930PM20111004?edition-redirect=in" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">$200 million</a> that he had earned, as reported by Reuters. He gradually helped return all the money through financial advising and business ethics lectures.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>The lesson: don’t give up on your personal finance goals.</strong> With proper financial planning, a little bit of strict financial management, it won’t be long before you stop looking for “tips to save money”. <strong>Learn from your past mistakes- identify transactions on your bank account statements where you spend the most money and rectify as you go.</strong> Don’t be afraid to set goals for yourself, and try again when you fall short. Trying your best till you succeed is the true secret to financial freedom.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Benefits and Importance of Personal Finance Management</h2>



<p>Money comes and money goes. That is a basic rule of life as well as personal finance management. If money is transient, then why should we learn to manage it? Taking the time to manage our money better can really pay off in helping us lead an organized and stress-free life. If you don&#8217;t know where to start, many finance management books can help you get started.</p>



<p>Additionally, budgeting is an important part of the picture. If done well, it can create room for us to have control over our finances, as opposed to being tormented by thoughts of money, and letting our lives be controlled by money -or the lack of it.</p>



<p>Managing our personal finance is the most basic way to achieve financial freedom &#8211; free from stressing about our bank balance, with the freedom to make the most of our lives with what we have.</p>



<p>Here, we explain the benefits and importance of investing time and effort into personal finance management.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Personal finance management&#8217;s first rule: Stay in control of your finances</h3>



<p>Often, we&#8217;re so consumed by our thoughts of making, spending and saving money, it might overshadow the simple joys of living. These thoughts can inculcate a fear in us that makes us avoid looking at how much money we have, living from paycheck to paycheck in the hope we&#8217;ll be alright.</p>



<p>What we fear though, is the unknown!</p>



<p>So if you&#8217;re scared of looking at your personal finances because you haven&#8217;t checked them, the fear is only going to grow bigger the longer you avoid the situation. And remember, when you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re afraid of, you&#8217;re unable to take back control of it.</p>



<p>In order to gain control over your personal finances, you must face them! Your bank balance isn&#8217;t so scary after all, we promise. Plus, reading a few finance management books will make you feel more comfortable dealing with your own money.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Having a soft financial bed to fall back makes finance management easier</h3>



<p>Personal finance management also makes it easier to face adversity. From a broken thermostat to a medical emergency, knowing how much money you have available each month will help you keep a savings tab (however little it might be!). That can later help to alleviate some of the stress from an already stressful situation.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Get rid of the excuses you make and start achieving your goals</h3>



<p>A solid budget for personal finance management can help align your finances to your future and get you started on achieving your personal goals. Whether your dream is backpacking in the mountains, or simply having enough to quit a job you hate, saving for the future is one of the most beneficial things you can do with your money as personal finance management.</p>



<p>So stop making excuses for your dreams, and start accounting for them. Even if it takes time to reach your goals, preparing for them financially will eventually get you there. Start by reading a few finance management books to help you get a handle on the basics.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Stop wasting money</h3>



<p>Another great advantage of having a personal finance management plan is that when you look closely at your budget, you can see where you&#8217;re making mistakes, and yes, that includes wasting money on buying unnecessary things you don&#8217;t need!</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve spotted those, you can stop pouring money down the shopping drain and use it for better things &#8211; such as an investment in future plans, learning new skills, hobbies or paying back personal debts (if you have any.)</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t stop singing &#8216;money, money, money, must be funny, in a rich man&#8217;s world?&#8217; And has it become the unwanted background song in your personal life&#8217;s feature film, as you make a plan to ask your parents for money? We feel you!</p>



<p>At some point or another in our lives, we&#8217;ve all had to come face to face with the nasty inevitable: Being broke!</p>



<p>Maybe you&#8217;re in college and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/managing-personal-finance-by-sticking-to-your-budget-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">have overspent your budget</a>. Or maybe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5ya3ou/millennials_of_reddit_ages_1834_how_much/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">you&#8217;re a millennial</a> and need to ask your parents for money to work on a brilliant business idea. No matter what your reason, the conversation about asking your parents for money can fill you with dread.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re seriously broke and are down to your last few funds, it might be giving you the palpitations. You might have come to the conclusion that you&#8217;ll have to ask your parents for money sooner rather than later. And procrastinating about this will only make you suffer more.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s get down to the nitty-gritty! Here are some ways to ask other family members or parents for money when you run the risk of going broke.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Make an acceptance speech about your flaws </h2>



<p>So you&#8217;ve decided to ask your parents for money? Then you&#8217;ll have to get ready for a lecture that is rightly in order. But here&#8217;s a way to combat the shame. Go over your spending habits and recognize and accept your failures when it comes to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/the-importance-of-personal-finance-management-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">handling finances responsibly</a>. </p>



<p>So when you ask your parents for money, tell them that you know what your faults are. Add to it the many ways you&#8217;ve devised to work towards correcting them in the future (and mean it). Being tough with yourself now could help you control your spending habits in future.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ask the right relative or parent for money</h2>



<p>The kind of person you choose to ask will make or break this deal. If you&#8217;re thinking of asking someone that has already been struggling with their finances, you should probably drop the idea. If they do lend you some despite the fact, you&#8217;ll just end up causing unwarranted stress for them. So observe your family members to spot the richest (and most generous) one.</p>



<p>Another point to keep in mind is you should look for someone whom you trust and who trusts you. Don&#8217;t ask a relative who already bugs you about your lifestyle choices! Make sure the borrowing and lending act doesn&#8217;t create an unnecessary rift between you two.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Ask parents for money to fulfill needs, not desires</h2>



<p>Are you asking your parents for money to indulge in luxuries or go on a trip you can easily postpone? Then forget about it. Adulting includes its share of sacrifices and requires you to make lifestyle choices within your budget. Even if they do lend you some, you won&#8217;t be able to learn the lessons that being broke teaches you! As a result you&#8217;ll always end up resorting to ask parents for money when you&#8217;re in need.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re struggling to cover basic necessities, then you should ask your parents for money. Give them a breakdown of how much you need and where their loan will go if you get it. The more sincere you are, the more your parents, siblings, or relatives will understand.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/RHPqFeeeNhXsRqF0yb" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/RHPqFeeeNhXsRqF0yb/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Try the written word to ask parents for money</h2>



<p>If you can&#8217;t bring yourself to verbally ask your parents for money, and your mouth seals shut whenever they start talking about how responsible you&#8217;ve become, try the written word. Pen out a sincere handwritten letter, email, or a long text message about <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/tips-to-manage-your-finances-without-stressing-out-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your financial worries</a>. Tell them why you need it and how you&#8217;re working to<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> make your financial planning better.</a></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Suggest a good repayment plan on your loan</h2>



<p>Just because you&#8217;re asking your parents for money, you shouldn&#8217;t try and get a free pass for the repayment of a loan. Suggest a reasonable tenure and a repayment plan &#8211; with interest if necessary. This will show that you&#8217;re ready to be responsible. And that becoming broke right now is a hiccup, not your way of life. Ask them for their suggestions and pen it out with your signatures to make it official.</p>
