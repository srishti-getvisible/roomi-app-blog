<p>Moving out and living in an apartment can be a liberating experience. You&#8217;re finally out of your parents&#8217; hair, plus you get to stay in the city you&#8217;ve always dreamed about. But there&#8217;s a downside to your newfound freedom. And that&#8217;s using shared living spaces in the property. Part of the reality of being a renter is using a communal kitchen and sharing a bathroom.</p>



<p>Showering and grooming can be a hellish experience depending on your roomis. If you live with slobs, you&#8217;re probably all too familiar with the sight of hair stuck in the drain. Or that mildew building up on the shower curtains. If you&#8217;re the unhygienic roommate, it&#8217;s time to get your act together so you don&#8217;t gross your fellow renters out. Living in an apartment, after all, is all about respecting other people&#8217;s need for clean and safe spaces.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there are ways to make any shared bathroom a welcoming spot for everyone. Here are some handy hacks to get you started.</p>

<p>It can be chaotic when everyone&#8217;s scrambling to use the bathroom at the same time each day. When the entire apartment needs to get ready for work or school, your shower schedules are sure to clash.</p>



<p>This problem can easily be solved by coming up with a pre-agreed shower schedule. Set a time for every person to shower and apply a time limit, so no one hogs the bathroom.</p>



<p>When sharing a bathroom, it&#8217;s also important that everyone pitches in to keep it as spotless and germ-free as possible. This is where a cleaning schedule comes in. Take turns cleaning the bathroom at least once a week, using a checklist to make sure all surfaces are properly sanitized. Don&#8217;t skip the jobs everyone hates, here!</p>

<p></p>



<p>On top of the weekly cleaning schedule, it&#8217;s good manners to clean up after using the bathroom. With any shared living spaces, simple acts like wiping surfaces dry go a long way to keeping the area fresh. Store multipurpose spray or wipes under the cabinet, so no one has an excuse not to clean as they go! Some simple maintenance after you shower helps to keep mold and hard water build-up at bay.</p>



<p>Sharing a bathroom also means not leaving any traces of hair behind. For the gentlemen, try using a grooming mat to catch all your mustache and beard trimmings every time you shave. This is a non-slip material you place on top of the sink while you get rid of that five o&#8217;clock shadow. Just dust the hair into a trashcan and you&#8217;re done with cleanup.</p>

<p>Since you&#8217;re sharing a bathroom with roommates, you want to be extra mindful about how much time you spend there. It&#8217;s primarily meant, after all, for essentials like showering and doing your business on the toilet. Consider doing your grooming activities like styling your hair, putting on makeup, and checking out your outfit in your room. Invest in a vanity or full-length mirror so you can carry out your beauty routine there instead of in the shared bathroom.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Sharing a bathroom with roommates can get pretty messy, especially if everyone leaves their body washes, shampoo bottles and toothbrushes lying around. One trick is to buy a shower caddy &#8211; those plastic baskets that hold your stuff. Every time you shower, just bring it with your things inside so they don&#8217;t get mixed in with everyone else&#8217;s.</p>



<p>If the entire home has a caddy, simply hang them up with wall adhesives and label them with names. Now everyone has a place to store their shower essentials.</p>

<p>With shared living spaces, there&#8217;s a big chance that you and your roommates use a lot of the same products &#8211; from shaving gel to hairdryers. Make the most of the space under the sink to store these shared items and make them accessible.</p>



<p>You can find a lot of organizing bins and baskets on Amazon to store things like a pro. Label them with individual names or just write &#8220;everyone&#8221; on the items you&#8217;re happy to share. You can also hang hooks over the door for towels, so you don&#8217;t have to step over wet, dirty towels when sharing a bathroom.</p>

<p>When sharing a bathroom, no one wants to use one that smells disgusting. It&#8217;s particularly awkward and embarrassing if you leave it stinky and a roommate needs to use it right after you.</p>



<p>Scents can do a lot to make using the area more pleasant. Lighting a scented candle, using an aromatic diffuser, or just spritzing a room spray can instantly uplift the bathroom&#8217;s vibe. Try leaving a bag of potpourri to perfume the bathroom. Every time you do number two, you can also use poo sprays to mask those unwanted odors.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to keep sharing a bathroom with roommates that&#8217;s dirty, smelly, and cluttered. But at the end of the day, not everyone is a germophobe or a neat freak. While everyone can agree on rules and responsibilities, there&#8217;s always someone bound to mess up every now and then. Remember to take it easy and don&#8217;t get mad if someone forgets to leave out a fresh roll of toilet paper.</p>

<p>Did you know one of the most common reasons for clashes among couples is because of sharing a closet? Fighting over a disorganized closet, closet clutter, and not being able to find items are the most common causes of arguments between couples when it comes to sharing a closet. But you don&#8217;t need to go through all these ordeals like other couples. Try these 11 closet organization ideas and create a more harmonious space with your significant other!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-declutter">1. Declutter</h3>



<p>Unless you&#8217;re moving to a mansion with a shared walk-in closet, you need to manage with small closet space. Before organizing it, sort and segregate your belongings and review each of the items carefully. Ask yourself these three questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Have you worn it recently?</li>



<li>Does it fit?</li>



<li>Will you need it in the future?</li>
</ul>



<p>If your response is a no to all three questions, it is time to discard or donate the item. Make it a habit and repeat this exercise every season.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-work-with-your-partner-if-you-re-sharing-a-closet">2. Work with your partner if you&#8217;re sharing a closet</h3>



<p>Organizing a shared closet takes teamwork. Many couples prefer to split their closet space 50/50 but you don&#8217;t need to follow the same rule if you don&#8217;t want to. Instead, discuss your work time, morning routine, and habits to organize your closet. The purpose here is to not get into each other&#8217;s way while getting ready for the day.</p>



<p>For example, if both of you need to get ready for work at the same time, it makes sense to organize your stuff on two sides of the closet. But if you don&#8217;t need to access the closet simultaneously, you can share the drawer or the hanging rods without getting into each other&#8217;s way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-store-off-season-items-separately">3. Store off-season items separately</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re sharing a small closet with spouse, use your closet space to store everyday work clothes, accessories, shoes, etc. Store all the off-season clothes like leather jackets, skirts, heavy woolens, etc., in separate storage boxes. Place them under your bed or any other corner of the room.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-label-storage">4. Label storage</h3>



<p>Storage boxes come in handy when sharing a closet. They can make up for drawers if you don&#8217;t have too many drawer spaces. Keep separate storage boxes for shoes, hats, innerwear, belts, etc. Label them or color-code them so that you don&#8217;t need to scramble through everything when getting ready.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-hire-a-professional">5. Hire a professional</h3>



<p>When you&#8217;re sharing a closet and your closet space is premium, hire a professional designer to maximize space utilization. A professional can help you customize the closet space by adding a shelf here or a cubby there, adding long and short rods, or shoe racks. Additionally, you can include a specialized storage accessory on your side of the closet, like a belt rack on one side and a jewelry drawer organizer on the other.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-consider-double-hanging">6. Consider double hanging</h3>



<p>Every closet can have enough space if you know how to use it cleverly. Couples sharing a closet often prefer double hanging because it&#8217;s the least expensive way to maximize closet space. What&#8217;s cool is with double hanging, you can store two times the shirts, blouses, and pants in the same vertical space.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-choose-velvet-hangers-over-wooden-or-plastic-hangers">7. Choose velvet hangers over wooden or plastic hangers</h3>



<p>Get rid of your chunky wooden and plastic hangers that chew up space and look ugly. Replace them with cohesive hangers. Velvet hangers especially look nice. They are sturdy, add space, and make your closet look much cleaner.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-maintain-your-shared-closet">8. Maintain your shared closet</h3>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re splitting your closet 50/50 or 70/30, you need to keep your closet organized for it to remain functional. Maintain some checks and balances to keep it clean and clutter-free. Like, whenever you take something out of the closet, put it back in the same place. And once a year, take time off from your regular schedule to do an annual decluttering of the closest to keep things organized.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-use-additional-storage">9. Use additional storage</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re still running out of closet space, consider using under-the-bed storage to store what you only occasionally need. Another idea is to utilize your wall—place hooks to hang your daily wears, belts, ties, and necklaces. Just remember to keep it neat and don&#8217;t dump everything on the hook. You can use creative racks on your bedroom wall where you can keep your accessories neatly arranged.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-practice-the-one-in-one-out-rule">10. Practice the one-in-one-out rule</h3>



<p>If you have limited closet space and there&#8217;s no possibility of increasing the closet space, practice the one-in-one-out rule. In practice, this means if you buy a new pair of shoes or a new dress, something needs to be taken out and either recycled or donated.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-create-visible-boundaries">11. Create visible boundaries</h3>



<p>One person&#8217;s belongings drifting to another partner&#8217;s territory is not an unusual scene when it comes to sharing a closet. So it is a good idea to use colored-coded baskets and bins to segregate the space inside the closet. You can even use different color hangers to hang clothes on the common hanging rod. Finally, use separate laundry boxes to gather your dirty clothes instead of impeding your partner&#8217;s closet.</p>



<p>Follow these basic but practical couple closet ideas to keep all your belongings organized, and there will be possibly no hang-ups &#8212; be it in your closet space or your relationship. Keep the lines of communication open when it comes to closet-related matters. Finally, be respectful of each other&#8217;s belongings and feelings. After all, these are just clothes. What matters most is your bond with one another.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-co-living-communities">What are Co-living communities?</h2>



<p>Co-living communities are a modern, communal form of living. Here, each of the residents have their own personal room and shared communal spaces. They provide residents with a personal room and privacy like an apartment. However, the communal or common areas are shared by residents like in a dorm. They are particularly popular among students, young professionals, and digital nomads. <a href="https://und.edu/blog/what-is-an-msw-degree.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Master of Social Work</a> students find these communities ideal for fostering a sense of belonging and support, while still allowing them to maintain the privacy needed for their intensive studies and self-care routines.</p>

<p>Co living communities will almost always be cheaper than an apartment. While having a roommate could bring the costs down, co living spaces will save you more. If you are on a tight budget, you will be better off going with co living communities. With the rents in major cities soaring, they are a way to ease the pressure on the housing market.</p>

<p>While you do share communal areas, co living communities give you your personal space. Thus, you and the other residents have your personal rooms. This gives you a lot more privacy compared to a dorm and can be important for some people. You will still need to share communal spaces and use common utilities. However, you can always retreat to your own room if you need a break or some &#8216;me time.&#8217;</p>

<p>When you share an apartment with someone, conflicts are bound to arise. There’s no way to avoid them. It’s one of the less pleasant parts of the whole coliving experience. And if you’re a conflict-averse person, then it’s probably even worse for you! I mean, no one likes fighting with the person you share an apartment with. After all, your home is supposed to be your safe haven, not a boxing ring. But no matter what you do, problems will arise and it is your job to deal with them head-on. Sharing apartments with roommates means you need to be respectful of one another. After all, your home should be your sanctuary. And we are here to help you with that. If you don’t think you’re good with conflicts, don’t get stressed out. Here are some tips for conflict resolution that will make your coliving experience blissful!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Share an Apartment? You need rules!</strong></h2>



<p>When you’re sharing apartments with roommates, most conflicts arise because you guys have different expectations of each other. Maybe you want your roommate to clean the dishes immediately after a meal. Maybe they expect you to clean the apartment more often. All of these things can pent up and will eventually make coliving a nightmare for you. So, the best thing to do is to set some ground rules before you even have any conflicts. These rules can be anything- whatever makes it easier to share an apartment with your roommate. If it helps, you can also write this down and stick it on the fridge.&nbsp; Now no one can back out of it!</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/179923-13-essential-rules-to-have-with-your-roommates-according-to-reddit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here is a list of essential ground rules that will make your life a million times better!</a></pre>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Find a common ground</strong></h2>



<p>When you’re sharing apartments with roommates, you can’t always be stubborn about doing things your way. That coliving etiquette 101. You need to be kind and empathetic towards your roommates and listen to what their needs are. You know, how when you’re having a really bad day, sometimes you just want the other person to listen, and not give their opinions? That’s kinda what you sometimes have to do when you share an apartment. When there’s a conflict with your roommates, just sit down and listen to their side. Find a common ground. Believe me, this whole coliving thing will be a lot easier if you work hard to like the other person.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ask For Help</h2>



<p>Now, every once in a while you and your roommates will find yourselves in a situation where you just can’t seem to agree with one another. Sharing apartments with roommates can be incredibly frustrating at times. Here is where you bring in an outsider. But be mindful, this person should be completely neutral to the problem at hand. If your mediator ends up taking sides, your coliving situation will only get worse from there. Instead, find a common friend or neighbor who will resolve this conflict for you in a kind and professional manner. This is one of the most mature ways to deal with conflict when you share an apartment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Talk it out before you walk it out!</h2>



<p>Have you ever been so frustrated with your roommate that you’ve just wanted to move out? Contract be damned. Don’t worry, we’ve all been there. It’s a quintessential part of the coliving experience. But you’re an adult now, you can’t give in to those petty impulses. Instead of walking out on the person you share an apartment with, talk it out with them. Don’t shout, don’t argue- just have a mature conversation about the problems you’re having. If you talk to them in a calm, rational manner, they will respond in a similar manner. And that’s what sharing apartments with roommates is all about.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be good to them!</h2>



<p>I’m sure you’ve heard the phrase, “relationships are two-way streets”, well, that applies when you’re coliving too. If you want good behavior from your roommates, then you gotta do the same. Sharing apartments with roommates is all about give-and-take. You can’t expect them to listen to you if you completely disregard everything they say. Being a good roommate yourself can make your relationship with the person you share an apartment with really prosper. And who knows, maybe it will lead to a friendship that lasts a lifetime!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When living with someone, things can get tough, or not, all depending on how well you and your roommates bond. And it&#8217;s always a two-way street. No relationship can successfully work if you&#8217;re not willing to put work into the relationship. On the other hand, neither will it work when the other side isn&#8217;t willing to make an effort.</p>



<p>But in certain scenarios &#8211; like when you share an apartment with a roommate who is not from the land you call home, you have to be a bit more considerate. And if you&#8217;ve been <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/living-in-nyc-5-common-myths-debunked-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living in NYC</a> all your life, you have to put more effort to make them comfortable.</p>



<p>Because when you move to a new place, you&#8217;re insecure and unsure of how to behave with other people. And when you have a roommate who is going to be living in NYC for the first time, they would be vulnerable and need your help.</p>



<p>So when you <a href="https://www.carroll.edu/sites/default/files/public-files/international-programs/guide/cross-cultural-roommate-handbook.pdf" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">share an apartment</a> with a cross-cultural roommate, start on the right foot by keeping these points in mind, when building your roommate relationship.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Tell them about life in NYC but also ask about their home and culture</h2>



<p>The first thing you&#8217;d want to know is the kind of place they come from. And they would surely want to get to know about living in NYC!</p>



<p>So when you start telling them about your culture, and all about living in NYC, remember that it&#8217;s always a good ice breaker to ask them about their life and culture.</p>



<p>So pour some drinks and order in your preferred delicious meal and start up a conversation about both your cultures.</p>



<p>Think of it this way, you&#8217;re traveling to another part of the world without moving out of your living room!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Language difference</h3>



<p>Another thing to note here would be the differences in language. If they don&#8217;t know English well, volunteer to teach them a few language essentials that will make living in NYC a bit easier for them.</p>



<p>And in the process, learn a few words and phrases in their language too! They will feel less like an outsider, and you&#8217;ll start having fun in the process too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Let go of the stereotypes of where they come from</h2>



<p>Thanks to the globalization of cultures, we all have a few stereotypes in our minds about other countries or cities or states we might not even have visited and seen for ourselves. So make sure you don&#8217;t let such stereotypes come in the way and offend the roommate you&#8217;re going to share an apartment with.</p>



<p>Always be respectful of where they come from, and try to get to know your roommate outside of their culture before categorizing them into media-fed stereotypes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Allow them to introduce you to their entertainment culture</h2>



<p>What&#8217;s better than getting great foreign movie recommendations from your new roommate? A good way to bond and cover the cultural gap is to be curious about their entertainment culture.</p>



<p>Everyone loves Hollywood, yes, but there&#8217;s a great amount of entertainment outside of Hollywood too! Ask them to introduce you to some <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/10-movies-that-capture-new-york-perfectly-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">native movies</a> and music to make sharing an apartment with them a lot more fun!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Don’t force them to follow your way of life in NYC</h2>



<p>It might seem like living in NYC is the only way to live if you don&#8217;t look beyond the borders that make this world up. But don&#8217;t try and force your ways on to your roomis.</p>



<p>They might have a very different way of living and cohabiting, so always try to respect that instead of telling them what the right thing to do is. Make boundaries that give them the freedom to live the way they like to (as long as they don&#8217;t violate <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/healthy-living-for-you-and-your-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the house rules of your apartment</a>.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Respect time zone differences</h2>



<p>If you share an apartment with a roomi who comes from a different country, chances are that they&#8217;ll take time when adjusting to the new time zone they&#8217;ve entered. This also means they might be talking to friends and family in their home country at odd hours.</p>
