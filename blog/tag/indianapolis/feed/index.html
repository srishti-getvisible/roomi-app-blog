<p>Colloquially known as Indy, Indianapolis is the state capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Indiana as well as the seat of Marion County. If you&#8217;re looking at rooms for rent in Indianapolis, here&#8217;s basically everything you need to know about the city!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting to know Indianapolis</strong></h2>



<p>Indianapolis is in the East North Central region of the Midwestern United States, in central Indiana. It is also the 16th largest city by land area in the US. In total, there are about 35 streams in the city, including Indian Creek and Pogue&#8217;s Run. Also, major bodies of water include Indian Lake, Geist Reservoir, and Eagle Creek Reservoir. It is also what one might refer to as a planned city.</p>



<p>Compared with similar-sized American cities, Indianapolis is unique. Especially since it contains some 200 farms covering thousands of acres of agricultural land within its municipal boundaries. Equestrian farms and corn and soybean fields interspersed with suburban development are very common on the city&#8217;s periphery, especially in Franklin Township.</p>



<p>Additionally, the stark contrast between Indianapolis&#8217;s urban neighborhoods and rural villages is a result of the 1970 city-county consolidation. This also expanded the city&#8217;s incorporated boundary to be one with Marion County. For those hoping to rent a room in Indianapolis, there is nature and so much more to look forward to!</p>

<p>The city is divided into 99 community areas for statistical purposes, though many smaller neighborhoods exist within them. Indianapolis&#8217; neighborhoods are often difficult to define because the city lacks historical ethnic divisions, as in <strong><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-chicago/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago</a></strong>.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Old North</strong></h3>



<p>Like most urban areas, the central city is again attracting residents. Initially, however, it was the elegant Victorian mansions of the Old Northside. Once the homes of the city&#8217;s wealthiest, these mostly frame homes had been subdivided into apartments in the mid-20th century. Also, they were the first area of downtown Indy to see gentrification at the turn of the 21st century.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fountain Square</strong></h3>



<p>Families and artists needing studio space gravitate to the neighborhood of Fountain Square. Also, the existing homes you will find here are larger. Additionally, the young professionals here love the downtown lofts. Why? Because they are specifically carved from the former factory and warehouse buildings on the eastern and southern edges of downtown.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pike Township</strong></h3>



<p>Pike Township has an eclectic mix of nationalities and backgrounds. You will find lots of physicians and professors here. Many of whom come from the Indian subcontinent, Europe, or South America. Most of them often work downtown, as well as on the campus of Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis. They prize not only the ease of access via I-65 but also the rural character of the area, which includes Eagle Creek Park.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Average rent in Indianapolis</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond the three neighborhoods mentioned above, Indianapolis is also home to other neighborhoods that have their own charm. For instance, Those used to big-city life gravitate Downtown — especially if they’re single or empty-nesters. Walking to work or the theater is easy, and also the Cultural Trail circles the core of the city with a landscaped bicycle route. So for those interested, here is the average rent in Indianapolis!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How transit-friendly is Indianapolis?</strong></h2>



<p>Indianapolis&#8217;s transportation infrastructure is fascinating for how convenient it is! Basically, it comprises a complex network that includes a local public bus system, several private intercity bus providers. But also the Amtrak passenger rail service via the Cardinal.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all, there&#8217;s also 282 miles or 454 km of freight rail lines, an Interstate Highway System, two airports, a heliport, bike share system, 115 miles (185 km) of bike lanes, and 110 miles (177 km) of trails and greenways. The city has also recently become known for its prevalence of electric scooters!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Walkability </strong></h3>



<p>Indianapolis&#8217; downtown is by far one of the most walkable in the country. On foot, visitors can reach hundreds of restaurants and attractions from their hotel and meeting space. Additionally, there exists an expansive network of climate-controlled skywalks connecting 4,700 hotel rooms to the convention center. These include the Lucas Oil Stadium, a four-story mall, and also restaurants that keep it walkable in all weather.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Roads and traffic</strong></h3>



<p>A <a href="https://www.courierpress.com/story/news/2021/01/22/driving-indiana-2nd-best-nation-study-says/4225556001/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent report</a> ranks Indiana as the second-best state for driving in the U.S. in 2020.</p>



<p>The report was done by WalletHub, which ranked all 50 states across 31 metrics, taking into account factors such as road quality, gas prices, insurance premiums, auto theft rates,&nbsp;and rush-hour traffic congestion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Electric Scooters </strong></h3>

They have since prompted the city to create new rules and regulations governing their use.</p>



<p>Safety remains the top-of-mind issue for everyone, so users are asked to ride on streets and in bike lanes, but not on sidewalks. You might also risk a fine if you happen to park in restricted areas or block sidewalk ramps, private driveways, or parking spaces. Several scooters have fallen victim to vandalism and have ended up in the downtown Canal. Still, many riders find them a convenient option for short-range local commutes or to fill in the gaps between IndyGo route stops.</p>

The $63 million-trail covers eight miles in total, linking five distinctive downtown cultural districts—Mass Ave, Fountain Square, the Canal and White River State Park, Indiana Avenue, and the Wholesale District. It also connects to the popular Monon Trail, built atop a former railroad line for access north to Broad Ripple, Carmel, and points beyond. Along the Cultural Trail, innovative public art installations, colorful murals, public gardens, and green spaces offer plenty of eye candy, not to mention contemplative food for thought. The best part? Guided tours are also available!</p>
