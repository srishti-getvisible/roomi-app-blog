										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Stepping out of your comfort zone and traveling to a new city is super rewarding. We get to experience new cultures and beautiful locations, and meet new people along the way. Some people believe you can’t truly experience a city unless you’ve lived there a while, so they head online to find their next temp home! Airbnb is one of the most popular booking sites for finding accommodation in cities all over the world. That said, it’s definitely not the only website you can use. With its surge in popularity, Airbnb listings often sell out fast! And, with such high demand, the prices have also shot up. So if you’re searching for an Airbnb alternative, we’ve got a list to start you off. Read on to discover websites like Airbnb that can make your travel hassle-free.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="top-sites-like-airbnb">Top Sites Like Airbnb</h2>



<p>Looking for an apartment to rent with some cool people? Or just looking for somewhere short-term to stay while you stopover before your next city? This list of sites like Airbnb has something for everyone &#8211; dive in!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-roomi">1. Roomi</h2>

<p>Roomi is one of the best room finders out there for many reasons. Let’s explore them below!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-listings">No-fee listings</h3>



<p>No-fee listings mean that, whether you book a room or a whole place, you’ll be paying no extra charges on top of the rent. It’s a cheaper alternative to Airbnb because what you see is what you pay.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If you’re traveling or moving with your pet, Roomi’s got you covered with its pet-friendly filters. Whether you have a dog, cat, or something entirely different, you can find listings that welcome your little friend with open arms.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Roomi offers a subletting service to take the complications out of subletting. That means you can rent out your place to other tenants, to save some money and do some more traveling! With secure in-app messaging and a robust verification process, you can sublet your apartment anywhere in the world that allows it!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="amenities">Amenities</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="753" height="167" data-attachment-id="19628" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/airbnb-alternative/attachment/amenities-on-roomi/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?fit=753%2C167&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="753,167" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="amenities-on-Roomi" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?fit=300%2C67&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?fit=753%2C167&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?resize=753%2C167&#038;ssl=1" alt="amenities-on-Roomi" class="wp-image-19628" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?w=753&amp;ssl=1 753w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?resize=300%2C67&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></figure></div>



<p>Whether you’re leasing a place for a short period or a longer duration, comfort is key. If it’s a doorman you need, a gym to unwind in, or an in-house washer to do laundry, you can choose from over 30 amenities on Roomi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="listing-type-and-house-rules">Listing Type and House Rules</h3>



<p>If all of this sounds too good to be true, it’s not! There are even more benefits of using Roomi as an Airbnb alternative. For example, you can filter by entire place, own room, or even a shared room. So both groups and solo travelers have enough options to choose from.</p>



<p>Once you’ve filtered by listing, you can also select house rules like whether smoking is allowed or guests can come over.</p>



<p>To sum it up, if you want a one-stop solution for all of your accommodation needs, Roomi is the way to go. They offer both a mobile app and website so all you have to do is visit this <a href="https://roomiapp.com/rooms" class="broken_link">link</a> and take it from there.</p>

<p>Another Airbnb alternative, VRBO is an abbreviation for Vacation Rental By Owner. As the name indicates, it’s great for renting places if you’re on vacation. It’s got over a million properties worldwide in the most popular travel destinations. However, if you’re looking to relocate, you might find this an expensive long-term rental. You also have to pay a booking fee when you select your rental.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Another website like Airbnb, Booking.com lets you filter through rooms and apartments. With an easy-to-use interface, this site can help you find a rental anywhere in the world. And what’s more? It’s usually a much cheaper alternative to Airbnb. However, you’re unlikely to be able to split the cost of renting with a roommate unless you’re traveling with them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-turnkey">4. TurnKey</h2>

<p></p>



<p>This Airbnb alternative offers something completely different. Instead of a key to your rental, you get a passcode to your door &#8211; completely eliminating the need for a middleman. It caters exclusively to vacationers and holiday goers. Unfortunately, it currently only caters to the United States so it’s not the best fit if you’re planning on going international.</p>

<p>This Airbnb alternative offers a fun way to travel. As the name suggests, you can swap houses with someone in another part of the world for your vacation. However, you will need to pay to sign up. And more importantly, while this could be great for a short period of time, you can’t relocate permanently using this website. If you’re a little iffy with the idea of letting someone else take over your property, you can choose to host people instead of swapping homes. This lets you earn ‘balloons’ that you can later use to travel.</p>

<p>Picture this: you&#8217;re moving to a new city, you don&#8217;t know many people, you&#8217;re trying to stay within your budget, and on top of that, you&#8217;re looking for a good apartment. These problems may have discouraged you in the past, but in these modern times, there are easier ways to find rooms for rent. With websites like Rent<a href="http://Rent.com" class="broken_link">.</a>com and Roomi, apartment hunting becomes smoother. However, between Rent.com and the Rent.com alternative, Roomi, which is the best room finder? Let&#8217;s find out!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?</h2>



<p>The perfect room finder is supposed to have all the features that make apartment hunting a breeze. Filters like price ranges and listings are among the many that can determine the best room finder for you. You may have come into contact with one or two Rent<a href="http://Rent.com" class="broken_link">.</a>com reviews, but we&#8217;re going to break down everything you need to know below.</p>



<p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/roomis-guide-for-the-first-time-renter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi&#8217;s Guide for the First Time Renter</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No fee apartments</h3>



<p>You probably don&#8217;t want to use your hard-earned money to pay broker fees. Well, you&#8217;re in luck because all Roomi listings are no fee, meaning you won&#8217;t have to fork out money from your budget to pay brokers.</p>



<p>Rent.com, however, can&#8217;t boast of this advantage, making Roomi a great Rent.com alternative.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-Friendly Apartments</h3>



<p>If you have a furry companion, you certainly have to consider them while searching for apartments. While Rent.com only offers cats and dogs pet filters, Roomi goes further by providing a filter for other pets, so nothing with fur, scales or feathers has to be left behind!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Rent.com reviews have shown that subletting with the room finder can be a hectic task. Users have to pay a big chunk of money and may have to wait months for their listing to get chosen. What makes Roomi one of the best room finders out there is the fact that it lets you browse through authentic listings by individuals who are verified. You&#8217;re also allowed to have at least 2 active listings on Roomi at any one time, which simplifies the subletting process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>Everyone has their preferences, and nobody wants a room-finding portal that doesn&#8217;t consider your needs. Both Roomi and Rent.com provide their users with an extensive list of amenities filters, where they can choose what they want according to their taste.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-based-on-listing-type-entire-rooms-shared-rooms">Filtering based on listing type (entire rooms/shared rooms)</h3>



<p>With Roomi, you&#8217;re allowed to filter through listing types. For example, if you want a roommate, you&#8217;ll be on the hunt for shared rooms. Roomi has got you covered in that aspect.</p>



<p>Rent.com doesn&#8217;t offer this feature. Many Rent.com reviews have also complained that some listings on the website are not current.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on house rules</h3>



<p>In our Roomi vs Rent.com comparison, Roomi takes the lead yet again. Roomi lets you filter rooms based on house rules, making your search easier and more convenient. If you have specific preferences like not wanting a roommate who smokes, then Roomi can help you arrange that.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?</h2>



<p>Nothing easy comes cheap, but Roomi strives to break that notion. You can do so much on Roomi for free, but subscribing to the premium plan will make your search that much easier.</p>



<p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/is-roomi-free-to-use/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Roomi free to use?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>Before going into the benefits of Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription plan, let&#8217;s talk about what you stand to gain for free. It&#8217;s free to sign up for Roomi, and you can also have 2 active listings. Some websites like Rent<a href="http://Rent.com" class="broken_link">.</a>com charge their customers for creating an account for listing, and on Rent.com, you&#8217;ll have to shell out a big sum of money to list an apartment.</p>



<p>The Roomi Gold membership allows you to increase your listings, or buy listing credits. It&#8217;s priced at $29.99 per month and $14.99 per week. This comes with goodies like free bookings, access to unlimited messages, an optional background check, and more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-app Messaging</h3>



<p>What makes Roomi stand out as one of the best room finders is the fact that you can easily connect with listers through the in-app messaging system. As mentioned earlier, you can send unlimited messages with the Roomi Gold plan.</p>



<p>Rent.com, on the other hand, allows you to contact listers by calls or emails, but many Rent.com reviews have shown that customers don&#8217;t get a response as quickly as they&#8217;d like.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?</h2>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>A good room finder places your safety and security as a top priority. Roomi, the Rent.com alternative, allows you to report suspected fake listings to their in-house content moderation team. Listers also have to go through a verification process to ensure that they are legit.</p>



<p>Roomi also ensures maximum security by not allowing your listing address to be visible to others, and only showing an approximate location.</p>



<p>Rent.com has a contact support team, but they only work during business hours and are not always timely in solving customer issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, which is the best room finder for you?</h2>



<p>If someone asks you, &#8216;Roomi vs Rent.com: which is better?&#8217;, the clear answer is Roomi. Roomi offers so many features that websites like Rent.com don&#8217;t, making it one of the best room finders on the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The internet is a giant ocean of Facebook groups, Craiglist listings, and Google ads. If you&#8217;ve swum your way here, chances are that you&#8217;ve struck out on many of these websites. Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;re not out of luck! When you&#8217;re on the hunt to find rooms to rents, there are several questions that might pop up. Is the listing legitimate? Will the new apartment be pet-friendly? Are there rooms with private bathrooms? This is where Roomi comes in. <strong>In this guide, we&#8217;ll walk you through the best room finder, Roomi, and why it&#8217;s the most wonderful Apartments.com alternative!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-have-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What Filters &amp; Preferences Do These Room Finders Have to Help you Find your Perfect Room?</h2>



<p>Roomi&#8217;s algorithm is designed to help you find your ideal room in seconds. While moving into a new neighborhood is a tedious task, finding rooms for rent shouldn&#8217;t be. This best Apartments.com alternative comes with basic filters such as price and location, but also more advanced filters to narrow down your search. Let&#8217;s take a look below at how these two-room finders fare side by side.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-Friendly Apartments</h3>

<p>A furry companion is like a family member. You can&#8217;t imagine your life without your pet, and with Roomi, you don&#8217;t have to! Fortunately, both Roomi and Apartments.com offer pet-friendly listings. However, if your companion isn&#8217;t a canine or a feline, you&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to find a listing on Apartments.com. The website only allows the filters of &#8220;Cat Friendly&#8221; and &#8220;Dog Friendly&#8221;. Meanwhile, Roomi strives to make your experience in a new rental comfortable and accessible to pets of all kinds. This great Apartments.com alternative offers three filters for pets: &#8220;Dogs OK&#8221;, &#8220;Cats OK&#8221;, and &#8220;Other Pets OK&#8221;. So, whether you have a pet bird or a pet tortoise, you can easily find listings on Roomi!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering Rooms Based on Amenities</h3>



<p>Would you like an on-site security guard for safety? Are you looking for an apartment with power backup? Whatever your wishes might be, Roomi is your genie! While Apartments.com also has advanced filters, you&#8217;ll notice that these are less thorough than Roomi&#8217;s.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering Rooms Based on Listing Type (Entire Place/Shared Rooms)</h3>



<p>Are you looking to find rooms to rent as a couple? Do you want to save money by sharing a room? The powerful Apartments.com alternative, Roomi, offers the following filters for your privacy and budgeting needs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Entire Place</li><li>Private Room</li><li>Shared Room</li></ul>



<p>However, while Apartments.com allows for filtering based on listing type, they are a tad harder to navigate and pin down. Cue lots of frustrated mouse tapping.</p>



<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/badi-alternative-choose-best-room-finder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meet Roomi: The #1 Badi Alternative To Find Rooms For Rent</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering Rooms Based on House Rules</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re a college student or ever were one, the mention of house rules might give you dorm room flashbacks. However, it&#8217;s important to remember that you&#8217;ll be staying in someone else&#8217;s property. For this reason, Roomi has a comprehensive checklist of house rules that you can tick off to lead you to your perfect room. Don&#8217;t want to bunk in a house that allows smoking? Tick! Want an en-suite bathroom? Tick!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Meanwhile, Apartments.com has the option to filter listings broadly categorised under &#8220;Lifestyle&#8221;. This limited list includes only five lifestyle options: Student, Short-Term, Corporate Housing, Military Housing, Senior Housing. Here, Roomi is the clear winner to find rooms for rent based on the nitty-gritty details that are important to you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No-Fee Apartments</h3>



<p>All listings are no-fee on the best room finder, Roomi. What does this mean? It means you can start browsing and viewing listings for free! Similarly, Apartments.com also offers no-fee listings. However, as we&#8217;ve seen above, Roomi&#8217;s comprehensive and thoughtful checklist makes the room finder the best Apartments.com alternative there is!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Are you looking to make some money on the side? Subletting is a wonderful way to establish a passive channel of income for yourself. However, the process is often tricky to navigate. Basically, you&#8217;ll be renting out a space within the space you&#8217;ve rented. This means that the subtenant signs a lease with you, rather than with your landlord. Fortunately, the best room finder Roomi makes subletting easy peasy, lemon squeezy!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which App Offers the Best Free and Paid Features?</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll come to find that Roomi offers free members a lot more than they would find on other websites such as Apartments.com. With Roomi, you can find rooms for rent for free! Want a little bit more? You can also unlock more features with affordable paid plans.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Free Members on Roomi:</strong> Free to download and sign up to activate listings for rent.</li><li><strong>Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription:</strong> The Gold Subscription is available at $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week. You can choose to pay monthly or weekly, depending on your budget.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s dive in to explore the free and paid plans on Roomi which make it the best Apartments.com alternative!</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p><strong>Roomi offers an easy way to find the perfect room for rent free of charge.</strong> It&#8217;s quick and free to post a listing, search listings, and contact two listings in any location Roomi covers. However, if you&#8217;re looking for more features, you might want to consider signing up to Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription. <strong>With Roomi Gold, here&#8217;s what you get:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings!</li><li>5 active listings to post all the empty rooms in your apartment.</li></ul>



<p>However, <a href="http://Apartments.com" class="broken_link">Apartments.com</a> is an online apartment marketplace of listings compiled from third-party portals. This makes advertising listings on the website complicated and expensive, with the possible threat of private information leaks.</p>



<p><strong>Ready to list a room with the best room finder, Roomi? Get started with the help of this <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44000214340-how-do-i-create-a-listing-" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">wonderfully easy guide</a>!</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-App Messaging</h3>

	</div>
	


<p>The powerful Aparments.com alternative allows you to message listings and set up times for apartment viewings, all for free! On Roomi, the free plan also lets you ask questions to get a better feel for the place you&#8217;re interested in.</p>



<p><strong>With Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription, you have access to the super helpful features below:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Access to unlimited messages with potential roomies. (On mobile, you also get unlimited swipes!)</li><li>A Fully Verified status upgrade which gets you 5x more messages!</li></ul>



<p>However, Apartments.com is a subsidiary of the larger corporation of CoStar. This means that your messages are routed to a third-party service provider. Websites like Apartments.com aren&#8217;t the best portals for in-app communication because they can compromise your cybersecurity. <strong>In this comparison, Roomi shines as the best room finder!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-listings-are-credible">Security: How Do These Apps Ensure That Listings Are Credible?</h2>



<p>Most websites like Apartments.com fall short of Roomi when it comes to vigorous data monitoring. Roomi thoroughly screens user profiles, encrypts your data, and deletes your account if you want them to.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi is committed to your physical and cyber security in three significant ways:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>ID Verification</strong>: Verifying accounts is a friendly way to make sure the person living in the apartment you’re about to rent from is credible. This account verification process includes providing a copy of your lease, utility bill, or government-issued ID.</li><li><strong>Location Protection:</strong> Roomi never shows your exact address on the platform. Instead, only your approximate location is visible to other users.</li><li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> The best room finder has a 24&#215;7 in-house content moderation team to weed out scammers and fraudulent profiles. Furthermore, if you&#8217;re having doubts about a listing or a user, you can always contact <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/home" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi&#8217;s support team.</a></li></ol>



<p>On the other hand, as mentioned above, Apartments.com is one of the brands under the major real-estate organization, CoStar. CoStar&#8217;s privacy policies clearly state that they might use your personal information for their third-party service providers. <strong>Therefore, when it comes down to your security while browsing rooms for rent, Roomi is the best room finder.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for a home, you want to feel safe and secure when sharing your information. Roomi grants you complete control of your data, while vetting listings rigorously. Ultimately, what makes Roomi the best Apartments.com alternative is the comprehensive checklist of features. You can filter based on amenities, pet-friendly listings, house rules, and so much more! <strong>Say hello to your new room genie, Roomi, and have fun browsing for your perfect room!</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-have-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What Filters &amp; Preferences Do These Room Finders Have to Help you Find your Perfect Room?</h2>



<p>Moving to a new city can be an overwhelming experience, but finding a room for rent shouldn&#8217;t be. Roomi&#8217;s algorithm is designed for you to find the room of your dreams, with basic filters such as location and price, and other advanced filters that suit your lifestyle. The powerful Zillow alternative has a comprehensive checklist that you can tick off to suit your preferences!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s find out how these room finders fare side by side.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-Friendly Apartments</h3>



<p>If you have a pet, you probably can&#8217;t imagine leaving your furry friend behind when you move to a new city. Luckily, both Zillow and Roomi offer pet-friendly apartment listings. However, Zillow only offers to accommodate cats and dogs. Roomi, on the other hand, has three different categories for pet-friendly listings &#8211; &#8220;Dogs OK&#8221;, &#8220;Cats OK&#8221;, and &#8220;Other Pets OK&#8221;. ****</p>



<p>So, whether you have a pet hamster or a pet tortoise, this great Zillow alternative lets you bring them along for the ride.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering Rooms Based on Amenities</h3>



<p>Do you want free Wifi included in your new rental? Would you love an on-site gym? Are you looking for a rental with its own security guard? With the best room finder, Roomi, your wishes will be granted! So, from elevators to private bathrooms, the powerful Zillow alternative makes your transition into your new rental easier.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Zillow also has advanced filter options, but they&#8217;re not as impressive or thorough as those on Roomi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering Rooms Based on Listing Type (Entire Place/Shared Rooms)</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re moving with your partner, you might want an entire place for privacy. If you&#8217;re looking to save money on rent, maybe you&#8217;d prefer a shared room. Whatever your preference might be, Roomi offers the following filter options based on listing type:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Entire Place</li><li>Private Room</li><li>Shared Room</li></ul>



<p>However, navigating Zillow&#8217;s rooms for rents based on listing types on Zillow is a little bit more complicated, giving Roomi the upper hand in this comparison.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering Rooms Based on House Rules</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that even if you&#8217;ve chosen to rent an entire place, you don&#8217;t own the rental. You&#8217;re living on someone else&#8217;s property and they might have rules that restrict your lifestyle. The best room finder portal, Roomi, has a simple and comprehensive checklist of filters you can tick off. For example, would you prefer living in a no-smoking apartment? Check! Do you want to live in a rental where you&#8217;re allowed to drink? Check!</p>



<p>However, Zillow doesn&#8217;t have the checklist feature of filtering rooms based on house rules. This is a clear disadvantage as compared to the best room finder, Roomi, because you have to manually input each keyword to narrow your search &#8211; which can be a tedious process.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No-Fee Apartments</h3>



<p>On Roomi, all listings are no-fee. What does this mean? You can start viewing and uploading listings for free! Zillow also offers the feature to browse listings for free. However, as we&#8217;ve seen above, Roomi is a wonderful Zillow alternative to find rooms for rent, providing all these extra features at no extra price!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Subletting is often tricky, because you&#8217;re renting a space to another person within the space you&#8217;ve rented for yourself. This means that the subtenant signs an agreement with you, rather than the landlord. Sounds complicated? Don&#8217;t worry, both Roomi and Zillow have simplified the process of subletting for their users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which App Offers the Best Free and Paid Features?</h2>



<p>The big move to a new city is expensive enough, especially if you factor in moving-in fees and setting up utilities. You don&#8217;t want to blow your budget by shelling out more money on a room finder portal. With Roomi, you can find rooms for rent for free, and also unlock premium features at affordable subscription plans!</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Free Members on Roomi:</strong> Free to sign up and activate listings for rent.</li><li><strong>Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription:</strong> The Gold Subscription is available at $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week. You have the flexibility to choose whether to pay monthly or weekly depending on your budget.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s dive in to take a closer look at what Roomi offers on their free plan compared to the Gold Subscription.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>On Roomi, you can post an advertisement for a place to rent completely free of charge! Similarly, it&#8217;s free to browse rooms for rent. On top of that, you can contact up to two listings for free in any of the locations that Roomi covers. If you want more features to narrow your search and find the perfect room, here&#8217;s what you get with Roomi&#8217;s Gold plan:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings.</li><li>5 active listings to post all the empty rooms in your apartment.</li></ul>



<p>On the other hand, Zillow now asks its members to sign up for their Zillow Rental Manager. Even though your first listing is free, this is only applicable to one account per household. After that, every other listing comes at a price of $9.99 per week. Unlike Zillow, the powerful Zillow alternative, Roomi provides a flat rate for a variety of extra features.</p>



<p><strong>List a room with the best room finder, Roomi, with the help of this <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44000214340-how-do-i-create-a-listing-">wonderfully easy guide</a>!</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-App Messaging</h3>



<p>You can message listings and set up times to view apartments for free on Roomi. The free plan also allows you to ask questions and get a better feel for the place you&#8217;re interested in. Additionally, if you&#8217;re looking for more features, here&#8217;s what Roomi Gold offers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Access to unlimited messages with potential roomies. (On mobile, you also get unlimited swipes!)</li><li>A Fully Verified status upgrade which gets you 5x more messages.</li></ul>



<p>However, Zillow does not have direct control over the communication between a listing provider and potential tenant, so there can be delays in communication. This leaves users at a greater risk of cybersecurity scams because of a lack of secure in-app messaging. <strong>In this comparison, Roomi shines as the best room finder!</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-listings-are-credible">Security: How Do These Apps Ensure That Listings Are Credible?</h2>



<p>Roomi’s reputation as the best room finder is in part thanks to its commitment to privacy and security. Roomi protects you and your information by keeping everything anonymous, not sharing info with other users or companies, encrypting your data, and deleting your account if you ask them to.</p>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s take a closer look below at how the best Zillow alternative protects you:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The verification of accounts is a user-friendly way to make sure the person living in the apartment you’re about to rent from is who they say they are. This verification process involves providing a copy of your lease, utility bill, or government-issued ID.</li><li>Your listing address isn’t visible on the Roomi app. Instead, only an approximate location is shown.</li><li>Roomi&#8217;s in-house content moderation team will review any listing or profile that violates community guidelines. Additionally, if you want to report users, you can contact Roomi&#8217;s trust and safety team.</li></ul>



<p>Zillow&#8217;s content moderation isn&#8217;t as rigorous as Roomi&#8217;s. However, the platform allows you to report possible fraudulent listings by clicking &#8220;Report Listing&#8221; on the page. In sum, this great Zillow alternative is committed to your physical and cyber security with strict guidelines and the instant reporting of scams.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?</h2>



<p>Each renter is unique and has different preferences when it comes to finding a new home. Roomi offers a comprehensive checklist, allowing users to filter rentals based on amenities, pet-friendly listings, and house rules. When choosing between room finders, you want to know that your information is safe and protected. This powerful Zillow alternative does this effortlessly, while making sure that you have fun searching for your new home!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re likely tired of searching Google for rooms for rent. Even if you&#8217;ve found some interesting leads on Craigslist or Facebook, maybe you&#8217;re not quite convinced. After all, moving to a new city and into your new home raises concerns not only about safety, but also the anxieties that come with independent living. You&#8217;ll also have your own personal preferences of location, price, pets, and so on. <strong>In this guide, we&#8217;ll walk you through the services offered by Roomi and how these compare to websites like Trulia.</strong> So, let&#8217;s get started on your journey to navigating the best room finder portal for you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-have-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What Filters &amp; Preferences Do These Room Finders Have to Help you Find your Perfect Room?</h2>



<p>We know that moving to a new city is a daunting experience in itself, so we&#8217;ve created the best room finder portal for you to <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44000214489-how-do-i-search-for-a-room-on-roomi-">match with the perfect room</a>. In order for you to find the room of your dreams, you need to be able to filter different features so that the best room finder can then pull up the listings that are most suited to you. As mentioned above, there are the basic filters of location and price, but Roomi offers so much more than that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-Friendly Apartments</h3>



<p>Both Roomi and Trulia offer pet-friendly listings. However, websites like Trulia do not have the additional filters of other pets — they only take into account dogs and cats. With Roomi, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you have a pet other than a dog or a cat because it has <strong>three filters for pets: &#8220;Dogs OK&#8221;, &#8220;Cats OK&#8221;, and &#8220;Other Pets OK&#8221;. Roomi makes sure that you don&#8217;t leave your best friend behind when moving into a new rental!</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering Rooms Based on Amenities</h3>



<p>Do you prefer a private bathroom? Is an on-site gym a must-have for you? With the best room finder portal, Roomi, you can expect all of your room wishes to be answered! Roomi has been designed to make the transition to a new home easy and fun for you. So, from elevators to private bathrooms and air-conditioning, Roomi has your back. Trulia also offers filtering rooms by amenities, but in comparison to Roomi, Trulia has fewer filters.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering Rooms Based on Listing Type (Entire Place/Shared Rooms)</h3>



<p>Would you prefer an entire rental unit to yourself or share a room to save money? Roomi offers you both options, and more! Trulia, and websites like Trulia, also allow their users to filter rooms by listing type. <strong>However, with Roomi you have three options to filter rooms based on listing type:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Entire Place</li><li>Private Room</li><li>Shared Room</li></ul>



<p>Trulia doesn&#8217;t fare well in comparison to Roomi because their listing types are a tad more complicated to understand and navigate than those you&#8217;ll find on the best room find portal, Roomi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering Rooms Based on House Rules</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Remember that you&#8217;re renting someone else&#8217;s owned property, so there might be a few rules in place already. So how do you find the best room for yourself amidst all these different house rules? Roomi makes this easy this for you — simply filter by house rules of no smoking, no drinking, couples OK, and so on! <strong>On the other hand, Trulia requires you to manually enter the house rules you would like to be implemented or avoid, every time you search, instead of providing you with a simple checklist like Roomi.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No Fee Apartments</h3>



<p>All Roomi listings are no fee. This means you can start viewing and uploading listings for free! Websites like Trulia also offer their users no fee listings. In the search for your perfect room, we at Roomi know that the best room finder portal must be cost-effective and informative!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Subletting is the process of renting one’s apartment or room inside a rental to another person for a set period of time. This is often tricky because the subtenant signs an agreement with you rather than the landlord. Sound complicated? Don&#8217;t worry, Roomi has simplified the process for you. Trulia, and other websites like Trulia also allow subletting services.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which App Offers the Best Free and Paid Features?</h2>



<p>Moving to a new city is expensive enough, but you certainly don&#8217;t want to break the bank on a room finder portal that exceeds your budget. L<strong>et&#8217;s take a look at how Roomi is the answer to all your room finder woes:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Free Members on Roomi:</strong> Free to sign up and list a place to rent.</li><li><strong>Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription:</strong> The Gold Subscription is available at $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week. You choose whether to pay monthly or weekly depending on your planned finances.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the features Roomi offers its users on the free and Gold subscription plans.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>On Roomi, it is free to post an advertisement for a place to rent. Senders can send up to two listings for free in any of the locations that Roomi supports. Likewise, it&#8217;s free to search for a place to rent. However, if users want better results, paying for Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription plan is recommended. <strong>With Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription plan, these are the listing features you will have access to:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings</li><li>5 active listings to post all the empty rooms in your apartment</li></ul>



<p>On the other hand, while Trulia is also free to use and download, users who have posted their Trulia review online <strong>mention that there is no way to directly list with Trulia. Websites like Trulia redirect their users to a third-party vendor for listings, which means that you have to keep switching apps and risk losing track of your room search.</strong></p>



<p><strong>List a room with the best room finder, Roomi, with the help of this <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44000214340-how-do-i-create-a-listing-">wonderfully easy guide</a>!</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-App Messaging</h3>



<p>You can send messages and view them for free on Roomi. Furthermore, Roomi&#8217;s free plan also allows you to ask questions and set up times to view apartments. And you can message any listing for free! <strong>However, if you&#8217;re looking for more features with regards to in-app messaging, here&#8217;s what Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription plan can unlock:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Access to unlimited messages with potential roomies. (On mobile, you also get unlimited swipes!)</li><li>A Fully Verified status upgrade which gets you 5x more messages.</li></ul>



<p>While Trulia allows you to contact agents for free and there no costs associated with using the app, <strong>it lacks advanced features. The most glaring disadvantage being that Trulia does not have an agent directory in-app, which means that you will not be able to contact real estate agents directly.</strong></p>

<p>Roomi&#8217;s reputation as the best room finder is in part thanks to its commitment to the privacy and security of its users. Roomi protects you and your information in the following ways:</p>

<p><strong>Trulia doesn&#8217;t offer the same rigorous content moderation, and as a result some of their users have complained in their Trulia reviews that the listings are often not very reliable.</strong> Nevertheless, Trulia&#8217;s public initiatives claim to vet new accounts and verify listings by ensuring the lister has a valid U.S. phone number and IP address.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Are you planning a big move in the near future? Whether you&#8217;re moving within the city, to a new one, or even to a different country, you&#8217;ve probably got a lot on your mind. First and foremost, though, has got to be the question of, where are you going to live? How does one go about finding the perfect place to rent? Well, there are Facebook pages and Craigslist ads that will help you find rooms for rent. There are also apps like RentHop and Roomi that will give you a host of options to choose from. But how do you decide which is the best website to use to find rooms for rent? Ideally, you want an app that&#8217;s going to help you find the safest option out there, and one that&#8217;s got all the amenities you need. In this article, we’ve compared RentHop to the best RentHop alternative, Roomi, taking into consideration features, pricing, and security, to help you decide which is the best room finder out of the two!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room"><strong>Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?</strong></h2>



<p>Safety&#8217;s got to be your #1 priority, but that&#8217;s not all you&#8217;re going to be looking for in a new apartment. You probably have a list of preferences as long as your arm, like the number of rooms you need, whether you’re willing to share with a roommate, what&#8217;s your preferred gender to share with, whether or not it’s pet friendly, and how close it is to stores, your workplace/school, etc.! The best website to find rooms for rent should help you filter your choices based on all of your preferences. We’ve looked at what apps like Renthop and Roomi offer below, so you know just what you&#8217;re getting from each of them!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No fee apartments</h3>

<p>RentHop partners with real estate agents to help you find rooms for rent. So, on this platform, you will find both fee and no fee apartments, but you can filter out the fee-paying apartments if you prefer. On the other hand, the RentHop alternative we’re looking at, Roomi, only lists no-fee apartments. Once you choose a listing based on the rent, that’s all you’ll be paying for it. There are no hidden fees to worry about!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>



<p>If you have a pet, you know they&#8217;re like part of the family, and you could never just leave them behind when you move. Some landlords allow pets in their buildings, but many don&#8217;t, so it&#8217;s important to check before you sign a lease whether or not pets are permitted in your new apartment. Both RentHop and Roomi let you filter your search by whether cats or dogs are allowed.</p>



<p>But, if you have an unconventional pet like a hamster and choose RentHop, you will need to contact the landlord directly to find out their stance on this. By contrast, Roomi has an additional filter, ‘other pet friendly’, to make your search quicker and more convenient.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>You can filter for sublets on RentHop. But to contact the person you&#8217;ll be subletting from, you will have to go through the contact form on RentHop&#8217;s website. On the other hand, the RentHop alternative Roomi allows you to contact the individual directly through the secure messaging service on their app. You can also ask potential roommates to complete background checks so you feel completely comfortable before agreeing to live with them!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>When you’re using apps like RentHop and Roomi, you’ll almost always be able to filter listings by houshold amenities. But this doesn’t mean they’ll have the same number of options. On RentHop, for example, you only have the most basic filters, like whether or not the rental is furnished, has in-house laundry, a dishwasher, private outdoor space, and a parking space. And that doesn&#8217;t seem like enough, right?</p>



<p>That’s why Roomi offers filters for everything from in-unit washers to whether there’s WiFi, air conditioning, and a 24-hour power supply. And keep in mind that these amenities are only a few out of 15+ options you can filter by!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type</h3>



<p>RentHop lets you filter through three listing types: exclusive, sublet/lease-break, and short term. Using a different filter, you can choose whether you want a studio, room, or a rental with a certain number of rooms. But, there’s only one filter – exclusive – that gives you information on whether you’re going to have roommates or not.</p>



<p>Here’s where Roomi steps in and steps up. You can filter by entire place, private room, or shared room. Using another filter, you can also choose your preferred gender of roommate, whether that’s male, female, or non-binary. You can also choose the preferred age bracket of your potential roommate! Need we go on?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>



<p>House rules are super important when you’re choosing a place to rent. After all, your rental is going to be the place you go to relax at the end of a long day. You want to be comfortable and unrestricted, even if you’re sharing this space with someone else. Unfortunately, RentHop offers no filter for house rules except for the pet policy. If you choose the RentHop alternative Roomi, you can choose from 11 filters for house rules that begin with no smoking and go as specific as being okay with dogs, cats, or other pets!</p>

<p>Bearing in mind all the expenses of moving to a new place, you’re probably wondering if you should pay extra for a room finder or save your money for rent. We’ve compared RentHop and Roomi on their subscription plans and what advantages you can gain by paying for a premium membership.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>RentHop allows you to post 1-5 listings on the basic plan. If you want to post more, you’ll have to opt for one of their three subscription plans – Silver ($69), Gold ($149), or Platinum ($199). Each plan gives you a certain number of ‘Pro Credits’ that you can use to activate more listings. The number of listings you can activate is also dependent on the plan you choose.</p>



<p>In the free version of Roomi, you can sign up and start postings listings without spending a cent. You’ll also be able to activate up to two listings on the platform. Roomi Gold, which is priced at just $29.99 a month, gives you five active listings and free bookings, which can help you save over $100 dollars! If you want a shorter subscription period, you can pay $14.99 a week for the same benefits. With all that information, Roomi is the clear winner when it comes to value for money!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-App Messaging</h3>



<p>RentHop allows you to contact landlords and sub-letters through a contact form on their website. This sets up an email thread between you and the lister through RentHop. Instead of messaging them directly on the app or the website, you’ll have to correspond via email.</p>



<p>Roomi allows you to contact listers directly on the platform itself, whether you&#8217;re on desktop or using the mobile app. You have five swipes and can send up to five messages per day if you’re on the basic plan. If you choose to subscribe to Roomi Gold, which is priced at only $29.99 a month (about a dollar a day!), you can send unlimited messages. And that’s not all you get! Roomi Gold also gives you a ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings, and you will have access to ID verification, which in turn will get you five times more messages.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?</h2>

<p>If you’re contacting listers through a room finder, you want to make sure the listings are credible. So, what security measures do these platforms take? Well, RentHop has algorithms and manual processes to verify listings that are posted on the platform. They also have information on what you can do to stay aware of online scams. The alternative to RentHop that we’re looking at here, Roomi, has a robust system put in place to verify their listings. There are three key steps taken to ensure your safety:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>All listers’ information is verified.</li><li>Listers can choose from three levels of ID verification, and their level is displayed to you.</li><li>Any discrepancies you find in the listings can be reported to Roomi’s 24/7 moderation team.</li></ul>

<p>When you’re deciding between ways to find rooms for rent, it’s important to weigh up the pros and cons of each room finder app and ask yourself some questions. Does RentHop give you everything you&#8217;re looking for? Does Roomi have more to offer? Which room finder ticks all the boxes for what you’re looking for? Once you have the answer to these questions, you’ll know which is the best website to find rooms for rent for you! And we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll agree with us that it&#8217;s Roomi!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Deciding on moving to a new place is a big thing for many people, whether you&#8217;re a college student looking for cheap rooms or a young professional starting a new career. As a result, many room finders are available online, but which one is best? Which one can you <em>actually</em> use to move? In this article, we&#8217;ll give you two options, Airbnb and Roomi (an <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/airbnb-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Airbnb alternative</a>!). We&#8217;ll talk to you about the app&#8217;s features, prices, and even their security! So, read on to find out which room finder is the best for finding rooms for rent in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?</h2>

<p>When choosing a room finder, you should consider the features and benefits available to get the most out of it. Below we&#8217;ve listed some of the key features that most people look for in a room finder, to help you decide between Roomi and Airbnb.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No fee apartments</h3>



<p>Having the option of no-fee apartments is unusual in most room finders. Fortunately, Roomi, the <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/airbnb-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Airbnb alternative</a>, offers plenty of no-fee listings to its users. This means that there aren&#8217;t any hidden or extra charges on top of your rent, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about going over your budget. In Airbnb, you have to pay a service fee of up to 14.2% of the subtotal for every confirmed booking.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-Friendly Apartments</h3>



<p>Finding apartments that allow pets is tricky and may even lead to disappointment. However, with Roomi&#8217;s pet-friendly filters, you may be surprised by how smoothly your room hunting can go! Just choose the filter according to which pet you have (a dog, cat, or any other pet!) and Roomi will show all appropriate listings. Airbnb has the same feature, but you aren&#8217;t able to choose what kind of pet you have. Without this clarity, you could face issues with your landlord when moving in or even be refused.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Both Roomi and Airbnb have worldwide subletting services available for their users, but what makes Roomi stand out is their quick and safe process. The <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/airbnb-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Airbnb alternative</a> provides complete background checks and has secure in-app messaging to ensure the safety of its users. Airbnb also conducts background checks but requires a service fee of 3% for all Airbnb hosts and more for Airbnb Plus hosts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>Looking for a new place to live online gives us the luxury to choose the amenities we want in potential properties. But unfortunately, not all room finders have the specific feature that fits your needs. With Roomi&#8217;s many filters, you can think of any amenity and this <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/airbnb-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Airbnb alternative</a> will make it work! From having a doorman to month-to-month listings, Roomi can cater to your needs easily. Airbnb also lets you filter results based on amenities, but their filters are largely limited to the appliances available.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type(entire place/shared rooms)</h3>



<p>In both Roomi and Airbnb, you can look for specific listings based on their types, like an entire place, a private room, or even a shared room. You can easily choose the filter that fits your needs and both room finders will show relevant listings to help you find a room for rent in your preferred city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>



<p>When it comes to finding a new place, house rules are an important factor that should be considered. Thankfully, Roomi and Airbnb both offer house rules filters, but Airbnb only has pets and smoking options. Meanwhile, <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/airbnb-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Airbnb alternative</a> Roomi, lets you choose whether you&#8217;re okay with drinking, drugs, and even having couples over.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?</h2>

<p>There are a lot of things to factor in when finding rooms for rent in NYC and the most pressing one is money. So, it&#8217;s vital that you use a room finder that is either free or charges a small fee to find everything that you&#8217;re looking for.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>In Roomi, all users have two free credits to create two listings or to activate any pending or deactivated listings. But you can easily purchase more if you feel like those aren&#8217;t enough with Roomi&#8217;s flexible credit plans. Plus, with a Roomi Gold subscription, that only costs $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week, you can get even more out of this <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/airbnb-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Airbnb alternative</a>! For one, you&#8217;ll receive a Fully Verified badge for your profile, have unlimited messages, get five more active listings (that are 7x more boosted!), and save on booking fees! In Airbnb, posting a listing is free of charge, but in some cases, renters may be subject to extra fees such as a service fee or host-only fee.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-app messaging</h3>



<p>Many websites like Airbnb have free in-app messaging, but how sure are you that your messages are kept safe and secure? Thankfully Roomi offers great security and free in-app messaging! You can message potential landlords or roommates within the app for free, without having to worry about your privacy. Airbnb also has in-app messaging, but you only can send a few messages daily.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?</h2>



<p>When it comes to room finders, it&#8217;s important to ensure that the app you&#8217;re using has credible listings and that your contact information is stored securely. That&#8217;s why Roomi, an <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/airbnb-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Airbnb alternative</a>, takes the extra step to make sure that all users are protected. This includes a thorough verification process (providing a copy of their lease, utility bill, or any government-issued ID) and hiding the exact location of listings. Similarly, Airbnb verifies and does background checks on its users for added peace of mind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?</h2>

<p>Both Roomi and Airbnb have many similar features, but which room finder is the best to use when finding rooms for rent in NYC? For one, Roomi has more specific filters when it comes to searching for listings and it will cost you way less when subletting and booking rooms. With Airbnb, on the other hand, there are extra charges and fewer filters to choose from.</p>



<p>With all these things considered, Roomi is the definitive choice when deciding which room finder to use. So, what are you waiting for? Download the app now and start the search for your ideal room!</p>

<p>The popularity of coliving has risen rapidly over the last few years. Coliving, in a nutshell, is when you share a living space with other people with shared interests.</p>



<p>There are multiple reasons why people choose coliving. It could be to combat loneliness, to build a professional network, or just to be part of a community. One of the prime reasons someone may choose coliving, however, is to cut down on rent and other living costs.</p>



<p>In a bustling city like San Francisco, for some, the rent costs can seem too high. If you also add the cost of utilities and food, there isn’t a lot of room left for other activities.</p>

<p>To maintain your lifestyle without compromising your savings, you may want to consider coliving in San Francisco over getting your own place. By opting for coliving, you get to meet different, like-minded people without long-term commitment.</p>



<p>The minimum stay period ranges between 30 to 90 days, with the option to extend. There&#8217;s also usually a great Wi-Fi connection, among several other benefits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whenever you ask someone where you can find rooms for rent, it&#8217;s hard for them to provide a clear answer. Some lucked out on Facebook, other found referrals through friends, and others may have braved the world of Craigslist. However, since these platforms aren’t room finding portals specifically, they don&#8217;t always cater to your needs. Here’s where room finder apps like Citru and a popular alternative of Cirtru, Roomi, step in.</p>



<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/roomi-hot-sicker-average-start/241/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi. Hot, Sicker than your Average Start-Up</a></p>



<p>Now, you may already be aware of room finding portals, but you&#8217;re on the lookout for the best room finder out there. Just going through tons of Citru reviews isn’t worth the time, it&#8217;s much better to compare it with a popular Citru alternative, Roomi!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?</h2>



<p>No one wants to scroll through listings endlessly when trying to find rooms for rent. The best room finder app should offer the ability to filter rooms according to your preference, for fast finding. Websites like Cirtru allow users to filter according to the price that fits their budget, type of accommodation and some specific requirements like pet-friendliness. However, when you’re trying to find the best room finder, having a few more filter option helps.</p>

<p>Here’s where Roomi proves to be a great <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/cirtru-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Cirtru alternative</a>. It not only allows you to filter rooms according to your budget and listing type, but it also has options to filter listings based on house rules like no smoking, vegetarian roommates and whether the listing is couple-friendly.</p>

<p>Roomi allows you to list your rooms for free. You can list an entire apartment or any room in your apartment that&#8217;s available. On this app, you can list up to two rooms in the same address for free.</p>



<p>Citru also allows users to list their rooms for free and indicate the number of available rooms.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Pet-Friendly Apartments</h3>



<p>Roomi allows users to browse and find rooms for rent that are pet-friendly. If you have a pet lizard, don’t worry! On the app, you can not only filter according to whether the apartment is cat or dog-friendly, but you can also filter according to an “Other Pets Allowed&#8221; filter.</p>



<p>Cirtru allows users to filter rooms based on whether they are cat or dog-friendly only.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Subletting</h3>



<p>On Roomi you get two listing credits for free, or you can buy up to fifty listing credits to list more rooms. You can also list more than one room as long as they are at the same address, so if you’re looking to sublet your apartment, Roomi’s a convenient app for you.</p>



<p>Cirtru also allows you to list multiple rooms in an apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>Need to ensure that your room has a desk or wi-fi? Roomi understands that everyone has unique needs, so they’ve made it easier for users to filter rooms based on the amenities they provide. You can not only find typical amenities like Wi-Fi and a fridge but other not-so-common amenities like meal provision and security features.</p>



<p>On Cirtru you aren’t able to filter rooms based on amenities, so if you have any specific needs you’ll need to read each listing carefully.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Filtering rooms based on Listing Type</h3>



<p>On Roomi, you can filter listings based on whether the entire house is for rent, or a shared room or single rooms are up for grabs. It’s easy to filter rooms based on what you need.</p>



<p>Users on Cirtru can browse through all listings or filter options where the entire house is for rent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>



<p>What makes Roomi a unique <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/cirtru-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Cirtru alternative</a> is that you can filter rooms based on house rules. From typical rules like no smoking or drugs, you can also select listings that have a no boys or girls allowed policy. For users who’re renting rooms for the first time, this feature helps them opt for listings they&#8217;re comfortable with.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?</h2>

<p>Roomi has a freemium as well as a paid plan &#8211; the Roomi Gold subscription. Users can get most of the required features for free, but enjoy more benefits when they opt for the paid plan. When you opt for the monthly Roomi Gold subscription for $29.99 you get a fully verified profile that people can trust, a listing boost and additional listing credits so you can list more rooms for rent.</p>



<p>Cirtru also has a premium plan for its users, which costs $29.99 and offers users a listing boost to help find roommates faster. However, there aren’t many other useful features that you can unlock with a paid plan, which is why users often look for better <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/cirtru-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Cirtru alternatives</a>.</p>

<p>When users opt for the Roomi Gold plan, they get 5 additional listing credits. These credits can be used to list up to 5 rooms within the same address. In case you need more, you can buy up to 50 <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002138584-what-are-listing-credits-" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">listing credits</a> separately.</p>



<p>Cirtru allows users to list the number of rooms they have for rent in their house or apartment.</p>

<p>Once you’ve subscribed to Roomi Gold, you unlock unlimited swiping and unlimited in-app messaging to various users. It’s easy to connect with users and get to know them, before making any commitments.</p>



<p>On Cirtru, you can send messages to users when you’re interested in their listing as well.</p>

<p>Wondering whether websites like Cirtru and Roomi are legit? Room finder apps need to provide a set of safety features to keep their users from falling for scams.</p>



<p>Roomi details how they ensure that <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44000214580-how-can-i-trust-that-listings-are-real-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listings on their website are credible</a>. This room finder app also uses a GlobalID to verify their users’ ID, which not only ensures the credibility of the user but protects their data as well. They not only have various verification levels but also have a 24 x7 in-house content moderation team that ensures that any scam or spammy listing is taken off the platform as soon as possible. In addition, users can easily report suspicious listings.</p>



<p>Cirtru requires users to verify their email address and their number when they’re listing a room. With Cirtru, reporting a listing is slightly more complicated as you can only report a lister once you’ve started a conversation with them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?</h2>



<p>Now that we’ve analyzed all features carefully, which one’s the <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/cirtru-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">best room finder platform</a>? It’s hard to choose between the two platforms as they both offer great features. Cirtru helps users list rooms for free, and connect with potential roommates through their secure in-app messaging. Have a read of Cirtru reviews and you’ll find most people are happy with the end result.</p>



<p>However, what makes Roomi a popular <a href="https://competitor.roomiapp.com/rooms-finder-compare/cirtru-vs-roomi" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Cirtru alternative</a> is that it offers all features that typical room finder platforms have, and more! You can not only filter listings according to the type, but also by amenities and house rules. For users who have specific needs, Roomi is undoubtedly the best place to find rooms for rent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Traveling is a fun, exciting experience, whether you’re going solo or with a group. If you’re exploring new cities and countries, it’s even more so! Imagine this scenario: your trip has been planned for only a few days, but you reach your destination and fall in love. Now, you find yourself planning to move there. Suddenly your priorities change from looking for famous sights to finding a place to live!</p>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re a digital nomad or plan to put roots down, it’s important to find the perfect place to live. If you’re on holiday, a nice place at a cheaper price is always an advantage because you’ll have more money to spend on food and sightseeing! But, if you’re moving to a city permanently, you&#8217;ll have other costs to worry about like utilities, food, and so on!</p>



<p>So, which is the better option &#8211; living in a hotel or renting a room? Let’s start off by exploring the pros and cons of living in a hotel&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-and-cons-of-living-in-a-hotel">Pros and Cons of Living in a Hotel</h2>



<p>The easiest way to make a decision is by looking at the advantages and disadvantages you’d face with each property. If you choose a hotel, you’ll have comfort in the form of room service and someone to carry your bags. On the other hand, you&#8217;d likely end up spending more!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-of-living-in-a-hotel">Pros of Living in a Hotel</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-convenience">1. Convenience</h3>



<p>As is the norm when you book a room at any decent hotel, you’ll have the convenience of various different services. The most common one is room service – you can order food and beverages directly to your room. You can also ask the housekeeping team to give you clean bedsheets and towels, every day of your stay. Some of the fancier establishments may also have a laundry service that you can use at an extra charge.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-meet-other-travelers">2. Meet other travelers</h3>

<p>Whether you’re booking a room for a few days or several months, you’ll have the opportunity to meet many interesting people. If you enjoy socializing and networking but work remotely, staying at a hotel is a great way to meet international travelers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-central-location">3. Central location</h3>



<p>Maybe the biggest advantage of living in a hotel instead of renting a room is location. You’re more likely to find a hotel in the city center, right at the heart of everything! This is perfect for those of you who require connectivity for work. hotels often utilize advanced <strong><a href="https://www.techimply.com/software/hotel-management-software" class="broken_link">hotel management software</a></strong> to enhance the guest experience. Software such as RoomRaccoon, Cloudbeds, and Hotelogix ensure efficient operations, seamless booking processes, and personalized services, making your stay not only convenient but also comfortable.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cons-of-living-in-a-hotel">Cons of Living in a Hotel</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-more-expensive">1. More expensive</h3>



<p>When you compare the price of living in a hotel for a week vs renting a room, you’ll realize just how much more you’ll be spending on a hotel! Sure, a hotel room may come with room service and housekeeping. But, you’re sure to find cheap rooms for rent that come equipped with a washing machine for your laundry. And room service? How likely are you to order in from your room when you have all those new restaurants and cuisines to explore? Not very likely &#8211; are we right?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-less-space">2. Less space</h3>



<p>If you rent a room in an apartment or even an entire place to yourself, you won’t be restrained by space! You’ll also have the freedom of treating your rented place like your own. This is especially advantageous if you’re staying for a longer period of time &#8211; as is access to a kitchen. Some places even come equipped with a balcony or patio so you can entertain guests outdoors!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-crowded-noisy-locations">3. <strong>Crowded, noisy locations</strong></h3>



<p>Hotels are targeted towards people who want to be in the center of the city. If this doesn&#8217;t sound like you, you can find quieter, more peaceful options if you rent a room. This way, you can choose the accommodation that is away from the hustle and bustle for a more relaxing stay. Plus, you can find cheap rooms for rent that are priced low because they’re away from the main tourist area.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-living-in-a-hotel-room-or-renting-a-room">So, living in a hotel room or renting a room?</h2>



<p>At the end of the day, it comes down to two things. First, how much money you’re willing to spend and second, how much time you’ll be spending at your accommodation. That said, no matter whether you like to be out and about or just by yourself, renting a room has several advantages! You&#8217;ll have more freedom, more space, and more amenities! And the best part is, finding a room is not very difficult.</p>



<p>By using a room finder like Roomi, you can find a budget-friendly place more quickly and easily. All you have to do is sign up and start looking. With rooms for rent in every major city, lots of amenities to choose from, and the option of whole places, rooms, or shared digs, we&#8217;ve got all bases covered. Happy room hunting!</p>
