<p>Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic started, face masks have become an indispensable part of our lives. Be it going to work or a quick grocery run, masks are now at the top of our checklists when we leave home. Our lives have changed in many unexpected ways, and preventing the spread of COVID-19 with face masks is one of them. Breakouts and skin issues from wearing face masks have become so common that mask acne has even been dubbed &#8216;maskne&#8217;. As the name suggests &#8211; acne around the mouth and chin caused by wearing a face mask. Since we’re going to be wearing masks for a while, managing and preventing maskne will be our top priority! So for all you looking for maskne tips &amp; maskne treatment you&#8217;re in the right place!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What causes mask acne?</h2>



<p>Whether you’re blemish-prone or have more of a sensitive skin type, the problem is twofold: it’s both the humid conditions beneath your mask’s material <em>and</em> the physical contact of the mask itself that can cause problems. These dreaded breakouts tend to develop when pores get clogged up by bacteria, oils, dead skin cells, makeup, and dirt. This can then lead to whiteheads, blackheads, or pimples that vary in size and type.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are some Maskne tips to prevent a breakout?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Step no.1 in maskne treatment is to invest in the right mask!</h3>



<p>A cotton mask is a good option as it allows your skin to breathe while protecting others around you. Cotton is a soft, natural, and breathable fabric as opposed to synthetic fabrics such as nylon, polyester, and rayon, which are more likely to cause irritation.</p>



<p>A good fit will not only help to protect you and others from Covid19, but also prevent you from having to constantly readjust your mask. This reduces the spread of bacteria to your face and stops it from rubbing continuously against your skin.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Good skincare is a good maskne treatment</h3>



<p>A simple skincare routine can go a long way toward keeping your skin clear. Consider mask wearing a good excuse to adopt the most basic skincare routine: a gentle non-soap cleanser and a mild, fragrance-free moisturizer. Stick to a gentle cleanser and light moisturizer, and use products that are fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and oil-free. If you’re spending any time in the sun, don’t forget to use a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day. This is one of the most important maskne tips to prevent a breakout.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Break up with excessive makeup (at least temporarily!). If you put on makeup for a video call, consider taking it off when you go out.</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Wear a soft, cotton, or homemade mask that fits your face properly.</li><li>Do not touch or itch your face once you wear a mask.</li><li>Use a protective cream or a barrier cream like sunscreen or a mild moisturizer before wearing a mask.</li><li>If you’re wearing a cotton mask, be sure to wash it frequently with warm water and gentle detergent. This will help remove oil and dead skin cells that can collect on the inside of the mask.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3.<strong> Avoid reusing surgical masks</strong></h3>



<p>So, if you keep your masks clean, follow daily proper skin hygiene, and use the appropriate products, you should be able to control any skin irritations and acne while continuing to protect yourself and others from the virus.</p>
