<p>More gender-neutral housing options are gaining popularity to cater to a more inclusive group of accommodation seekers. With these welcome changes, it has become easier to find mixed-gender housing today. If you are looking for a safe space that is inclusive of all genders, gender-inclusive housing can be great! Here is all you need to know about all-gender housing and if it is the right choice for you.<br></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-gender-neutral-housing"><strong>What is gender-neutral housing?</strong></h2>



<p>Gender-neutral housing or gender-inclusive housing is a type of accommodation that can be shared by residents of any gender. A lot of housing can be gender-specific (male/female) and can be challenging for those who do not fit into the<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary#:~:text=Gender%20binary%20(also%20known%20as,social%20system%20or%20cultural%20belief." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gender binary</a>. Therefore, neutral housing makes an inclusive option for non-binary renters. All-gender housing is great for those who may not feel comfortable or don&#8217;t prefer a same-gender-only accommodation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-gender-neutral-housing-only-for-lgbtqi-residents"><strong>Is Gender-Neutral housing only for LGBTQI+ residents?</strong></h2>



<p>No! Gender-neutral housing is for anyone who would like to live in a space that is not limited to one gender. If you are comfortable with mixed gender and inclusive space, you can consider gender-inclusive housing as an option! The whole goal is to provide a space for people who prefer a gender-neutral accommodation. This could be because you do not identify with the gender binary or a personal preference.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-i-live-with-a-romantic-partner-in-gender-neutral-housing"><strong>Can I live with a romantic partner in gender-neutral housing?</strong></h2>



<p>Well, that&#8217;s complicated. While you technically can share gender-neutral housing with a romantic partner, it is generally discouraged. On one hand, you do have a right to privacy and can live with a romantic partner. However, this can be a problematic situation in many cases and be unpleasant for you and other residents. For instance, other residents may feel uncomfortable sharing their space with a romantically involved couple. On the other hand, live-in relationships can be a big step for a couple, and one that you may not be ready for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros-and-cons-of-gender-neutral-housing"><strong>Pros and cons of gender-neutral housing</strong></h2>



<p>There are probably more benefits to all-gender housing, especially if you prefer a mixed-gender space. However, here are some of the things to keep in mind to decide whether gender-neutral housing is right for you or not.</p>

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros"><strong>Pros:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Gender identity goes beyond the gender binary, and traditional accommodation can exclude many. Gender-neutral housing recognizes the complexity of all gender identities and provides a space for it.</li>



<li><strong>Diversity:</strong> All-gender housing allows you to interact with a diverse group of people. This means you can learn about gender identities and expressions in an inclusive space. Interacting and living with a mixed group of different genders can help you gain new perspectives. Hence, you can gain deeper insights and grow as an individual.</li>



<li><strong>Safe Space:</strong> An all gender housing can be a safe space for LGBTQI+ residents to discuss their opinions and issues. A more inclusive and accepting environment can make it easier to relate or be heard and understood. Being able to interact with your peers comfortably means this type of housing can be a safe space for non-binary residents.</li>



<li><strong>No pressure!</strong> Some non-binary individuals may not identify with any particular gender or maybe still discovering their identity. Gender-neutral identity does not force you to state or disclose your gender. Hence, this option respects their privacy and gender identity. </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cons"><strong>Cons:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Though increasing in popularity, not all Colleges or places have gender-inclusive housing options. Even in places where it is an option, the capacity of mixed-gender housing facilities can be limited. Hence, the availability of gender-neutral housing can be an issue with waiting lists for some.</li>



<li><strong>Comfort-zone:</strong> Some people may not be comfortable with sharing spaces and living in close proximity with people of other genders. Having to live with people of other genders may not suit some people. In cases like this, you may be better off looking for same-gender accommodation instead.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Staying indoors for too long has made us all dream of seeking more in the outside world when we can finally be out there again. Maybe it&#8217;s a hobby or a skill you&#8217;re aiming to work on and develop. Or if you&#8217;re looking at public universities in New York state for college degrees, we definitely feel you! Although, learning a skill or picking up a hobby doesn&#8217;t come with a high cost, getting a degree does! So if you have decided to enroll yourself in college, we&#8217;re proud of you and we wish to help! Here&#8217;s all you need to know about the costs of public colleges in New York.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First thing&#8217;s first: Is public college free in New York?</h2>



<p>In brief, it&#8217;s a little complicated.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, public colleges in New York became much more accessible with the rollout of the Excelsior Scholarship program. The program proposed to cover four years of tuition. That too, without being tethered to academic performance at public universities in New York state.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/12/free-college-now-a-reality-in-these-states.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC reported</a>,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>The scholarship applies to all schools and public colleges in New York and State University of New York. The government stated that more than 940,000 middle-class families and individuals making up to $125,000 per year will qualify when the program completes its three-year phase-in in 2020. However, you should keep in mind that the program does not cover the cost of books or room and board, and other <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-you-should-know-about-living-with-roommates-in-college/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living</a> expenses.</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some of the requirements that make you eligible for the Excelsior scholarship are:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>You need to be New York state residents.</li><li>As a student, you should attend a SUNY or CUNY two- or four-year program at public universities in New York state.</li><li>You need to take 30 credits per calendar year (including January and summer sessions).</li><li>You should plan to live and work in New York following graduation. And for at least as long as the time you participate in the scholarship program.</li></ul>



<p>For a more detailed view of requirements, you can visit <a href="https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/financial-aid/types-of-financial-aid/nys-grants-scholarships-awards/the-excelsior-scholarship/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">NYC&#8217;s government website</a>.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/04/08/pf/college/new-york-free-tuition/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN reported</a>,</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Okay, but how is it complicated?</h2>



<p>Well, like everything else, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-live-life-to-the-fullest-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the pandemic</a> has complicated all the areas of our collective lives!</p>



<p>The Excelsior program was a program that filled students with hopes for a cheaper public college education in New York. But sadly, according to the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation, which runs the state’s Excelsior Scholarship, the pandemic has caused a dramatic reduction in state revenues and, as a result, the processing of new applications has been delayed since April 2020.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what are other options for financial aid at public colleges in New York?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">FAFSA</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/heres-how-to-get-more-financial-aid-for-college-amid-the-pandemic.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">As per CNBC</a>, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, serves as the gateway to all federal money, including loans, work-study, and grants, which are the most desirable kind of assistance. For the 2021-2022 school year, the FAFSA filing season opens Oct. 1 — and, for the most part, the sooner students file, the better.</p>



<p>In addition, keep in mind that financial aid for public universities in New York state is calculated based on a family’s income from two years earlier. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Student loans</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve all seen the memes and talk in the media about student loans and the misery of it. But if your desire for education at public colleges in New York is insurmountable. And if you plan your finances and future prospects well, you can consider this as a good option. The most important first step being, to educate yourself all you can about the options available and how you can get the best value out of them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/learning/student-journey/college-and-career-planning/paying-for-college" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the NYC school government website</a>, here are some things you should keep in mind.</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Before you sign for any loan, make sure you ask questions. Find out when you or your family must start paying the money back and how much interest you will have to pay. Ask your college and career counselor at your school or a financial aid officer for help if you do not understand the loan documents.</li><li>You can also visit an&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/consumers/get-free-financial-counseling.page" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYC Financial Empowerment Center</a>&nbsp;for free 1:1 financial counseling.</li><li>A <strong>Direct Subsidized Perkins Loan</strong> is a Federal student loan that has a lower interest rate. Students do not have to start paying this loan back until after they graduate from college. However, students do have to start paying if they decide to leave school.</li><li><strong>Federal Direct Plus Loans</strong> for parents have higher interest rates than Direct Subsidized Loans for students. Additionally, the loan accrues interest right away, and a credit check is necessary to apply.</li></ul>



<p>And last but not least, here&#8217;s a <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">helpful government website</a> to know your options for public colleges in New York. All you have to do is go to the webpage and type your desired college or field of study. It will give you details on the colleges and public universities in New York state to help you decide which one&#8217;s the right fit for you!</p>



<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Beginning college is both an exciting and nerve-wracking experience. For many, college is the first time living away from home and taking on new responsibilities. Some even learn how to do laundry for the first time in college!</p>



<p>However, the biggest concern that’s on most freshmen’s minds is, how am I going to live with a roommate?</p>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-tips-for-living-with-an-international-roommate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">For the majority of college freshmen, their first year at school is their first time coliving with another person</a>. The prospect of living with a stranger can stir up feelings of both nervousness and excitement. What if I don’t get along with my roommate? What if they don&#8217;t like me?</p>



<p>Have no fear, here are a few tips and tricks to know before meeting your college roommate to put your mind at ease!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Utilize your Residential Assistant</h2>



<p>The majority of colleges have a Residential Assistant (RA) on each floor of freshman housing. RAs are upperclassmen that live on your assigned floor and are there to help you with the transition to college life. That being said, you must utilize your RA as much as possible; they are there to help, after all!</p>



<p>Be sure to introduce yourself to your RA on move-in day so you know who they are and they know who you are. Your RAs are there for you if you have any questions or concerns about classes, adjusting to campus life, schoolwork, etc. They are also there, most importantly, to help you with your adjustment to coliving with your roommate (or roommates!)</p>



<p>If you have any concerns about your roommate or are having a hard time adjusting to coliving with another person, have a chat with your RA to see if they can offer you any advice. All RAs were college freshmen once, too, so they know exactly what you’re going through.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choose random roommate selection instead of rooming with someone you know</h2>



<p>If you’re going to a college where you have friends or know people there from high school, choose a random roommate selection instead of rooming with someone that you know. This may seem counter-intuitive, but it will help you in the long run.</p>



<p>First, rooming with someone you don’t know will help you to meet new people! It may not be the most comfortable choice at first, but it will help you to expand your circle and make new connections. After all, how will you get to know other people if you don&#8217;t connect with others outside your friend circle?</p>



<p>Next, rooming with someone you don’t know will also help to push you out of your comfort zone. It may be awkward living with a stranger at first, but it will help you to gain confidence and it will prepare you for the real world. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/5-things-totally-miss-roommates/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Who knows, you and your roomi may even become BFFs!</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You may not be best friends with your roomi right away, and that&#8217;s okay!</h2>



<p>As an incoming college student, it’s important not to put too much pressure on your potential roommate relationship. Of course, it would be fantastic to be best friends with your roomi on day one; however, that may not always be the case.</p>



<p>Your roommate doesn’t have to be your BFF, and it may take some time to build a solid relationship with your roomi. Everyone has their own unique personality, and some individuals may take longer to become comfortable with living with a roommate. As long as the two of you are respectful of one another and communicate with each other, you should have a solid roommate relationship!</p>



<p>Remember that if you ever have any issues with your roommate or if you’re thinking of switching to a new roommate, talk to your RA. Sometimes it’s better to face problems head-on and to work your roomi issues out yourself!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>College is an extremely pivotal point in a young person’s life. Therefore, it is important that you take the time to pick the right school for you! New York is home to some of the top liberal arts schools in the country. It is also home to numerous liberal arts schools. If you’re looking for a smaller college, choosing a liberal arts school may be the best fit for you! If you’re looking for some small liberal arts colleges in New York, this list could be very helpful!</p>



<p>What&#8217;s special about liberal arts schools in New York, or elsewhere is that they have fewer students compared to public universities. The class sizes are smaller and as a result, students get more individualized attention from professors. Even though liberal arts colleges are smaller than universities, they still have all the traditional aspects of college such as clubs and Greek life.</p>



<p>Searching for a college and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/how-to-make-your-profile-stand-out-on-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planning for your future career</a> can be overwhelming.

There is a ton of uncertainty in the workforce right now, so try not to panic if you haven’t found a job yet.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dear class of 2020, allow yourself a break.</h2>

<p>First of all, give yourself a break and stop stressing! If you have recently graduated college or are graduating this year, don’t feel pressure to find a job right away. Many college grads take time off after graduation before their next endeavor, whether that’s graduate school, traveling, or entering the workforce. You don’t need to have your life figured out by your early 20’s!</p>



<p>While living at home, be sure sure to check in on your mental health. This is a stressful time for everyone, and we all <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-covid-essentials-to-keep-at-home-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cope with the stress of the pandemic differently. </a>It is important to take care of our minds and check in with ourselves every once in a while. You&#8217;ve got this!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Class of 2020 or not, don&#8217;t forget to enjoy the time you have at home.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/cameo-graduation-graduate-class-of-2020-inJNMiGqM1CBAigtK1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/inJNMiGqM1CBAigtK1/giphy.gif?resize=360%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="High School GIF by Cameo - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="360" height="480" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Think about it: when will be the next time you’ll be living at home with your family? We&#8217;ve seen so many college grads moving back home due to the pandemic, and worrying about losing that taste of independence once again.</p>



<p>Try to view living at home as a positive instead of a negative! For one, you’ll save a ton of money since you won’t need to worry about rent or other expenses. Second, you can also enjoy time with your family. Cherish the time you have living at home and try not to view it as a setback.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep building your resume!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/IntoAction-Srzor6ErxsOCXt9Pv4"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/Srzor6ErxsOCXt9Pv4/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="Graduation GIF by INTO ACTION - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="480" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Just because you’re living at home doesn’t mean you can’t keep adding to your resume. If you’re currently unemployed and aren’t having much luck finding a job yet, do other activities that you can put on your resume.</p>



<p>There are many opportunities for online volunteering that you can do during COVID-19, which is a great thing to add to your resume. If you have a lot of free time on your hands, take online classes that are useful for the career that you want to go into. Don’t feel stuck and instead view this as a time of opportunity!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep your search on, and your head held high.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/moodman-2020-Tjjr8OXolrue0evTMx"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/Tjjr8OXolrue0evTMx/giphy.gif?resize=278%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="2020 GIF by MOODMAN - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="278" height="480" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Don’t lose hope! Make sure to keep applying to jobs that you’re interested in even if you’ve faced multiple rejections. You never know when you might get an acceptance. In addition,<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/top-tips-for-professional-growth-in-2021-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> keep doing research about possible jobs within the career field that you want to go into.</a></p>



<p>Use LinkedIn and connect with college alums in order to get more information about the job that you’re striving for. If you’re really feeling stuck, reach out to your college’s career services office and speak with them. Your college is still there to help you even after you’ve graduated!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Going off to college is both an exciting and nerve-wracking experience. It can be hard to figure out what to bring and what you will actually use while at school. There’s no need to feel overwhelmed; here&#8217;s a list of essential items to bring to college that will make your life easier and keep your dorm room organized.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. A mattress pad is on top of our essential items list!</h2>



<p>Most dorm rooms come with a twin XL mattress that isn’t always that comfortable. Be sure to bring a mattress pad so your bed is cozier and you can happily sink into it after a long day of classes! <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/7-storage-hacks-that-will-transform-your-home-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bring a throw blanket and extra pillows in order to make your dorm room feel homier!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. A trunk</h2>



<p>This is a must and perhaps one of those essential items in our list that you shouldn&#8217;t skip. Freshman dorm rooms are often limited in the amount of space that is available. Bringing a trunk to store extra clothes or other items will help you if you run out of space. To maximize your dorm room space, raise your bed frame so you are able to put your trunk and other items &#8211; such as storage bins &#8211; underneath. This will make your room look less cluttered.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Drawer dividers</h2>



<p>Dorm rooms usually have one large dresser, so clothes can easily get messy inside. Bringing drawer dividers will help to maximize your space as well as keep your clothes organized. For all of you wondering &#8211; &#8220;why are drawer dividers in an essential items list?&#8221; Well, friends if you like rummaging through a messy drawer to find your stationery and glasses like ATT &#8211; these dividers are surely not for you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. A mini-fridge (if you&#8217;re possessive about your snacks add this to your essential items) </h2>



<p>Don’t forget this! A mini-fridge is an essential item to bring to college to store drinks and snacks. You will want to have a place to store food in case you don’t feel like going to the dining hall (and to avoid the risk of your snacks being stolen). If possible, make sure to get a mini-fridge with a freezer. This way you will have ice to keep your water cold.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. A shoe rack</h2>



<p>Bringing a shoe rack is another way to help keep your dorm room clean and organized. A shoe rack helps to maximize your closet space and makes it easier to get ready in the morning. If your dorm room has a closet, tuck your shoe rack inside to hide it away and save space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6.Command strips/hooks</h2>



<p>If you want to hang up string lights, posters, a tapestry, or pictures, you should definitely bring command strips and hooks. This is an easier and cleaner way to decorate your room without having to use a hammer and nails &#8211; which you could get in trouble for! Using command strips or hooks will also make moving out less of a hassle.</p>
