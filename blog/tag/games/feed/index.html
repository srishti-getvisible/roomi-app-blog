<p>Those evenings with roommates when everyone is home but separately scrolling through Instagram, sending each other memes while in the same room, is in the past. Do something fun together that engages everyone and make a memorable night out of it. Your board game /card game session could even become a roomies’ tradition!</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/7-tips-for-getting-along-with-a-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bond with your roommates</a> with these fun board games and card games. We assure you these won’t end up in escalated, lasting tension like after those Monopoly and Uno game nights!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Pictionary</h2>



<p><strong>Players: 2-4 teams</strong></p>



<p>You don’t have to be a good artist to play Pictionary, because that’s where half the laughs lie! Within a minute – as a sand timer keeps time – the “picturist” must draw what the card they pick says and the teammates must guess it. The time limit really tests your creativity, which only results in more laughter. The most popular Pictionary board game makes some of the turns more challenging with levels of difficulty and rounds like “All Play,” but you can find other versions too.</p>
