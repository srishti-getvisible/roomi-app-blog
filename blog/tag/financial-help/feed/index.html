<p>Can&#8217;t stop singing &#8216;money, money, money, must be funny, in a rich man&#8217;s world?&#8217; And has it become the unwanted background song in your personal life&#8217;s feature film, as you make a plan to ask your parents for money? We feel you!</p>



<p>At some point or another in our lives, we&#8217;ve all had to come face to face with the nasty inevitable: Being broke!</p>



<p>Maybe you&#8217;re in college and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/managing-personal-finance-by-sticking-to-your-budget-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">have overspent your budget</a>. Or maybe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5ya3ou/millennials_of_reddit_ages_1834_how_much/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">you&#8217;re a millennial</a> and need to ask your parents for money to work on a brilliant business idea. No matter what your reason, the conversation about asking your parents for money can fill you with dread.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re seriously broke and are down to your last few funds, it might be giving you the palpitations. You might have come to the conclusion that you&#8217;ll have to ask your parents for money sooner rather than later. And procrastinating about this will only make you suffer more.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s get down to the nitty-gritty! Here are some ways to ask other family members or parents for money when you run the risk of going broke.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Make an acceptance speech about your flaws </h2>



<p>So you&#8217;ve decided to ask your parents for money? Then you&#8217;ll have to get ready for a lecture that is rightly in order. But here&#8217;s a way to combat the shame. Go over your spending habits and recognize and accept your failures when it comes to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/the-importance-of-personal-finance-management-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">handling finances responsibly</a>. </p>



<p>So when you ask your parents for money, tell them that you know what your faults are. Add to it the many ways you&#8217;ve devised to work towards correcting them in the future (and mean it). Being tough with yourself now could help you control your spending habits in future.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ask the right relative or parent for money</h2>



<p>The kind of person you choose to ask will make or break this deal. If you&#8217;re thinking of asking someone that has already been struggling with their finances, you should probably drop the idea. If they do lend you some despite the fact, you&#8217;ll just end up causing unwarranted stress for them. So observe your family members to spot the richest (and most generous) one.</p>



<p>Another point to keep in mind is you should look for someone whom you trust and who trusts you. Don&#8217;t ask a relative who already bugs you about your lifestyle choices! Make sure the borrowing and lending act doesn&#8217;t create an unnecessary rift between you two.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:72%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l3q2PZSVUUEsajBIY" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2PZSVUUEsajBIY/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Ask parents for money to fulfill needs, not desires</h2>



<p>Are you asking your parents for money to indulge in luxuries or go on a trip you can easily postpone? Then forget about it. Adulting includes its share of sacrifices and requires you to make lifestyle choices within your budget. Even if they do lend you some, you won&#8217;t be able to learn the lessons that being broke teaches you! As a result you&#8217;ll always end up resorting to ask parents for money when you&#8217;re in need.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re struggling to cover basic necessities, then you should ask your parents for money. Give them a breakdown of how much you need and where their loan will go if you get it. The more sincere you are, the more your parents, siblings, or relatives will understand.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Try the written word to ask parents for money</h2>



<p>If you can&#8217;t bring yourself to verbally ask your parents for money, and your mouth seals shut whenever they start talking about how responsible you&#8217;ve become, try the written word. Pen out a sincere handwritten letter, email, or a long text message about <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/tips-to-manage-your-finances-without-stressing-out-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your financial worries</a>. Tell them why you need it and how you&#8217;re working to<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> make your financial planning better.</a></p>

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/efyEShk2FJ9X2Kpd7V" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/efyEShk2FJ9X2Kpd7V/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Suggest a good repayment plan on your loan</h2>



<p>Just because you&#8217;re asking your parents for money, you shouldn&#8217;t try and get a free pass for the repayment of a loan. Suggest a reasonable tenure and a repayment plan &#8211; with interest if necessary. This will show that you&#8217;re ready to be responsible. And that becoming broke right now is a hiccup, not your way of life. Ask them for their suggestions and pen it out with your signatures to make it official.</p>

<p>Most NYC renters are familiar with the challenges that come with paying rent on time. In between trying the city’s newest restaurants and rooftop bars, prioritizing our finances can feel like a fine art. One that can take <em>a lot </em>of discipline. And most youngsters don&#8217;t stop and think how their decisions could impact their credit score. Here’s the bad news- the ramen and the Bloody Marys are gonna have to wait. Because late rent payments affect your credit score!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>So, what if your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-late-paying-rent/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate is late paying rent</a>, or if you’re falling behind on your own payments? Does this really have an impact on your credit score? Here’s what you need to know about sticking to the agreed-upon payment schedule.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-to-your-credit-score-if-you-don-t-pay-on-time">What happens to your credit score if you don’t pay on time?</h2>



<p>Right now, on-time rent payments don’t positively add to our credit score, while late payments can negatively affect our score. Seems a bit unfair, right? That’s why city comptroller Scott Stringer has been fighting to <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/making-rent-count/overview-rent-credit/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make rent count</a>; arguing that renters should be allowed to add rent payments to their credit history, in the same way that home owners do for mortgage payments.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:76%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3orifboWZvOhWnYRvq" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3orifboWZvOhWnYRvq/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>While it might not seem like a big deal if you miss one or two rent payments, there could be some consequences further down the line:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-late-fees">1. <strong>Late fees.</strong></h3>



<p>If your rental agreement includes a late fee clause, then expect to part with a few extra dollars if you’re late. Check your agreement, since the cut-off time could be a few seconds, or you may receive a grace period of a day or two. Either way, aim to pay on time every month, because paying the fee doesn’t automatically clean up your rental history.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-rental-applications"><strong>Future rental applications.</strong></h3>



<p>When it’s <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-signs-time-move/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">time to move into a new apartment</a>, your future property manager will want to know about your track record. They might use property management software or might contact your current landlord, but late payments are a red flag and could get in the way of being accepted to your new dream place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eviction-risk"><strong>Eviction risk.</strong></h3>



<p>Eviction laws vary by state, but you could find yourself with a <em>notice of termination for cause </em>in your hand, signifying the start of the eviction process. In such a case, you’ll usually be given a set number of days to pay the rent in full. If you fail, you might be kicked out &#8211; which has a <em>huge </em>impact on your credit score.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-poor-credit-score"><strong>Poor credit score.</strong></h3>



<p>If your property management company reports late payments to credit score companies, your score will be impacted.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-credit-matter-anyway">Why does credit matter, anyway?</h2>



<p>Your credit score is kind of like your passport to the consumer economy; a good credit score is your ticket to securing <a href="https://www.wagedayadvance.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">payday loans</a> and mortgages in the future, when you need them most. Those with a low credit score (or missing one completely) could find themselves paying extra on their phone contracts, insurance and credit cards interest rates.</p>



<p>You could notice both short-term and long-term consequences, with late payments staying on your credit history for as long as seven years!&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can request your <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit reports online</a>, to make sure yours are looking healthy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-you-can-t-pay-rent">What if you can’t pay rent?</h2>



<p>Repeatedly missing payment deadlines is a big no-no, but we’re all human and sometimes the unexpected happens. If you expect that you’ll be short on funds for an upcoming rent payment, there are some things you can do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talk to your property manager about short-term cash flow issues. Let them know the date you can make payment (as long as it’s only a few days after the deadline). They might just be able to let it slide &#8211; just this once. Remember, though, this isn’t the case for everyone. The best approach is to create automatic monthly bank transfers, so you don’t need to remind yourself to pay every month.</p>



<p>If this is an ongoing issue and you’re struggling to pay rent more than once, it’s time to make a change. Consider taking on an extra roommate, looking for a new source of income or moving to a more affordable pad.</p>
