<p>In 2020 Jacob and his friend rented a studio apartment somewhere in Los Angeles. When the lease ended in 2021, Jacob and his friend waited for his landlord to communicate the additional amount they now needed to pay to stay in the same apartment. But they never heard about the rent increase from the landlord.</p>



<p>If you’re a tenant in L.A. and wondering if there will be a rent hike at the end of your lease period, know that landlords in L.A. are now prohibited from raising the cost of more than 650,000 rent stabilizes units citywide. If you live in Los Angeles, know that there will be <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2022-01-03/even-in-hot-market-most-l-a-tenants-wont-face-rent-increases-for-at-least-another-year" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">no rent hikes for L.A. tenants until 2023</a> and possibly beyond. That&#8217;s not all. Los Angeles has important complex tenant laws. Knowing them well before moving into the city can help you save money on rent. Read on to learn about rent control in Los Angeles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-rent-control-laws-in-los-angeles">What are rent control laws in Los Angeles?</h2>



<p>In Los Angeles, the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) is a law that restricts the rent amount a landlord can charge from a tenant. It also limits the reasons for eviction. The law is enforced by the Rent Stabilization Board (RSB) of Los Angeles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-do-you-need-to-know-about-rent-stabilization-in-los-angeles">What do you need to know about rent stabilization in Los Angeles?</h2>



<p>A rental unit in Los Angeles might be subject to the <strong><a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/los_angeles/latest/lamc/0-0-0-195151" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">city’s Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO)</a></strong>, which protects tenants from unfair rent hikes and evictions provided the unit is built on or before October 1, 1978.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-rent-control-work">How does rent control work?</h2>



<p>Rental control in Los Angeles means a cap on the annual rental increase on units. So if you’re a renter in L.A., you can usually expect a rent rise between 3 and 8 percent annually.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-things-you-should-know-about-rent-controlled-apartments-in-los-angeles">Key things you should know about rent-controlled apartments in Los Angeles</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Landlords need to give at least 30 days&#8217; notice before a rent increase.</li><li>Tenants can expect a 1% increase in rent every year for all the utilities that the landlord pays.</li><li>Landlords cannot increase the rent more than once every 12 months.</li><li>If the rent increases, landlords are free to raise the security deposit</li><li>If you’re going to have an additional roommate who was not on the original lease, the landlord may raise the rent by 10%. But if a roommate who was initially in the lease moves out, the landlord needs to reduce the rent by the same amount.</li><li>The landlord is bound to pay relocation assistance for no-fault eviction where the tenants have no fault. The amount may range from $8,500 to $21,200. The exact amount depends on the reason for eviction, the tenant’s income, and the duration of the tenancy.</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-areas-in-los-angeles-have-rent-control">What areas in Los Angeles have rent control</h2>



<p>The law covers Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Inglewood, West Hollywood, and some unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-your-apartment-falls-under-the-rent-increase-law-in-los-angeles">Is your apartment falls under the rent increase law in Los Angeles</h2>



<p>If you live in a unit built before October 1, 1978, it is covered by RSO. Mobile homes in parks are also covered under this act. To know when your apartment was built and if it’s covered under the rent control in Los Angeles, check with the <a href="http://zimas.lacity.org/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">city’s property database</a>. You can find the information with just a few clicks. Know that even if your building meets all the specifications, it might be prevented from being covered by the RSO. This may happen under certain instances:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The unit is a government-funded property.</li><li>It is a luxury apartment.</li><li>The unit was completed after 1978</li><li>You live in a single-family home, and it’s the only building on the property</li><li>Hotel and motel rooms occupied for less than 30 days</li><li>Commercial buildings that were converted to residential buildings after October 1, 1978</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="do-rent-control-laws-in-los-angeles-allow-eviction">Do rent control laws in Los Angeles allow eviction?</h2>



<p>While living in rent-controlled apartments gives protection to a certain extent to tenants, however, you can still be evicted. Under rent control in Los Angeles, evictions are allowed in the following situations:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Creating a nuisance</li><li>Subletting the unit to someone else illegally</li><li>Causing damage to the property</li><li>Not paying rent</li><li>Not obeying the rental agreement</li><li>Using the rented property for illegal activities</li><li>Failure to provide the landlord with reasonable access to the property</li></ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="benefits-of-staying-in-a-rent-controlled-apartment-in-l-a">Benefits of staying in a rent-controlled apartment in L.A</h2>



<p>Apart from protection against unjustified eviction or increased rent, you may receive 1% interest per year on your security deposit if you live in a rent-controlled unit for at least a year.</p>



<p>You can also file a complaint if you find your apartment is in an inhabitable condition or if there is an overcharge of rent. In such a scenario, you will be entitled to the reduced rent.</p>



<p>If the building is inhabitable and the landlord doesn’t rehabilitate it, the city can take over the building in rare extreme cases. You’re also eligible for reduced rent, and the city will restore the apartment to a livable condition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rent-control-in-los-angeles-amidst-covid-19">Rent control in Los Angeles amidst COVID-19</h2>



<p>While landlords generally raise rents between 3-8 % annually, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has changed the scenario. After the 2020 pandemic, the mayor’s emergency order mentions that no landlords can increase the rent. However, they can charge a new rent once the tenant vacates and the new tenant moves in. This has been a historic decision, marking the first time in more than four decades under the rent control law in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>However, even with the rent freeze, many tenants in L.A. have suffered significantly in the last two years. While a handful of the white-collar employees have managed to work from home, the scenario is entirely different for the lower-income workers – especially in the hospitality and leisure industry. While the low-income tenants are eligible for rental assistance for $5.2 billion in federal funding to pay previously owed and future rent, there remains a high demand for assistance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Having a roommate can be awesome! From helping you to save money to becoming a good friend and making your home a more enjoyable place to be, you hit the jackpot when you find a good roomie. But when things go wrong, it can feel like hell. Unfortunately, you can’t just evict a roommate in California. In some cases, it’s not possible to do so at all.</p>



<p>It all comes down to your unique situation and what your roommate may have done. If you do have a good reason to evict a roommate, you have to know how it works. You don&#8217;t want to find yourself on the wrong side of the law, even though you&#8217;re in the right.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-kind-of-roommate-can-you-evict">What Kind of Roommate Can You Evict?</h2>

<p>If your roommate is on the lease agreement with you, then they only answer to your landlord. Even if your roommate is not on the lease but pays rent directly to your landlord, you still cannot evict them. Even if they&#8217;re guilty of roommate harassment, the best you can do is report them to the landlord. However, your landlord can&#8217;t evict anyone without a just cause, such as causing damage or refusing to pay rent.</p>



<p>If your roommate is a subtenant (meaning you sublet your apartment out at a cost), then you can evict them. Of course, you still have to follow due process as your landlord would.</p>



<p>If you have a guest that has stayed in your apartment for more than 30 days, then they have become a &#8216;<a href="https://www.talkovlaw.com/tenancy-at-will-termination/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenant at will</a>’ and you can&#8217;t just throw them out, either.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-do-you-evict-a-roommate-in-california">How Do You Evict a Roommate in California?</h2>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Any eviction process must begin with a written notice according to the <a href="https://www.sb-court.org/self-help/landlord-tenant/landlord-tenant-action" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenancy law in California</a>. The notice must specify how many days the tenant has until you will terminate the tenancy. If there’s a reason for the eviction, you must also specify this in the notice.</p>



<p>If the culprit had signed a written sublease agreement with you, and there is a just cause, three days quit notice will suffice. If the person has stayed with you for up to a year, even without a lease agreement, you must provide a rent notice of at least 60 days. If it is less than one year, you’ll need to give at least 30 days’ notice.</p>



<p>Either you or your agent must serve this notice of eviction, in line with the law. If you choose to evict a roommate without sticking to the roommate&#8217;s law in California, your case may get thrown out of court.</p>

<p>You need a good, approved reason to evict your roommate in California, but there are some ways you can get rid of a bad roomie according to the roommate law in California. If, for example, you are pursuing eviction and plan to give 30 or 60 days’ notice, you don&#8217;t need to provide a good reason. However, if you&#8217;re aiming to evict someone within a shorter time frame, then you need to be able to justify your position.</p>



<p>If you’re subleasing to a roommate, you can evict them in California much more quickly &#8211; especially if there&#8217;s a history of bad behavior. Specifically, you can evict with only three days notice and have the backing of the law to pursue eviction if your roommate is guilty of any of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Refusal to pay rent</li><li>Violating the lease agreement in any way</li><li>History of roommate harassment</li><li>Damaging the property and utilities</li><li>Disturbing other tenants</li><li>Using the unit for an illegal activity</li></ul>



<p>Make sure you have a reason before expelling anyone from your apartment. The law mandates that eviction shouldn’t be a way to retaliate or discriminate against an individual.</p>

<p>So you&#8217;re tired of your roommate and even after serving them notice, they won&#8217;t budge. What can you do? You certainly can&#8217;t just change the locks on the door. You&#8217;ll end up with a fine.</p>



<p>If you’re evicting your roommate for a just cause and they rectify their behavior, they can stay. For example, if your roommate decides to pay all owed rent, you’ll have to accept the rent and move on. However, if they’re still being difficult, you can move forward with the eviction.</p>



<p>In that case, if the notice period expires and the roommate doesn’t budge, you must file paperwork in court to start an <a href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/unlawful-detainer-lawyers.html#:~:text=In%20real%20estate%20law%2C%20an,required%20to%20vacate%20the%20premises.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlawful detainer suit</a> against your roommate.</p>



<p>Once in motion, your roommate may choose to respond to the court in an attempt to fight the eviction. Nonetheless, the court will set a trial date within 20 days from when you get the notification. Usually, it&#8217;s a judge-only trial. If you win the case, the sheriff will give your roommate a notice of five days to move out. If they need to stay longer, they can file a stay of execution with the court to request more time.</p>

<p><strong>Ocean Ave, Santa Monica, CA 90401</strong></p>

Do you want to revisit the city&#8217;s landscape through a tourist&#8217;s eyes? Regardless, Palisades Park deserves a spot on your checklist of things to do in LA! For history buffs, you&#8217;ll find a Civil War cannon within the park. For art enthusiasts, the impressive Statue of Santa Monica by Eugene H. Morahan stands tall. However, if you’re just looking to kick back, soak in the shade of the palm trees, and enjoy the ocean breeze.</p>

<p>Go Get Em Tiger&#8217;s a third-wave coffee chain that has earned household name status, with seven locations across Los Angeles. That&#8217;s your cue to add GGET to your list of the best coffee shops in LA. GGET features an assortment of brunch pastries and espresso drinks made from coffee beans from Ethiopia, Mexico, and Colombia. Grab a drink if you&#8217;re on the run, or enjoy a meal while taking in their shop&#8217;s funky interiors. Their Santa Monica branch also counts as an outdoor coffee shop since it has patio seating. Must-try: their turmeric almond macadamia latte.</p>

<p>Cognoscenti Coffee Bar, founded by Yeekai Lim, started as a pop-up in 2009. Its first store opened in 2012 in Culver City, and since then, it&#8217;s expanded with two more locations. You can find them at DTLA South Park and in the Fashion District, too. Loyal customers consider them one of the best coffee shops in LA because of every cup&#8217;s clarity and sustainability. Not everyone&#8217;s into experimental drinks, so Cognoscenti&#8217;s perfect for you if you want your regular, no-nonsense latte, brew, iced tea, or americano. Order for pick-up from any of their branches on their website.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a cause to support, check out Silverback Coffee of Rwanda, founded by Rwandan native Jack Karuletwa. Silverback uses African beans for their roasts and donates to conservation efforts for Rwanda&#8217;s endangered Silverback gorilla. You have to try their cold brew and nitro offerings, and their turmeric ginger latte and lavender fog latte. They have lots of yummy brunch items too, like the chipotle chicken panini and soy chorizo breakfast wrap. It&#8217;s one of those restaurants in LA you&#8217;ll find yourself coming back to. Find them in Echo Park along Sunset Boulevard.</p>

<p>Civil Coffee is one of those cafes in Los Angeles where you can take IG photos all day. They&#8217;ve got an interesting mix of textures: mosaic tile flooring, marble walls, wooden tables, and an industrial-looking facade. The brightly lit interiors and pastries on display make the space totally inviting. Customers keep coming back for their Figueroa, made with cinnamon, espresso, milk, and sweetened condensed milk, topped with a Maria Cookie. Sink your teeth into their chilaquiles, burrito Angelinos, and barbacoa burrito for some hearty grub. &nbsp;If you want to dine al fresco, there&#8217;s a roomy patio in the back.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a reason why people line up outside Intelligentsia Coffee &amp; Tea, one of the best coffee shops in LA. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s one of the pioneers of craft coffee in LA. Which means they know how to make a mean cup of joe. Intelligentsia takes pride in its single-origin coffee from Guatemala, Mexico, and Ethiopia, among others. Try their signature Angeleno drink and black cat espresso. They also have loose leaf teas and milkshakes, making it a perfect pit stop for families. No wonder they&#8217;ve got a massive following of more than 186,000 on IG. They&#8217;ve got five locations in LA alone and six more in Chicago.</p>

<p>Los Angeles is the choice destination of many in California. The City of Angels is a melting pot of culture, attracting a diverse range of people from all over the world. It&#8217;s also the entertainment capital of the world, with Hollywood at its heart, and houses about 4 million people in total.</p>



<p>When you consider its good weather, scenery, and the numerous opportunities it offers, it&#8217;s easy to see why many dream of living in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>However, before moving to Los Angeles, there are a few things that you need to know about the city. Read on to explore ten key things about living in LA to help you make the most of your stay.</p>

<p>Most places have four different seasons. But in Los Angeles, it’s either the wet or dry season. The wet season runs from November to March and the dry season from April to October. August is the hottest month with an average high of 85 degrees. On the flip side, December is the coldest with an average overnight temperature of 48.</p>

<p>Ride-sharing apps have become popular around the world. And if you&#8217;re living in LA, you&#8217;re most likely familiar with Uber or Lyft. This is because roads can get very crowded and busy in Los Angeles, and most people don&#8217;t like the stress of driving. If you&#8217;re one of those people, then you want to know whether it&#8217;s better to use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles. These apps have similar features regarding their prices, mobile application usage, and safety measures. However, they do bear a few significant differences. Let&#8217;s find out what they are.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="let-s-talk-about-these-apps">Let&#8217;s talk about these apps</h2>



<p>Uber first started in 2008, through the initiative of Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick. The aim of the company was to reduce the cost of direct transportation. Since its inception, Uber has grown in its services and is available in over 900 metropolitan areas.</p>



<p>Founded in 2012, Lyft was adopted from a company known as Zimride. Lyft now operates in all 50 states in the US.</p>



<p>Uber first started out as a luxury car service. According to reviews by drivers, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Uber-and-Lyft-1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">more business people tend to use this service</a>. Lyft, on the other hand, has been described as being a more <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-general-which-is-more-trustworthy-Uber-or-Lyft" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">customer-oriented and engaging service.</a></p>



<p>That being said, let&#8217;s dive right into whether you should use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-is-uber-cheaper-than-lyft">Pricing: Is Uber cheaper than Lyft?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re living in Los Angeles, you&#8217;ve probably wondered, &#8216;Is Uber cheaper than Lyft?&#8217; These two ride-hailing apps are popular in LA, but most potential riders would prefer the cheaper option. Typically, pricing for both apps depends on demand and traffic at the requested time. Fees such as minimum fare, duration rate, booking fee, surge pricing, and more are charged by both Uber and Lyft. This means that in the aspect of pricing, Uber and Lyft don&#8217;t bear much difference.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="uber-s-unique-riders-feature">Uber&#8217;s Unique Riders&#8217; Feature</h2>



<p>The Uber and Lyft mobile apps let you see the driver&#8217;s picture before pickup, so it&#8217;s easy for you to identify that it&#8217;s the right driver.</p>



<p>Some riders prefer peace and quiet during rides, and it may be awkward if their driver is the talking type. This is why Uber has provided a feature that lets the driver know you don&#8217;t want to talk ahead of time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="booking-rides">Booking Rides</h2>



<p>If you want to choose between Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles, you&#8217;re probably looking for which one has better rides. Unlike taxis in LA, there are a lot of ride options to choose from for each ride-sharing app. However, in terms of variety, Uber tops the list. It has 13 primary services, with the most popular ones being UberX, Uber Pool, and Uber Comfort.</p>



<p>Though Lyft provides rental cars on the app, Uber wins this round as it shines in terms of its extensive services. Uber has more eco-friendly and luxury ride options than Lyft does. For example, Uber Green is a sustainable ride option that lets you request a ride in an electric or hybrid car. With UberLUX, you can request a high-end luxury sedan and ride in style.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="safety">Safety</h2>



<p>Some reviews have shown that there have been cases of safety problems for both companies. Several security measures have been put in place by both apps, such as sharing your location with a third party, viewing the driver, and vetting drivers thoroughly. However, Lyft, unlike Uber, has put in place a compulsory safety education program for its drivers. They also run annual background checks on their drivers. So, if you&#8217;re living in Los Angeles, Lyft is probably the safer option for you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="customer-service">Customer Service</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re wondering whether to use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles, then you&#8217;ll want to consider how good their customer service is. Uber and Lyft both provide customer service communication options in the form of emails, contact forms, FAQs, and webchat. There are also customer service representatives on standby for users to address issues.</p>



<p>However, comparing <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.uber.com?aspects=customer+service&amp;stars=5" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">riders&#8217; reviews</a> on customer service for both companies, Uber has the upper hand.</p>



<p>One Uber rider said, &#8220;Customer-oriented company. Thanks for your customer service.&#8221;</p>



<p>Another stated, &#8220;I recently made a complaint about an Uber driver for the first time and just wanted to note how pleased I am with the&nbsp;<em>customer</em>&nbsp;<em>service</em>&nbsp;team who responded immediately not only by email but also telephoned me to enquire further and apologize. You never think anyone takes note of these things especially complaints but this was handled perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ease-of-use">Ease of Use</h2>



<p>Both Uber and Lyft have mobile apps, and it&#8217;s easy for users to set up accounts and request rides. The apps let you choose your current location, destination, and also allow you to track your driver&#8217;s movements as they head to your location.</p>



<p>Lyft goes a step further and allows customers to sign up on a desktop web browser. They both have sleek, modern designs and are simple to navigate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="subscription-plans">Subscription Plans</h2>



<p>Uber and Lyft care for their customers and have put in place distinct subscription plans to honor their most frequent riders.</p>



<p>Uber&#8217;s special plan is called Uber Pass and grants users airport pickups, free Uber Eats deliveries on certain orders, a 10% reduction on certain premium rides, and more, for $25 a month.</p>



<p>Lyft, on the other hand, dubbed its subscription plan Lyft Pink. For $19.99 a month, users get perks like free scooter rentals, unlimited bike rentals, a 15% discount on all rides, and more.</p>

<p>Transportation in LA might not be a breeze, but apps like Uber and Lyft help to make things easier. People are different, and while some may prefer Uber over Lyft and vice versa, they are both great ride-sharing apps with different features that make riding easy.</p>



<p>So, should you use Uber or Lyft in Los Angeles? If safety is more important to you, choose Lyft. If having more options available is important, choose Uber.

Well, read on for seven things you should know about winter in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles weather overall is uncharacteristically warm because of its sub-tropical climatic conditions. What does that mean for you? If you were moving to LA in the summer, you might’ve had to deal with super-hot temperatures sometimes touching 100°F. That, coupled with the sweat from moving boxes would’ve put you in a very sticky situation (literally)! But luckily for you, sub-tropical climate = mild winter in Los Angeles! Even December, which is the coldest month in Los Angeles, experiences an average low of about 48°F.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-it-can-still-get-warm-in-winter">2. It Can Still Get Warm in Winter</h2>



<p>The winter in Los Angeles lasts from December to March and although it’s usually kind of mild, it can also get very hot because of the Santa Ana wind. Bringing in hot, dry weather, the Los Angeles weather can even go as high as 86°F on the days that this wind blows over the city. Be careful if you live near wooded areas, because these hot winds have been known to trigger fires.</p>

You can expect thronging crowds in all parts of the city, but more so in particular areas that have tourist attractions set up.

<p>Even though the weather is generally mild and sunny, you can experience some bouts of terrible weather. And by this, we mean heavy rains that could dampen whatever plans you had that day. A coat to keep you warm and dry, and a cup of something hot, should be enough to get you through!</p>

<p>Moving to the city just before winter in Los Angeles? You&#8217;re in luck! Winter is a perfect time to get outdoors and explore the city.</p>



<p>Here are a few things to do while you enjoy the Los Angeles winter weather:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Hike up to Hollywood</strong>: What better way to enjoy the lovely weather than by going on a hike up to the Hollywood Hills? Winter is off season for hikers, so you’ll enjoy a relatively uncrowded trail! The view of the landscape from the top, especially during sunsets, is something to definitely watch out for.</li><li><strong>Visit theme parks</strong>: There are three major theme parks you can enjoy during the winter season. If you’re travelling with a family, you’ve got Disneyland. If you’re the adventurous type, then Six Flags Magic Mountain has a whole bunch of rides for you! And lastly, if you’re in the city of Hollywood, you should definitely go to Universal Studios for the movie-themed rides. Keep in mind that Thanksgiving and Christmas can get busy, but if you can deal with crowds, you’ll get a special treat alongside that fuzzy, holiday feeling!</li><li><strong>Visit the zoo</strong>: The Los Angeles Zoo is one that is renowned all over the world. For three months every year, from November to January, you can experience a magical winter at the zoo. Decorated all Christmassy with lights and animal sculptures, it’s definitely a treat for the senses! The coldest month in Los Angeles will be just a little cozier when you&#8217;re surrounded by families and the warmth of the festive spirit!</li></ul>

<p>Just because it’s going to be mild-weathered during winter, doesn’t mean you can’t visit places around LA to enjoy the holiday spirit! Here’s a short list of places you can hit up:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Pinos</strong> &#8211; Mount Pinos gets several inches of snow every year and is ideal for you if you enjoy snowshoeing and skiing.</li><li><strong>Snow Valley Mountain Resort</strong> &#8211; About an hour away from LA, this resort is a top skiing destination. Less explored than other popular spots, you can enjoy a variety of ski slopes.</li><li><strong>Palm Springs</strong> &#8211; Even during the hot winds of winter, Palm Springs makes a great getaway if you want mild hiking weather. You can also go camping, hiking or fishing!</li><li><strong>Los Angeles Beaches</strong> &#8211; Beaches are a hot destination during the summer months but they&#8217;re perfect for a quiet escape during winter. With few tourists and locals, you can take full advantage of the space!</li><li><strong>Descanso Gardens</strong> &#8211; Visit these beautiful gardens for a unique light display during Christmas! You&#8217;ll also be closer to nature and may sight some lovely birds and mammals.</li></ul>

<p>Tenants have a right to clean, livable housing, and landlords are required to maintain livable units. This implies that doors and windows must be in working order and there must be hot and cold water. Furthermore, the roof and walls should keep out water. Additionally, no vermin should run free in the building or unit. <strong>Basically, &#8220;tenants have a right not to live in slum housing,&#8221; as stated by the Housing Rights Center.</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely not &#8211; unless it&#8217;s an emergency, in which case they don&#8217;t need to give you notice. For example, if there is a fire or flood, the landlord can enter without letting you know first.</p>



<p><strong>However, as per the renter&#8217;s rights in Los Angeles, all non-emergent landlord visits must be duly informed 24-hour prior to visitation</strong>. Furthermore, the landlord can come only during normal business hours. During outside hours, they are supposed to let you know in advance that they will be coming for repairs or showings.</p>

<p>Can your landlord raise your rent? If yes, how often? The rise in rent depends on local laws and ordinances as well as if you live in a rent-controlled home or a non-rent-controlled unit.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rent-controlled housing allows only one annual rent increase. As of July 2021, the percentage <a href="https://www.aaoc.com/news/calculating-your-next-rent-increase##" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase rate is 5%</a> for Los Angeles County.</li>



<li>For non-rent-controlled housing, which is 15-years-old or older, landlords can’t raise the rent more than twice in a year. Moreover, they can’t raise the rent by more than a <a href="https://www.aaoc.com/news/calculating-your-next-rent-increase##" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">total of 5 percent</a>, in addition to the Consumer Price Index rate for your metro area (it&#8217;s 3.3 percent for LA and Long Beach).</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the same trend as above, rent-controlled housing offers more protection to tenants, especially when it comes to no-fault evictions. Essentially, if the rental property is damaged in any way that wasn&#8217;t the tenant&#8217;s fault, the renter&#8217;s rights in Los Angeles will protect you from being evicted unlawfully.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>So, what can you be evicted for in a rent-controlled housing unit?</strong> There are a limited number of reasons including but not restricted to &#8211; failure to pay rent, violation of lease agreement, using the rental unit for illegal activities and so on. The full list as mandated by the LAHD is <a href="https://housing.lacity.org/rental-property-owners/tenant-is-at-fault-for-eviction-owners" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">here.</a></li>



<li><strong>Do the same rules apply to non-rent-controlled housing?</strong> Unfortunately, if you don&#8217;t live in a rent-controlled housing unit, there are fewer restrictions on evictions. However, tenant protection in LA is offered through the state&#8217;s new rent-cap law that demands that a landlord must give just cause for eviction.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-low-income-renters-living-in-la">5. Low Income Renters Living in LA</h3>



<p><strong>As of January 2020, tenant rights in Los Angeles demand that landlords be equally welcoming of renters who use Section 8 vouchers.</strong> It&#8217;s now illegal for landlords to deny renters access to their housing units just because low-income renters pay their rent with the aid of federal programs. <strong>This particular section of renter&#8217;s rights in Los Angeles is an important step forward to ensure that low-income tenants find safe housing to help them keep out of homelessness.</strong></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a leaky pipe or a broken window that wasn&#8217;t your fault, and your landlord isn&#8217;t coming around to fix your problem. In this case, what can you do?</p>



<p><strong>You can escalate your request in 3 steps:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, if there is a problem and your landlord is unresponsive, try to communicate with them verbally. This way you can find out if the matter can be sorted internally.</li>



<li>However, if your landlord still hasn&#8217;t come around to address your concerns, start a paper trail. What does this mean? A dated letter detailing the issue, timestamped pictures of the problem, and other documentation that could later be used, if needed, to show that your landlord was aware of the issue.</li>



<li>Lastly, if the above steps don&#8217;t work, you can <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://housingapp.lacity.org/ReportViolation/Pages/ReportViolation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">report a code violation</a> to the Housing and Community Investment Department (HCID). This falls well within your renter&#8217;s rights in Los Angeles.  </li>
</ol>
