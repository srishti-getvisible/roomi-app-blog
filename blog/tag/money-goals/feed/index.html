<p>Setting goals is proven to be an essential factor in finding success, and this applies to all aspects of life. So naturally, when it comes to money-making, setting your financial goals can help you prioritize! It can give you a clear idea of how and why you’re saving your hard-earned money. Your money goals can be anything–from getting out of debt to investing in real estate &#8211; it’s simply what you want to be able to do with <em>your</em> money!</p>



<p>Setting goals is one thing, but transforming those dreams into reality is another!</p>



<p><strong><em>These tips will help you set up a doable plan for all your money goals in 2021!</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set a target date for your money goals.</h2>



<p>Financial goals are typically categorized in three different ways. You have short-term, mid-term, and long term financial goals.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Short-term financial goals: six months to five years</li><li>Mid-term financial goals: five to 10 years</li><li>Long-term financial goals: more than 10 years</li></ul>



<p>Being specific helps, even if you adjust the date over time. Set aside time every few months or before the new year to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-personal-finance-mistakes-to-avoid-at-all-costs-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">determine what you want to focus on</a> in the coming one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Your money goals need a financial plan.</h2>



<p>A financial plan is a document that details how you plan to reach your financial goals. Your plan takes everything about your life into account, from your marital status to your career goals.</p>



<p>Your financial plan should always begin by answering the question, <em>“What do I want my life to look like X years from now?”</em>. It can be tough to figure that out, so give yourself time to think.</p>



<p>Once you’re clear on that, you can create a feasible roadmap for your finances to support your desired lifestyle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Setting a budget is the easiest hack to achieving financial goals.</h2>



<p>Setting a budget allows you to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-ways-to-ask-parents-for-money-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise discipline</a> when it comes to how much of your money is going to be spent on necessities, recreational expenses, or savings and investments.</p>



<p>By setting a budget (and sticking to it!), you’ll be able to better control how you are able to reach your other financial goals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Along with a budget, create goals for your savings.</h2>



<p>Take the time out to set a savings goal for the year. Your savings goal should be attainable yet as large as you can manage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get your credit in check! </h2>



<p>Get a handle on what your credit score is and the factors that are affecting it. If your credit score ends up being lower than you would like it to be, begin taking steps to improve it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you don&#8217;t know where to start, start with a side hustle.</h2>



<p>Your financial goals shouldn’t just be about spending money &#8211; or saving it. It could also be about actually making more money. How could you achieve that? Perhaps by starting a side hustle!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research and see where you can grow towards your money goals.</h2>



<p>Take some time to research companies to invest in. 2021 might just be an amazing year to get amazing deals, so when the market plummets, you&#8217;ll want to be ready to take advantage of the fire sale.</p>
