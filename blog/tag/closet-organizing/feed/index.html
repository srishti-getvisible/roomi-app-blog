										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are officially reaching the first anniversary of Coronavirus lockdown. By now, you surely have cycled through all the comfy casual clothes in your wardrobe closet. Perhaps it was hours of being stuck inside our homes, or maybe the unlimited Marie Kondo binge-watching. We are all craving better organization at home. And what better way to use your quaran-time than through DIY closet organizer hacks?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Before we give you those DIY closet organizer hacks&#8230;</strong></h2>



<p>Before we get into it Marie Kondo style, we must halt, pause and take a deep think about what we are getting ourselves into. While you may feel like a closet organizer mogul when you first see DIY organizing hacks on Pinterest, try to not bite off more than you can chew.</p>



<p><strong>Take it from Jamie and Fillip Hord, the professional organizers and founders of <a href="https://horderly.com/about/#:~:text=Horderly%20founders%20Jamie%20and%20Fillip,to%20people%20around%20the%20country." target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horderly.</a> Start with a small section of your closet when going through a wardrobe closet organizer revamp</strong>. That way, it&#8217;s easier to keep the madness under control.</p>



<p>Fine, one step at a time. Are we ready for those DIY organizing hacks yet? WAIT!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don’t. Forget. To. Declutter.</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Use this Discardian tip from Dinah Sanders to begin that deep decluttering process of your wardrobe closet:</strong> Turn around all the hangers in your closet, so their pointy ends face towards you (yes, the wrong side). Now, each time you wear a specific item of clothing, turn the hanger back around the correct way. At the end of six months, see how many clothes have been worn and donate away!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">C<strong>loset organizer DIY hacks to elevate your wardrobe closet aesthetic</strong></h2>



<p>No matter if you have a walk-in closet you have been secretly using for private bedroom pop concerts or a shoebox closet that is spilling out into your room monstrously. These DIY closet organizer hacks are here to save the day. Or shall we say, save the aesthetic?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DIY Hacks for your wardrobe closet #1: Exactly what meets the eye</strong></h3>



<p>This is perhaps the golden wardrobe closet organizer rule. When you own a lot of stuff, you use only what you see. If you’re running out (ok, maybe just to your laptop) for that meeting, you always wear the first thing you see. So how about you put things you use most at eye level?</p>



<p>The efficiency. The finesse.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organizing DIY hacks #2: Wire baskets/ clear shelves</h3>



<p>Wire baskets offer the perfect crossover between aesthetic and closet organizer visibility. Don’t be afraid to use as many as you want and of different sizes.</p>



<p>You’ll know exactly what’s inside. Plus, they offer a rustic/ Pinterest feel no matter where placed.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4 Pegboard mounted inside closet door</h3>



<p>Okay so while we are on the wardrobe closet/ dressing room trail, let us talk about adding a pegboard to increase the organization level of smaller items.</p>



<p>You can place little items like sunglasses, mini umbrellas, or make-up items— even customize them with photos to add a personalized touch.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#6 Garment rack (on wheels, preferably!)</h3>



<p>Undoubtedly a growing trend within wardrobe closet styles. This would entail an open garment rack that you can choose decorate however you want, and curate and put up your trendiest clothes on display in any corner of the room. Oh of course- it adds ease of access + visibility.</p>

<p>We know, we know, &#8220;organize your closet!&#8221; sounds like something your mom used to say to you as a kid and it probably annoyed you back then. But as you grow older, something changes. Just the sight of a well-put-together closet (that you’ve spent hours cleaning out), you desperately want to expand your space, and DIY hacks give you life.</p>



<p>Now, if you’re like us, you’ve probably spent approximately a hundred hours watching DIY hacks videos on Youtube (Or TikTok if you’re hip and cool). Marie Kondo is probably your role model at this point. And as satisfying as it is to watch these videos, you also know that some of the things you need to really fix your closet are out of your budget right now.</p>



<p>Well, this is where we come in. What if we told you, you can organize your closet (which is kinda like organizing your life) on a budget? And I don’t mean just fold-your-clothes-better type hacks, I’m talking professional-level organizing here. ON A BUDGET! With DIY HACK! YES, it is possible and we’re going to show you exactly how.</p>



<p>Use these amazing tips and DIY hacks to organize your closet and believe me, even Marie Kondo herself would be proud of you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Organize your Closet- Step 1: &#8220;<strong>Keep or Toss&#8221;</strong></h2>



<p>In order to expand your space and organize your closet, there are a few things to keep in mind which will make the whole organizing process a lot easier for you. To begin, you will have to play a little game of Keep or Toss. And this step will cause no burden on your budget, so there&#8217;s that.</p>



<p>If you’re a hoarder, this step will be really difficult for you; letting go of things, and the memories attached to them, can be really hard. But believe me, if you want to expand your space, this step is a must. <a href="https://projecthotmess.com/things-from-your-wardrobe-you-need-to-throw-out-today/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here is a really helpful guide</a> to make this process easier! One way to do this is by dividing your clothes up into different sections- your day-to-day clothes, your office clothes, your party clothes, and so on. Once they&#8217;re in different sections, the process of throwing clothes away (or donating them) will feel less overwhelming. Now that you have narrowed down your stuff, you can start to organize your closet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: a<strong>nalyze your space</strong></h2>



<p>Just like every person is unique, their storage space is unique as well. In this case, one shoe does not fit all (or however that saying goes). So once your space is completely empty, take a good hard look at it. How would you organize your closet? If you don’t have a hanging rod, now would be a very good time to invest in one. Do you think adding some shelves would make life easier? Or maybe the whole thing could use a cool new paint job. Whatever it is that you think would spruce up the space, you should look into it. This is a <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/organizing/g2171/diy-closet-organizers/?slide=3" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">great place to look at DIY hacks</a>.</p>



<p>Adding some cute lights and paint can really brighten up your room without much effort at all. Here is where you can figure out what kind of storage solution you need &#8211; whether it’s baskets, a chest of drawers, hooks, or hangers. So, go ahead and figure out what the space needs, but keep your budget in mind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: <strong>DIY hacks</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, all the arts-and-crafts geeks, this is your time to shine. To organize your closet on a budget means you need to use a lot of DIY hacks. This is a great time to reuse old boxes as storage solutions. Old shoeboxes, cartons, boxes you got from Amazon deliveries, just need a bit of makeover, and just like that, you’ve got yourself a fancy storage box. You can use cute wrapping paper to match them to your decor theme. Just be sure to label the boxes at the end, so you know which box contains what.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 4: expand your <strong>hanging space</strong></h2>



<p>Most of us are so preoccupied with making space in our shelves and drawers, that we forget that there is a perfect space that is being completely ignored &#8211; the space <em>above</em> your shelves. Expand your space by hanging your clothes. It also makes finding your clothes a million times easier.</p>



<p>You don’t have to keep digging around to find that one dress you bought last summer &#8211; it&#8217;s right in front of you! If you don’t already have one, get a hanging rod installed ASAP. And while you’re at it, buy a few hooks for the back of your door as well. It is a fantastic place to hang your scarves, belts, headbands, or hats. This is one of the greatest DIY hacks of all time!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 5: <strong>Expand your space</strong></h2>



<p>Haven’t you ever looked at your closet after a shopping spree and thought to yourself, “damn, I wish I had a little bit more space for my stuff.” Well, maybe that’s something that <em>is</em> possible. You can actually expand your space in your closet by raising your existing shelves or hanging rod by a few inches. This is a really simple yet effective way to open up your space and organize your closet. DIY hacks ftw!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 6: d<strong>on’t forget about the floor!</strong></h2>
