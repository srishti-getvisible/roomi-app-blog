<p>The main university in Provo is the&nbsp;<strong>Brigham Young University</strong>, which is a religious school affiliated with the LDS Church. It&#8217;s located in the middle of looming overhead mountains grandly displaying the seasons, and nearby Sundance serving as the perfect vista for winter or summer past-times. South of campus is full of BYU-approved housing, including apartment complexes and multiple-room houses; large apartment complexes and resulting communities abound all around the edge of campus as well. A stroll down University Ave toward Center Street acquaints you with many of the small businesses and locals. After freshman year, most students live off-campus, with many commuting mostly by bike or by foot.</p>



<p>The dorms mostly consist of freshmen, and many of these freshmen form strong groups, usually within their churchward, that last throughout college. Every dorm building has its own culture, with some offering more socialization than others (for example, those that include six students per unit and have individual kitchens usually have fewer social functions; those that include 1-2 students per unit, without individual units, usually have more). There aren’t any sororities or fraternities on campus, but church wards often provide a lot of social structure. There are also a lot of campus functions and activities, often specifically geared toward freshmen, but these are also often attended by ward groups.</p>



<p>Besides BYU, here are the other universities and colleges in Provo, Utah.</p>

Buses run primarily in dedicated lanes every 6 minutes at peak times and every 10-15 minutes in the off-peak hours. Additionally, BYU and UVU have partnered with UTA to provide free access to all UTA services (including the Frontrunner train) for students, faculty, staff, and family members. Also,&nbsp;the RYDE shuttle route&nbsp;runs to and from the BYU campus and certain Provo apartment complexes. </p>

<p>Every July, Provo hosts&nbsp;America&#8217;s Freedom Festival at Provo&nbsp;which includes the&nbsp;Stadium of Fire&nbsp;at BYU. It is held in&nbsp;LaVell Edwards Stadium, home to BYU&#8217;s&nbsp;NCAA&nbsp;football&nbsp;team. The Independence Day festivities are popular among residents and have featured such notable figures as&nbsp;Bob Hope,&nbsp;David Hasselhoff,&nbsp;Reba McEntire,&nbsp;Mandy Moore, and Toby Keith.&nbsp;In 2015, the event included performances by&nbsp;Journey&nbsp;and&nbsp;Olivia Holt and was hosted by television personality&nbsp;Montel Williams.</p>



<p>Provo also has two other large festivals each fall.&nbsp;Festival Latinoamericano&nbsp;is an annual family-oriented Labor Day weekend event in downtown Provo that offers the community a taste of the region&#8217;s&nbsp;Hispanic&nbsp;culture through ethnic food, vendors, and performances.</p>



<p>Additionally, the city has hosted an annual LGBT Provo Pride Festival since 2013.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.provopride.org/">More informatio</a><a href="https://www.provopride.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">n on the same can be found here!</a></p>
