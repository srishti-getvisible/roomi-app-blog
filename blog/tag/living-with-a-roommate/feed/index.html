<p>When it comes to living with an international roommate, the experience is like a coin with two sides—each with its own set of perks and challenges.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s chat about what makes this journey so special, and what bumps you might find along the way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pros</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cultural enrichment:</strong> Imagine celebrating Diwali, Christmas, and Chinese New Year all in one apartment! Living with someone from a different culture turns your home into a mini global village. You get a firsthand look at traditions, foods, and daily practices that books or documentaries can barely do justice to.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Language practice:</strong> Ever wanted to learn Spanish, French, or Mandarin but found classes too dull or expensive? Well, if your roommate speaks a different language, it’s a great opportunity to practice or learn a new language. It&#8217;s much more engaging and fun to learn by conversing daily than through books or apps alone</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Expanding your perspectives:</strong> Discussing world events with someone from another country can open your eyes to different perspectives. It encourages open-mindedness and can challenge preconceived notions you might have about other cultures.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>New friends and connections:</strong>: Having a foreign roommate often means they might have friends from other countries too. This can expand your social circle and introduce you to a diverse group of people you might not have met otherwise. It can be particularly valuable if you’re looking into working or studying abroad.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cons</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Different daily routines:</strong> Your idea of early might be their idea of a sleep-in. Maybe your roommate comes from a culture where dinner at 10 PM is the norm, while you’re used to eating by 6 PM. These differences in daily routines can be quirky at first, but frustrating if not navigated carefully.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Communication hiccups:</strong> Even if you both speak the same language, certain nuances and expressions can lead to misunderstandings. Sometimes, what’s considered a harmless joke in one culture can be a rude remark in another. It’s all about navigating these nuances with care and a good dose of humor.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Privacy issues:</strong> In some cultures, it’s normal to enter someone’s room without knocking, while in others, such privacy invasions could lead to World War III in the apartment! Setting clear boundaries that respect both your privacy is key.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Household habits:</strong> Cultural differences can extend to everyday habits and lifestyles, from cleaning standards to cooking smells, noise levels, and even the way you spend your leisure time. What’s normal in one culture (like leaving dishes overnight) might be a no-go in another. This might require adjustments and compromises that not everyone is comfortable with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, here are some practical tips to help you navigate the rewarding yet complex dynamics of living with someone from a different cultural background.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Explore with your international roommate</h3>



<p>A new city or country often means new stores and chains you don’t recognize. For your international roommate, it could be quite a culture shock.</p>



<p>Take time to get to know the city together. Find a favorite grocery store, try a couple of happy hours, and just explore the neighborhood with your roommate even if you aren’t best friends (yet).</p>



<p>After you’re done raiding the local farmer’s market, schedule a night to&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/roommate-bonding-activities/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">try cooking a new dish</a>&nbsp;—maybe you’ll discover a new favorite you’ve never heard of before!</p>



<p>Trust us — while it seems like a small gesture, it will help your new roommate feel at home.</p>



<p>This goes both ways, though! They might have some killer recs for you too. Never tried Ethiopian food? Who better to show you exactly how to eat that spongy bread than a local?</p>



<p>And if you and your international roommate have any sort of language barrier, just remember: Food is the universal language.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Share cultural norms</h3>



<p>When it comes to sharing stuff, it’s always&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">best to ask</a>&nbsp;— whether it’s food or toiletries, don’t just assume it’s yours to use.</p>



<p>Hopefully, you’re doing that anyway, but sharing habits aren’t always so common sense. Americans, for example, might be more casual about “borrowing” something than someone from abroad.</p>



<p>Wherever you stand on the sharing thing, it’s best to talk about it early on to avoid any misunderstandings on either of your part. The last thing you want is to sour your relationship with your international roommate over some grapes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Be&nbsp;crystal clear about what’s ‘included’</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s super important to be transparent about what&#8217;s included in your living arrangement.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t just about the rent and bills—though those are key—it&#8217;s about all the little (and not so little) things that can cause misunderstandings if they&#8217;re not spelled out from the get-go.</p>



<p>For example, let&#8217;s talk about the basics like utilities. Are all utilities included in the rent, or will you and your roommate be splitting the costs of things like electricity, water, and internet? This should be laid out clearly to avoid any surprises when the bills start rolling in.</p>



<p>But beyond the financials, you should also discuss what living essentials are shared and what aren&#8217;t. Will you be sharing food, or is everyone on their own for meals?</p>



<p>What about cleaning supplies or bathroom essentials like toilet paper—will these be communal expenses, or is everyone expected to pitch in separately?</p>



<p>And here&#8217;s one that often gets overlooked: space usage. Be clear about which areas are communal and which are private. Can you both use the living room for hanging out or hosting friends? Who gets which shelves in the fridge?</p>



<p>These might seem like small details, but they can lead to big headaches if they&#8217;re not hashed out upfront.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Use a good app</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re moving to a new country and need some navigating the rental landscape, having the right tools can make all the difference.</p>



<p>This is where a reliable international roommate finder like <a href="https://roomiapp.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Roomi</a> steps in. Roomi isn’t just another platform to find a place to live; it connects you to a vibrant community of renters who are actively looking to share their living spaces.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don’t assume anything</h3>



<p>Assumptions can be the quickest route to misunderstandings. When you live with someone from a different cultural background, try to avoid jumping to conclusions based on your cultural norms.</p>



<p>For example, if your roommate doesn’t share much about their personal life, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re unfriendly. Some cultures value privacy and might take longer to open up.</p>



<p>Always ask and communicate instead of assuming; this will help you avoid many potential conflicts and help you understand your roommate’s actions and responses better.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Make intros</h3>



<p>Hopefully, you and your new international roommate can find some common ground to let a friendship bloom.</p>



<p>But even if you’re not the best of buds, you might be able to introduce them to their next BFF — making you Roommate of the Year!</p>



<p>So get on your Facebook/Instagram/X (or any other social media platform you use) and make some intros. It&#8217;ll be the easiest thing you can do with the largest payoff.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Avoid using stereotypes</h3>



<p>It’s also important for you to recognize and avoid relying on stereotypes when interacting with your international roommate.</p>



<p>It’s way better to get to know your roommate as a person. Ask them about their interests, their family, what a typical day looked like for them back home, or their favorite music.</p>



<p>You’ll likely find that they’re much more than any stereotype could cover. Plus, this kind of open curiosity may help you build a more genuine and respectful relationship.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve moved in with your new roommate, and things are mostly going great. But then, little things start popping up—maybe it&#8217;s dishes left in the sink longer than you&#8217;d like, or the bathroom becomes a free-for-all during your morning routine.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to think, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll just let it slide this time,&#8221; but those little annoyances can quickly snowball into major irritations if they aren&#8217;t addressed.</p>



<p>The trick here is to bring up issues while they&#8217;re still small. You might worry about coming off as naggy, but it&#8217;s really about keeping your shared space comfortable for everyone.</p>



<p>If you notice something, say something (in a polite way, of course.) Your roommate might not even realize they&#8217;re doing something that bugs you. People have different living habits, and what’s obvious to you might not be to someone else.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Be patient</h3>



<p>Living with a foreign roommate may test your patience in all sorts of ways. Think about it: each of us grows up with our own set of norms, and it can take a minute to adjust when someone else’s norms crash into ours.</p>



<p>However, showing a bit of patience can make things much easier. It allows everyone some breathing room to adjust and find common ground. Remember — just like you’re adapting to their quirks, they’re adjusting to yours.</p>



<p>Showing patience gives you time to understand and respect your roommate&#8217;s needs and preferences and vice versa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>And there you have it! Living with an international roommate goes beyond just sharing a space—it&#8217;s about sharing experiences, learning from each other, and growing together in unexpected ways.</p>



<p>With these tips in your back pocket, you&#8217;re all set to make the most of this unique living arrangement.</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>We, at Roomi, understand that living with one or more roommates is not always easy and it can often be a necessity when you can’t afford a house or apartment on your own.</p>



<p>Sharing a home with the right roommates can definitely be a lot of fun, but it&#8217;s also important to consider that roommate harassment issues are very real. While there are a host of roommate harassment laws that you could prepare yourself with, there are other know-hows that could help you.</p>



<p>You can avoid a lot of headaches by carefully selecting housemates.&nbsp;You can also prepare a written roommate agreement that covers the day-to-day details of living together.&nbsp;This may include how you will resolve any problems that come up, and knowing your legal rights as a roommate. Here’s what you need to know about resolving a situation with a hostile roommate. As well as all the legal rights you have living with roommates!</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sign-roommate-agreement/189/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Why Should I Sign a Roommate Agreement?</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-roommate-harassment-laws">What are Roommate Harassment Laws?</h2>



<p>Well, there can be a wide range of things that can be considered roommate harassment. Additionally, the issues are fairly minor and easily resolvable. But other times they aren&#8217;t. This might require you to know your legal rights as a roommate and intervention from law enforcement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-settling-minor-roommate-disputes">Settling minor roommate disputes</h3>



<p>Even with a clear written roommate agreement, disputes might arise. Communication is key to a quick resolution. Here are some points you can do:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Speak up if you’re upset by something your roommate (or a roommate’s guest or pet) did or didn’t do, said, or didn’t say. Calmly explaining why you’re upset might also help. Be specific and let your roommate know how to keep the peace in the future.</li>



<li>Including a section on dispute resolution in your roommate agreement, or perhaps an agreement to try mediation on specific issues might help.</li>
</ul>



<p>Technically, all roommates should sign the rental agreement or lease. A lease makes you co-tenants. Legally speaking, this means that each of you will be individually responsible for paying the entire rent each month. As well as fulfilling other rental obligations.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-i-do-if-roommate-harassment-is-getting-out-of-hand">What can I do if roommate harassment is getting out of hand?</h3>



<p>If your roommate is on the lease or other recognized elements of residency, such as utility bills in their name, or if they receive mail at this location, it gets far more complex.</p>



<p>For example, to evict a roommate who has established residency in New York, you must use the <a href="https://nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/holdover_roommate.shtml" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">court system</a> to evict your roommate, even if he or she isn&#8217;t listed on the lease as a tenant.</p>



<p>One good way to evict your roommate is to start writing a letter, asking your roommate to leave. As per most roommate harassment laws, putting your request in writing creates a paper trail for if and when you go to court.</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/can-i-evict-roommate-nyc-pandemic/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Can I Evict A Roommate During COVID In NYC?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-i-evict-my-roommate">Can I evict my Roommate?</h3>



<p>Roommate eviction depends on whether your roommate is on the lease or not. If they aren&#8217;t on the lease, they&#8217;re considered a &#8216;month-to-month&#8217; tenant, so you don&#8217;t have to go to court. You just have to give them at least 30 days to vacate.</p>



<p>However, if they&#8217;re on the lease, you have to file a roommate holdover proceeding. According to New York state law, you can file for your roommate to be evicted if you&#8217;re the master tenant. But if both of you are on the lease, it&#8217;s in the hands of your landlord.</p>

<p>To start a case, you have to file an eviction lawsuit with the New York City housing court to start an official eviction proceeding.&nbsp;Threatening your roommate will only hurt in this case as you&#8217;ll be the one in legal trouble as a result of that.&nbsp;The next step is to call the police and ask them to forcibly remove your roommate if they remain in your home more than 72 hours after receiving the eviction notice.</p>



<p>After all of that occurs and your day in court arrives, come prepared with all communication that has occurred between you and your roommate, as well as the lease which shows that you are the rightful owner of the property and that your roommate has no legal grounds on which to stay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this is a costly and messy process no one wants to go through, the only way to have complete rights to stay is if you&#8217;re the one whose name is on the lease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roommate Harassment Laws: What To Do About It</h2>



<p>If the roommate harassment in question constitutes violence, here’s what you can do.</p>



<p>Even if you aren&#8217;t romantically involved with your roommate, legal counsel or help from a women’s shelter can help you determine if your relationship falls under the category of domestic violence. To benefit from extended protection to victims of domestic violence, check with local law enforcement or a women’s shelter regarding state laws applicable to your situation. Some laws that may apply include the following:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Anti-discrimination status and eviction protection</h3>



<p>In many states, it&#8217;s illegal to discriminate against someone who&#8217;s a victim of domestic violence. So, a landlord can&#8217;t refuse to rent (or terminate) solely because the person is a victim of domestic violence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Early termination rights</h3>



<p>Usually, a victim of domestic violence can end a lease with notice (often 30 days). States typically require that the tenant provide proof (such as a protective order) of their status as a domestic violence victim.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Limits on rental clauses</h3>



<p>In some states, landlords can&#8217;t include clauses that provide for termination, should a tenant call the police in the face of domestic violence, nor can landlords make tenants pay for the cost of such calls.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Section 8 tenants</h3>



<p>Domestic violence victims may evade regular relocation requirements if they have otherwise complied with other&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/section-8/tenants.page#:~:text=The%20Housing%20Choice%20Voucher%20program,annual%20income%20and%20family%20size.)**" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Section 8 requirements</a>, have moved to protect someone who is or has been a domestic violence victim, and “reasonably believed” that they were imminently threatened by harm from further violence.</p>



<p><strong>What are Section 8 Tenants?</strong></p>



<p>The Housing Choice Voucher program, also known as Section 8, is a federally funded program that assists eligible low- and moderate-income families to rent housing in the private market. Eligibility for this program is based on a family’s gross annual income and family size.</p>

<p>If your roommate has threatened or engaged in real physical violence against you, you can get a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.womenslaw.org/laws/general/restraining-orders" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Domestic Violence Temporary Restraining Order</a>&nbsp;from the court that asks for a residence exclusion order. This order will require your roommate to leave the apartment immediately.</p>



<p>The trickiest part about dealing with a dangerous roommate is that things that you want to happen immediately take a long time. The safest option would be for you to stop staying at your shared place from the time that you deliver a letter of notice until your roommate moves out. Even if this much precaution seems impossible, try to line up at least two different places where you can stay if you feel uncomfortable at home.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your roommate doing alright?</h3>



<p>This past year or so has been extremely stressful and everyone&#8217;s mental health has taken a toll. It can be understandable if your roommate has been extremely cranky. Is your roommate doing okay? They may under immense pressure from their job or college or be overloaded with assignments. Your roommate maybe just going through a rough patch and keeping it all to themselves.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your roommate mentally unwell?</h3>



<p>Coming off the previous point, your roommate may be suffering from mental issues. You may not understand or know what is going in their personal lives. Thus, you only see them being difficult with you. While you are probably not a mental health expert, there may be signs. Are they having difficulties with people, their work, or their family? Do they seem to be troubled all the time and can&#8217;t seem to have fun once in a while?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is it your fault?</h3>

<p>No, we aren&#8217;t gaslighting you or putting the blame on you, friend. We&#8217;d never. Your controlling roommate should never behave with you like that anyway. However, a little self-reflection may be in order. Is there something that you have done to see this side of them? Is there a time that you may have been rude or unkind to justify this kind of treatment? Or are you skipping your chores or being exceptionally messy?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are they just jealous?</h3>



<p>Now, we understand that you&#8217;re quite a cool kid and your friends love you. While you may have previously expected that your roommate will too, it is possible they&#8217;re jealous. After all, not everyone can handle all the awesomeness hon.</p>



<p>There could be some reason why your controlling roommate is jealous of you. This may just be their way of expressing it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding a solution</h2>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve found the root of the problem, it&#8217;s time to resolve this, once and for all. You want to be careful and sensitive while dealing with your roommate. Make sure you don&#8217;t send them into a flying rage. However, if you read on, we&#8217;re pretty sure you won&#8217;t.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-do-i-resolve-a-conflict-with-my-college-roommate/">Related: </a><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-do-i-resolve-a-conflict-with-my-college-roommate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Do I Resolve A Conflict with my College Roommate?</a></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You have to deal with it</h3>



<p>Now, not all of us are great at confrontation. The introverts and socially awkward kids among us understand the pressure of something like this. However, you can&#8217;t always keep walking on eggshells around your own apartment. Think of all that you have been put with, and convince yourself that you need to have this conversation. The sooner you deal with this the better. Do not put it off for later and give a chance for more issues to come up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make changes yourself</h3>



<p>If there is any way that you may have triggered your controlling roommate, try to see if you can do something. Clean up your space, be considerate, do your chores and give them their space. If there is something that you are doing wrong, try to make amends and see if your controlling roommate reacts to this positively.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lend an ear to them</h3>



<p>It could be that issues at work, college, or their personal life are the cause of their behavior. Make yourself more approachable and let them know you are there to lend an ear to them. If not, approach them and ask them how they are doing. Perhaps even share a few problems that you are having and take initiative. If they warm up to you and share their problems, then you may be on the path to a resolution.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Be sensitive and mindful</h3>



<p>When you sit down to have a conversation with your controlling roommate, be mindful of how you approach them. The last thing you want to do is come off as aggressive or antagonize your controlling roommate. Make sure you approach them in a friendly way. If you have common friends, you may want to discuss this with them and even have them there. Be sensitive and willing to hear if they have any issues.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exercise caution</h3>



<p>The last thing you want to do is trigger your controlling roommate. They could have a tendency to go off the hook. If you feel that things could head wildly South, then make sure you have a friend around. If things escalate, be ready to call building security, the management, or even the police. After all, you never know with people. The last thing you want is to get hurt or into a physical conflict.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Set rules</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s never too late to set rules. If you feel that setting rules and boundaries will help, sit your roommate down. You can make a set of rules and responsibilities to share. This may help with your situation and ease the tension. Be open to their suggestions as well, and try to make something that works for everyone. Remember your rights as a roommate too. You don&#8217;t need to cave into ridiculous suggestions from your controlling roommates.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Time for &#8216;the talk&#8217;</h3>



<p>No, not that one. Once you&#8217;ve gone over the situation and made your assessment, it is time for you to sit them down. Let them know honestly but in a sensitive and friendly way. Put your foot down and don&#8217;t budge if they are being unreasonable. However, be ready to back off if you feel the situation could escalate. This is the make or break part. All the best!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If all fails</h2>



<p>Maybe it just isn&#8217;t meant to be with your controlling roommate. Never mind. There are many fish (potential roommates) in the sea (city.) If they don&#8217;t value you, it could be time to search for a new roommate. Lucky for you, you&#8217;re already in the right place!</p>

<p>Living with a roommate isn&#8217;t always sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes it&#8217;s not possible to get along with everyone &#8211; especially when it comes to dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. When a roommate doesn&#8217;t pay their dues or leaves coffee mugs in the living room <em>every single day</em>, it may be time to evict your roommate. Basically, the bottom line is that you deserve to feel comfortable and at peace in your own home.</p>



<p>Evicting a roommate can be a touchy subject, especially if you&#8217;re someone who would rather avoid confrontation. But there&#8217;s nothing to worry about &#8211; we&#8217;re here to help you navigate through this ordeal so you know what you should and shouldn&#8217;t do when it comes to evicting your roommate.</p>



<p>Before making any rash decisions, we recommend you familiarize yourself with your state&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rentecdirect.com/blog/10-landlord-tenant-laws-to-remember/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenant’s rights</a>. Many states dictate that even if your roommate does not have their name on the lease, they&#8217;re eligible to stay. If you’re both co-tenants, your roommates’ violations of your apartment lease might also put you at risk of being evicted. Once you gain clarity on your rights as a renter, you can make more empowered decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. When should you evict your roommate?</h2>



<p>Evicting someone from their home was never going to be easy. But no one wants to put up with a roommate who’s become a problem either. Knowing when to evict your roommate depends on how uncomfortable you and others in the house are. If your roommate is stealing from you, compromising your security, or bringing in people that have long <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/dealing-with-a-friend-who-overstayed-welcome-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overstayed their welcome</a>, then it’s time to make a quick decision and just evict your roommate.</p>



<p>Maybe the reason for your anger with your roommate is something that they can change or work on. Try having a genuine conversation about the issue you&#8217;re facing.  In case this does not bring in results, take it as a sign and move forward with your eviction plan.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Gather evidence to evict your roommate properly</h2>



<p>Gathering evidence to evict your roommate does sound very Sherlock Holmes. But trust us, you&#8217;re going to need it to build your case. Evidence is simply proof that will make your case stronger, especially if they are doing something illegal or dangerous. So, gather any evidence that backs up your claim eg. take pictures of damage caused in the apartment or the pets that are not allowed in your rental home. Save the rent receipts if your roommate has failed to pay rent or share utilities. Be careful not to violate the privacy of your roommate while gathering evidence.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Prepare for that conversation</h2>



<p>Is it normal to dread this conversation with your roommate? Yes. This conversation is something you probably need to think about and prepare for in advance. It&#8217;s best to go into it with a calm mind. Knowing how to evict your roommate will be a learning experience and hopefully it&#8217;ll deliver the outcome you need.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Finally, tell them they need to move out</h2>



<p>As you prepare yourself to have this conversation, it&#8217;s important to know that the way you present your case will determine how your roommate feels about the entire situation. For example, you don’t have to tell your roommate you don’t want to live with them. Instead, you could say that you want to try living alone or someone else who is close to you is moving in with you.</p>



<p>Basically, you don&#8217;t have to disclose the specifics of why you want them to move out; you can be as diplomatic as possible. Try to keep blame and pent-up anger far away, and you should be mild in your approach and tell them that maybe this is not a good fit, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re not a good person.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">To sum it up&#8230;</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Before you evict your roommate, give them at least two to three months of advance notice, asking them to leave at the end of the lease if possible.</li><li>Understand that moving out in a pandemic can be tricky. You can offer your help in finding a new place.</li><li>Have concrete information ready, like the exact date you want them out, but be prepared to answer all their questions respectfully.</li></ul>
