<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know East Bronx</h2>



<p>The East Bronx is the eastern half of the Bronx borough in New York City, located east of the Bronx River. It is mainly residential and currently has more than 2.5 million people living in it. Of late, the distinctions between the East and West Bronx are mostly ignored. Prior to the 1970s, New Yorkers thought of the Bronx as being divided into two halves, one eastern and one western.</p>



<p>Summers in The Bronx are hot and humid. However, winters are very cold and windy. And the weather is rainy and partially overcast all year long. The temperature generally ranges from 27째F to 85째F throughout the year, with temperatures seldom falling below 13째F or rising over 93째F. So, look for rooms for rent in East Bronx with climate control to stay comfortable!</p>
