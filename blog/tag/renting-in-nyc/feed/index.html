<p>If you&#8217;ve found yourself here, you know NYC&#8217;s rental market is as competitive as a rental market can get. And in most competitive rental markets, tenants usually end up dealing with middlemen known as brokers. Apartments in New York have known the broker&#8217;s fee for a long time. The pandemic caused shifts in the rental market of 2020. And the consequences were felt by anyone dealing with renting in NYC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the standard broker&#8217;s fee in NYC?</h2>



<p>Brokers in NYC have near-absolute control over apartment listings, viewing appointments, and leases. In return for their services, <strong>broker&#8217;s fees in NYC can be as much as 15% on the annual lease.</strong> This is typically paid in one lump sum by tenants before they can move in.</p>



<p>With the pandemic changing things, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/big-drop-in-manhattan-rental-prices-lures-back-younger-residents.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC reported that the prices to rent and buy property in NYC dropped</a> so much that younger renters were found returning to the area.</p>



<p>However, low rent prices quickly turned into high broker fees. It&#8217;s also important to note that NYC is one of the few cities in the country with a broker industry. And it&#8217;s one of the few cities that has financial leverage over how people rent apartments.</p>



<p>Brokers used the new surge in renters to their advantage and started charging high fees. Earlier this year, charging a broker&#8217;s fee was banned in the city, but it was a temporary ban.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is the broker&#8217;s fee in NYC legal?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1602325978229-fc2d478ffba7?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="rent in NYC is a highly competitive, especially close to areas like radio city where the broker's fee in NYC itself is 15% of the annual rent"/></figure>



<p>In early February of 2020, the New York State effectively eliminated broker&#8217;s fees. NYC state regulators said renters can no longer be charged broker fees. With the elimination of broker fees in NYC, the state of New York holds an extreme potential to become one of the most favorable rent locations in all of the US.</p>



<p>This new rule, buried in legal guidance on last year’s rent laws, caught lawmakers, many landlords, and brokers off guard. But it&#8217;s safe to say that the tenant advocates cheered the new broker fee rule. Mostly because it helps tilt an uneven real estate playing field.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why was the broker fee in NYC eliminated?</h2>



<p>This new law was primarily aimed at protecting tenants and strengthening rent regulations. It mentions that tenants can be charged no more than $20 in fees when applying for an apartment, including background and credit checks. Previous rent laws have also capped security deposits at one month’s rent, further diminishing the lump sum amount renters typically must pay before being given keys to an apartment.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that the burden for broker fees in NYC falls directly on the landlords. Or they can choose to list, market, and lease their units on their own. <strong>The changes could effectively turn New York’s rental market into a no-fee market.</strong> <strong>That is if renters choose to hunt for an apartment without hiring a broker.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where does the banning of broker&#8217;s fees in NYC stand today?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1602325978196-37650f5d3203?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="man in black jacket and black pants riding on black motorcycle on road during daytime on his way to pay broker's fee in NYC"/></figure>



<p>Much to our dismay, banning broker fees in NYC has proved to be a slow process, and experts believe it&#8217;s going to take much longer.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a temporary restraining order that blocks the new guidance on renting in NYC from taking effect, so if you’re in the process of renting an apartment, you’ll still have to pay the broker’s fee. A tenant would also have to pay the fee if they, rather than the landlord, hired a broker to help them find an apartment.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Now that there’s a legal challenge to the ruling—do I have to pay the broker&#8217;s fee or not?</h3>



<p>While the court process grinds along, the real estate market has changed significantly. And with rents dropping and working tenants harder to come by, broker fees — are at least for now — becoming scarce in areas like Manhattan. However, in other parts of the city, like Astoria, Queens, most of the listings are still asking for a fee.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooklyn is an experience in itself. It&#8217;s colorful, wild, and comes with an uncanny sense of <em>home</em>. But if you&#8217;re trying to find apartments in Brooklyn, you will be faced with your own share of challenges. It’s either the expensive broker&#8217;s fees or apartments that don&#8217;t fit your budget. </span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522083165195-3424ed129620?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="Brooklyn Bridge during golden hour"/></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, today we&#8217;re listing some easy ways to find your oasis in Brooklyn!</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Social Media</b></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/brooklynninenine-brooklyn-nine-99-heist-KxiRwO7tqXCTDVKobo"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/KxiRwO7tqXCTDVKobo/giphy.gif?resize=500%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nbc Brooklyn 99 GIF by Brooklyn Nine-Nine - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="500" height="281" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Word of mouth is still part and parcel of passing information to relevant parties even with the high-tech options available. You can secure the best deals from your friends or workmates on social media who have an ear on the ground. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact a Facebook friend or group member who does email marketing to send messages to all contacts in Brooklyn who can help you in securing a rental depending on your budget. Use your other social media handles (LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter) to reach those contacts with attractive offers. You are one click away from getting help up by a former college mate whose neighbor just moved out. Unless you ask, you will never know!</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>Roommates on Roomi</b> are the easiest way to find apartments in Brooklyn!</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best budget decision to make when moving to Brooklyn is finding roommates. You will get the most bang for your buck when it comes to amenities, size, and location if you are splitting the costs with others who also don’t want to forgo their entire income just to live alone. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roomi is a hub of roommates with space available. The website also has an app so you can respond quickly to people answering questions about the room you’re interested in. It’s convenient and with a large number of users, there are always tons of Brooklyn listings. This app is your most effective tool when looking for great apartments roommates included!</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>RentHop</b> &amp; finding apartments in Brooklyn!</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RentHop is a friendly website where landlords, real estate developers and apartment agents do direct and ethical dealings on vacant apartments. The site keeps up -to-date information and refine options according to your desired housing (size/budget/area).</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to post on the site, landlords have to go through a security procedure. This gives home hunters peace of mind.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>Hit the road</b>, especially when you&#8217;re aiming to find apartments in Brooklyn</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/brooklynninenine-season-6-nbc-brooklyn-nine-APbMklGCGIE1BKcz9F"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/APbMklGCGIE1BKcz9F/giphy.gif?resize=500%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="Andy Samberg Jake Peralta GIF by Brooklyn Nine-Nine - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="500" height="281" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After searching for available apartments around Brooklyn on the internet, it’s best you walk around the area. The walk will help you point out things that were not advertised on the internet. Look around for “Vacant apartment” signs and walk into those buildings to view the vacancies. You will be surprised at how easy it is to find a pad without the help of brokers who sometimes charge almost the price of the rent for their services.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding an apartment for rent in Brooklyn is no walk in the park but the above sources will get your desired pad sooner than you expected.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you can expect to pay as rent in NYC is greatly dependent on how much money you make and how much of a sucker you are. JK, income doesn’t matter that much, you’ll probably over spend any way. The general recommendation is that rent should be no more than </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.lendkey.com/resources/how-much-of-your-income-should-you-spend-on-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your income. Thus a monthly income of $5,000 should strive to pay no more than $1,500 (5,000 x .3)/month. NYC is very much about give and take. And since the city has a lot to offer, it has no qualms with taking. Keep in mind, while you do want to live comfortably in the city, committing to apartments in New York over your budget is a guaranteed way to get into debt. Here is how much rent you can expect to spend from each </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.nycgo.com/boroughs-neighborhoods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC borough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bronx</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Yankees, Botanical Gardens, and the Bronx Zoo are some undeniable built-in amenities the Bronx offers along with art deco to marvel. Between Morris heights and University Heights the average rent in NYC is $1350/month. If Bronx is of interest to you get in quick, </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.metro.us/new-york/bronx-rent-increases-are-outpacing-manhattan-brooklyn/zsJpha---F8OS9GTha9YN6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the rates are increasing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">faster than others. </span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/s/Bronx+NY+USA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HERE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are spaces that are lower than the average. </span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Queens</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A personal fav- <a href="https://bit.ly/2QmdcDO" class="broken_link">Queens</a> is the epicenter of international cuisine. From authentic Greek in Astoria to Flushing’s Chinese fair, this borough is for New York&#8217;s foodies. This and a few other reasons may be why it is a little costlier to rent in NYC Queens than Brooklyn. With a recent 5% increase, median rental price in Queens is $2,550 ( for a studio). With all the outings to be enjoyed, this is a great place to shack up with roommates. That way you have more money in your pocket for ALL the gyros. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes no more than a single visit to be convinced to live in Brooklyn. My first walk along Brooklyn Heights Promenade is all it took me. To be near the live street music and dining scene and average rent in NYC will be $2,400/month for your own pad in Brooklyn. Or do what I did and have house mates, cutting this cost into thirds. Having roommates afforded me to live in the city of my dreams without drowning in the cost.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Manhattan</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason people romanticize Manhattan and it has nothing to do with Sex and the City. Manhattan is home to Time Square, Broadway, and pretty much everything food and entertainment, and of course great apartments in New York. Among the concrete jungle there are even hidden green spaces. In this famously expensive borough average rent in NYC for a 1 bedroom is </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/manhattan-studio-rent-breaks-records-2015-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3,400/month and counting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://bit.ly/2QmdcDO" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Staten Island</a></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forgotten borough&#8230;coming in at an impressive rent average rent in NYC of $1300/month for a 1 bedroom. New Yorkers should be ashamed of ignoring the island. Yes, it is a pain in the ass to take the ferry to get to the city, but there are so many other goodies that make up for the trek. Did I mention rent is actually affordable? Beyond this, Staten Island is much less crowded. </span>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">nd </span>it&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">perfect if you’re a nature lover. The most affordable borough may cost you travel time, but you won’t hear your bank account complaining. </span>Moreover, o<span style="font-weight: 400;">ne lesson NYC taught me was to work harder and spend smarter. Be reasonable with your expectations and budget when window shopping apartments in New York City. Regardless of the four walls you choose to sleep in, you’re still in the big city.</span></p>
