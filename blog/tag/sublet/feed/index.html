										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The biggest cause of stress for most of us in New York isn’t the traffic or the neighbors, it&#8217;s rent. The <a href="https://www.rentdata.org/new-york-ny-hud-metro-fmr-area/2024" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Fair Market Rent</a> in NYC for a two-bedroom apartment costs $2,752 monthly, 99% more expensive than in other cities.</p>



<p>And if you ever wanted to take a trip then that NYC apartment can start to feel like a ball and chain. What do you do then? It’s simple, sublet.&nbsp;That’s how you can enjoy your freedom and take time off to see the rest of the world. Here’s everything you need to know on how to sublet in NYC.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at&nbsp;what a sublet is, what it isn’t, and how you can do it&nbsp;in The Big Apple.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-sublet">What is a &#8216;Sublet&#8217;?</h2>



<p>A sublet is like a temporary leave of absence. Say you’re going to Europe for a month or two, but surely, you&#8217;re coming back. With so many people looking for a place to stay in New York City, it wouldn’t make a lot of sense to let the apartment sit there all alone without someone to keep it company. And pay your lease while you’re away. That’s why you should sublet an apartment in NYC. Lots of people need a temporary place because they just got to the city and need time to find something more permanent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-sublet-in-nyc-is-not-forever">A Sublet In NYC Is Not Forever</h3>



<p>That’s the difference between a sublet and assigning a lease. If you intend to come back, you need a sublet. If you&#8217;re trying to get out of your lease and you want someone to take it over completely, then you’re assigning it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-find-a-sublet-in-nyc">How to Find a Sublet in NYC</h2>



<p>Okay. The City of Dreams sleeps on a big fluffy bed made out of paperwork, so make sure to check off all the little details. Here’s the basic overview of what to do subletting in NYC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-gather-all-information-needed">#1: Gather all information needed</h3>



<p>It’s gonna feel like a lot, but none of it should be too hard to get.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The sublease length of the apartment in NYC. How long are you going to be out of town?</li>



<li>The name and address of the tenant from whom you’re subletting in NYC. Hopefully, you found them on Roomi because then you can use the chat feature to get all that from them if you don’t have it already.</li>



<li>Why are you subletting? Basically, the reason for your decision to sublet an apartment in NYC. Traveling musician? Visit family? Hula dancing?</li>



<li>Written consent of anyone else who has the primary lease with you, such as a guarantor or cosigner. Your roommate would be in for a surprise if they see another person they don&#8217;t know in the apartment without any kind of warning.</li>



<li>Finally, a copy of your own lease, if you can.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-find-a-subletter">#2: Find a Subletter</h3>



<p>A subletter couldn&#8217;t just be anyone. Ideally, someone you already know and trust is already a good candidate. Asking friends and family if they know anyone looking for a place is also a good way to find a dependable subletter. But the best way is to use a reliable room and roommate finder app, like Roomi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="612" height="408" data-attachment-id="21183" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-sublet-in-nyc/attachment/find-a-subletter/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?fit=612%2C408&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="612,408" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Find a Subletter" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?fit=612%2C408&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?resize=612%2C408&#038;ssl=1" alt="Find a Subletter" class="wp-image-21183" style="width:853px;height:auto" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?w=612&amp;ssl=1 612w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></figure>

<p>With Roomi, you can list your room and have potential subletters right away. The app is safe with security and privacy measures like in-app messaging, thorough background checks, and ID verification. This ensures that you&#8217;re talking to a real person behind the account and not a scammer or fraudster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3: Be wary of rental scams!</h3>



<p>Scammers are everywhere but don&#8217;t let them come near your subletting process. Take note of these rental scams and don&#8217;t fall for any misleading links or ghost apartments.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fake rentals or listings: </strong>These are bogus property listings with attractive photos to lure renters and eventually scam them into making deposits, then disappearing right after.</li>



<li><strong>Overseas landlords: </strong>Some landlords say they&#8217;re in a different country so they can&#8217;t meet you in person. They&#8217;ll make you send an advanced payment to secure the apartment or for them to mail the keys to you, but once the money&#8217;s sent, they&#8217;re gone.</li>



<li><strong>Phishing scams: </strong>These are deceptive emails or messages asking people to click on malicious links or provide sensitive information to eventually scam the person.</li>



<li><strong>Identity theft: </strong>Just like phishing scams, identity theft is prevalent online. Scammers use a different person&#8217;s identity to pose as a landlord, providing valid IDs to earn the trust of renters, then once the payment&#8217;s been sent over and it&#8217;s time to get the keys, the property is already occupied or it doesn&#8217;t exist.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4: Check with your landlord</h3>



<p>Next, it’s your landlord’s part that moves the subletting process further. They might have more questions or need additional info. If they do, get it to them as soon as you can. Remember, you have to send a written request with all that jazz to your landlord. Use certified mail, and make sure to ask for a return receipt. Once you send off any extra stuff, the 30-day countdown begins.</p>

<p>Your landlord’s got 30 days to say yes or no. If they don’t get back to you at all, then that counts as a yes. Now, you can have a great sublet experience in NYC!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5: Make a backup plan, just in case!</h3>



<p>Although settling your subletting situation takes a lot of work, it&#8217;s best to have a backup plan just in case. Set aside some extra money if your subletter doesn&#8217;t push through or there&#8217;s any mishap that happens, at least you&#8217;re prepared!</p>



<p>You can also have someone check in with you in case your subletter stops communicating with you, or they can&#8217;t pay a month&#8217;s rent for any reason. Remember, subletting is different than becoming a part of or signing a lease.</p>



<p>Now, it’s New York, so it shouldn’t come as a big shock to find out there are exceptions and special circumstances. Check out the “Tenant’s Rights” document, courtesy of the Attorney General, for more information that’ll make a sublet in NYC way easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time To Sublet!</h2>



<p>In the exciting world of subletting in NYC, the possibilities are endless! With the right information and resources, you can navigate the sublet market with confidence. Just remember to plan everything down to a T, beware of rental scams, have a backup plan, use a reliable room finder, and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>

<p>Thinking of going on a short vacation, but don&#8217;t want to keep paying rent while you&#8217;re not staying in the apartment? Subletting is the solution for you. To sublet means to rent out a room that&#8217;s already being rented for a short period of time. It&#8217;s a great idea to ensure your rent is paid and your room is still intact when you return. However, it&#8217;s important to do your research about NYC subletting laws before starting anything.</p>



<p>Remember that there are terms and conditions, and the rights to sublet involved in the process before you make money subletting. It isn’t as simple as saying ‘I want to sublet my room’ to a friend who pays your rent for you.</p>



<p>In fact, in some states, you can go to prison if you’re found subletting your room without getting your landlord’s approval! Make sure you’re following the rules and know all about the laws for subletting in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-things-to-know-before-subletting">5 Things to Know Before Subletting</h2>



<p>New Yorkers, if you’re thinking of subletting your room, you have more flexibility than other renters across America! It’s the only other jurisdiction (alongside <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/lifestyle/things-to-know-when-moving-to-chicago-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Chicago</a>) where subletting your room is allowed. That too, even if your landlord denies or ignores your request. But there are laws in place and some restrictions in subletting. Here are five things you need to know about NYC subletting laws:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-confirm-if-you-re-able-to-sublet-in-your-apartment">#1: Confirm if you&#8217;re able to sublet in your apartment</h3>



<p>Although subletting is legal in New York, there are restrictions in place for certain types of apartments. If you fall under&nbsp;any of the following categories, you&nbsp;may not&nbsp;have the right to sublet your room. So make sure you get permission from the relevant body in writing before starting to make money subletting:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Public housing residents or those who receive rent subsidies don&#8217;t have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Tenants that live in non-profit buildings don&#8217;t have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Tenants in co-op and condo apartments should consult their proprietary lease. Also check the building’s by-laws, as they may not have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Rent-stabilized tenants can sublet with a few restrictions: 1.) You have to maintain the apartment as your primary residence; 2.) You can&#8217;t charge more than the asking rent; 3.) You can&#8217;t sublet for more than 2 years.</li>



<li>Rent-controlled tenants don&#8217;t have the right to sublet by law and should check the clauses of their lease.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-let-your-landlord-know-through-writing">#2: Let your landlord know through writing</h3>



<p>The first step to subletting your apartment is to let your landlord know your plans to sublet 30 days before. You have to submit the following information by certified mail, return receipt requested:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The term and reason for subletting</li>



<li>The name of the person you’re subletting your room to</li>



<li>The business and permanent home address of the person subletting</li>



<li>Your address for the term of the sublet</li>



<li>Written consent from co-tenants or guarantor on the lease</li>



<li>A copy of the proposed sublease acknowledged by the main tenant and subtenant</li>
</ul>

<p>Your landlord has 10 days to ask for additional information, as long as it&#8217;s within reason. Then, if they fail to notify you whether they approve or reject your request within 30 days of your submission, it&#8217;s considered consent to sublet. However,&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">your landlord</a>&nbsp;can withhold the request if they have a good reason. As a result, you won’t be permitted to sublet your room by law. In circumstances where the landlord unreasonably withholds consent, you can go ahead with subletting your room anyway.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3: Subletting means you have to return to your apartment</h3>



<p>For subletting your room legally, you must plan on returning to the property once the term for subletting your room is up. If you think you’ll be gone for longer, speak to your landlord about breaking or re-assigning your lease to determine what the process should be.</p>



<p>As mentioned, you must have plans to return to the property after the term of subletting your room is over. But what happens when everything is going swimmingly? And you don’t want to go back to the room, and the new tenant has settled in? Can they take over your lease as per the right to sublet? Yes, they can.</p>



<p>Under NYC subletting laws, you must obtain written consent from the owner before proceeding. The owner is under no obligation to give their consent, nor do they have to provide a reason for denying the lease takeover.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4: Be aware of legal issues surrounding subletting</h3>



<p>If your landlord declines your request, and you still let another person sublet your room, there&#8217;s a high chance that you&#8217;ll be evicted for lease violations depending on your lease. With NYC subletting laws, certain legal issues could easily be avoided as long as you&#8217;re careful in planning and have everything in writing.</p>

<p>If your landlord rejects your request and you still proceed to sublet your room, you may face eviction. A case can be filed and if you lose, you can still keep the apartment by having the subtenant (the person subletting) move out within 10 days of the judgment. Either way, you&#8217;ll probably still pay your landlord&#8217;s attorney&#8217;s fees if your lease has an attorney&#8217;s fees clause. So, make sure to check and review your lease well.</p>



<p>One thing to consider is if you can actually make money while subletting, and the simple answer is yes, you can, with a few limitations. The right to sublet allows adding an extra 10% of the monthly rent onto the price when subletting your room. But only as long as the place is furnished. Your landlord also has the right to “sublet allowance,&#8221; another 10% of the monthly rent.</p>



<p>So as per NYC subletting laws, you can rent the room at 20% more than you pay. If you’re adding on more and the new tenant finds out, they can file a complaint and you’d have to pay a heavy fine.&nbsp;But if you&#8217;re in a rent-stabilized apartment, you can&#8217;t charge more than your current rent. <a href="https://hcr.ny.gov/office-rent-administration-ora#contact-ora" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)</a>&nbsp;is the state agency that governs this and contains up-to-date information regarding the latest updates to the right to sublet.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also the issue of illusory sublets where the main tenant hasn&#8217;t been in the apartment, meaning it isn&#8217;t their primary residence violating NYC subletting laws. A complaint can be filed by the cotentant which will require the owner to recognize the subtenant as the actual tenant who can renew their lease.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5: You can use an online tool to help sublet your room</h3>



<p>You can use an online room and roommate finder tool, like Roomi, to help streamline your subletting process. Roomi is a trusted online platform with listings and verified users around the globe.

<p>As it is, spare rooms are frequently left unused, or they become a dumping ground for stuff&nbsp;that has no other place to go. They are usually the smallest room in the house, so it&#8217;s a challenge to find its purpose. However, with a little planning and intelligent placing, you can create a home to be proud of. And no, we&#8217;re not talking about the regular spare room ideas with a guest room or home office. We believe a spare bedroom can be used for a variety of purposes, including practicing a hobby, creating a play area for your children, and even subletting it to create a new source of income.</p>



<p><strong><em>Here are 8 unique spare room ideas to make the most out of your space!</em></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-your-very-own-home-gym">3. Your very own home gym!</h2>



<p>Is your treadmill in the living room becoming a pile-up? To establish a dedicated workout space, move it to an empty room with your other exercise equipment. Position a full-length mirror against one of the walls to help you perfect your technique. You might discover that when your equipment is all ready to go, you&#8217;ll want to get moving more often.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-create-a-mini-library">4. Create a mini library</h2>



<p>Have you ever imagined yourself like Belle from &#8220;Beauty and the Beast,&#8221; whirling around in your own private library surrounded by towering bookshelves? If you don&#8217;t have enough space in your living room for a home library, your spare bedroom will suffice. Arrange shelves along the walls and set aside a place for the most comfortable chair you can find.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-garden-your-space">5. Garden your space</h2>



<p>Among excellent spare room ideas that help our environment is gardening! Gardeners without the space or cash for a greenhouse can grow seedlings in their spare bedroom from the end of winter to the beginning of spring. Purchase readymade shelves or build your own, and be sure to use lights that help plants to flourish.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-walk-in-closet">6. Walk-in closet!</h2>



<p>If your style is a priority, the extra room could double up as a classic dressing room. Consider this: a vanity, shoe and accessory organizers, and a myriad of mirrors. A vintage screen and elaborate lighting finish off this interior to perfection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-play-game-room">7. Play/game room</h2>



<p>If you have children, you might want to consider turning the extra room into a playroom. Arrange their toys to create a large space for them to play and be active.</p>



<p>Consider investing in a wide area rug to make sitting on the floor more comfortable. Make sure there are enough arts and crafts in the room in case of a stormy day. The best part of all? You won&#8217;t find as many toys thrown around your living room, bathroom and garden!</p>



<p>Game rooms are also among the most fantasized spare room ideas for bachelors! You can design a dedicated game room with comfortable chairs and a wide table that can hold huge boards. Set up a console zone with beanbag seats if you&#8217;re a big player. Add a mini-fridge packed with game-night beverages for a luxurious touch, and you&#8217;re good to go!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-brainstorm-area">8. Brainstorm area</h2>



<p>Having a proper space&nbsp;to work out your ideas, whether you&#8217;re a writer or an entrepreneur, is vital. Convert your spare room into an area&nbsp;with whiteboards and plenty of blank wall space where you can plan out your ideas and let your imagination run wild. It doesn&#8217;t have to be an office, but rather a place where you can be yourself!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Got some questions about subletting? Subletting is a term that describes an individual allowing someone to rent all or part of a currently leased house or apartment. You can sublet your apartment if you&#8217;re going away for an extended period, or if you want to completely move out before the lease is up, for example. Subletting in Los Angeles, California is not a smooth ride, and you could come into tons of issues if you don&#8217;t comply with the subletting laws. If you want to find out how to sublet in Los Angeles, then cozy up with this Roomi blog and we&#8217;ll explain all!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-carefully-read-through-your-lease">1. Carefully read through your lease</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/NFA61GS9qKZ68" title="read"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>This first step is very important because your entire plan of action depends on it. Before you go ahead and sublet your apartment, you have to be certain that your lease permits you to. According to <a href="https://legalbeagle.com/13724419-california-sublet-laws-rules-for-tenants-subtenants.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">California law</a>, you must obtain written consent from your landlord before subletting, and if your lease says you can&#8217;t sublet, then sorry &#8211; but you really can&#8217;t. You can figure out whether you&#8217;re allowed to sublet in your lease under a clause entitled, &#8216;assignments and sublets&#8217;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-get-approval-from-your-landlord">2. Get approval from your landlord</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re reading this step, then congratulations! You&#8217;re allowed to sublet, even if it does come with a price. You&#8217;ll need to get written approval from your landlord which gives you consent. But even before this, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that you find a subtenant who meets the requirements of the landlord, as you prepare to sublet.</p>

<p>Found a potential subletter? Awesome! That means you&#8217;re well on your way to successfully subletting an apartment in Los Angeles. You must find an individual who is as financially stable as you are. Make sure you specify the important subtenant qualifications when marketing your listings. This will help you put together a solid case when you eventually request approval from your landlord.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-send-your-landlord-a-written-request-for-approval">4. Send your landlord a written request for approval</h2>



<p>As a paying renter, you are entitled to many <a href="https://ipropertymanagement.com/laws/california-landlord-tenant-rights" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">renters&#8217; rights in California</a>, meaning that you have standard rights that should not be messed around with. That being said, this next stage requires as much formality as possible. You&#8217;ll need to present your request in the best way, and adhere to state laws meticulously. Emails are acceptable, but it&#8217;s more advisable to use certified mail to avoid future conflict.</p>



<p>In your written request, the following should be included:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The start and end dates of the apartment sublet</li><li>The name of the potential subtenant</li><li>The potential subtenant&#8217;s application, including their financial details</li><li>The potential subtenant&#8217;s permanent house address</li><li>Your reason for subletting or moving out permanently</li><li>If applicable, give your new address during the sublet period</li><li>A written consent of any co-tenant</li><li>A copy of the proposed sublease</li></ol>



<p>There are a lot of steps to take, but no one said subletting in Los Angeles, California was easy!</p>

<p>For the first week after submitting, you&#8217;ll need some patience. After that, you can begin to ask for feedback politely. If you still haven&#8217;t gotten a response after thirty days, you can remind them of their &#8216;duty to mitigate&#8217;, stated in Civil Code 1951.2. This term means that a landlord still needs to legally get the rent covered, even if they&#8217;re against sublets. In other words, they&#8217;re still required to accept qualified subtenants to mitigate rent loss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-make-sure-you-collect-the-first-month-of-rent-and-store-it-as-a-security-deposit">6. Make sure you collect the first month of rent and store it as a security deposit</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to avoid any chances of legal hassles or disputes in the subletting process. To stay protected against lost rent, try to get a deposit of a month&#8217;s worth of rent from the subtenant. Be sure to arrange a suitable method for them to pay rent at the end of every month so you can easily transfer the payment to your landlord&#8217;s account.</p>



<p>Subletting in LA, California is no easy ride, but by knowing the many renters&#8217; rights and laws, you can simplify the process somewhat. You don&#8217;t want to risk engaging in an illegal sublet, so always be careful and take things step-by-step!</p>
