<p>There&#8217;s something magical about the fall, and Thanksgiving just adds to that warm and fuzzy feeling. Being able to share it with family and friends really is the icing on the cake. Unfortunately, people who live in small shared spaces often find that they&#8217;re constrained by space. They assume they couldn&#8217;t possibly hold Thanksgiving in a small apartment and so miss out on the opportunity to celebrate with people they love.</p>



<p>Contrary to popular assumption, living in a shared space doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t hold an ‘awemazing’ Thanksgiving dinner. There’s no need to panic. Instead, see hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment as a creative challenge that you CAN overcome! Here are a few tips and tricks on exactly what you need to transform your apartment into Shangri La and enjoy the magic of Thanksgiving with roommates, friends and family.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-plan-in-advance">1. Plan in advance</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Ask yourself the hard questions when you start planning. How much space do I have? Do I have enough tables, chairs, cooking utensils? Would I need to get more? What are my alternatives for the things I don’t have? What can I ask others to bring along? As you answer these questions, a clearer picture of what you can and can&#8217;t do will begin to emerge. It&#8217;s an important first step if you&#8217;re going to successfully host Thanksgiving in a small apartment, so grab a pen and take your time with it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-talk-to-your-roommate-s">2. Talk to your roommate(s)</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

	</div>
	


<p>If you share an apartment with a roommate, then talking to them is one of the first things to do when hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment. Sure, you may all have equal rights to shared spaces but the courtesy of telling your roommate guarantees you a helping hand, and prevents unnecessary arguments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-prepare-a-guest-list">3. Prepare a guest list</h2>

<p>So, you&#8217;ve identified the number of people your apartment can hold. It&#8217;s time to invite those people and confirm if they&#8217;ll be showing up. You should also let them know there’ll be no room for plus ones. This tip helps you avoid surprises in the form of Tinder dates or great aunts when hosting Thanksgiving in your small apartment!</p>



<p>Based on who&#8217;s coming, you can now make decisions about Thanksgiving seating ideas. You may want to set a designated seat at the table for every guest. You may have people coming who don&#8217;t mind eating while sitting on the couch. The confirmed guest list helps you come up with some good Thanksgiving seating ideas.</p>

<p>A chilly season means you have to prepare for your guests&#8217; coats, hats and umbrellas. These can quickly clutter your small space. Designate somewhere in your apartment for people to drop their things. It could be a rolling garment rack you place in the hallway or some space in your closet, or in the worst case, your bed. It may not be the prettiest but it&#8217;ll declutter your living room and dining space and help you better enjoy Thanksgiving with your roommates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-get-some-folding-tables">5. Get some folding tables</h2>

<p>People need tables to eat their Thanksgiving dinner &#8211; right? Chances are that you don&#8217;t have enough. So, you may want to borrow some folding tables to make up for it. Even if the tables don’t match after assembling them, you can get a Thanksgiving tablecloth to hide the mismatch and create some ambiance.</p>

<p>Your kitchen is about to explode with the not-so-nice smell of used dishes, which is why it&#8217;s best to wash as you go along. Consider organizing your dishes into courses so that the period in between courses can be used to quickly wash, dry, and put aside any dishes not in use. That&#8217;ll keep dishes away from valuable serving space. Just make sure you don&#8217;t spend the entire evening in the kitchen. You&#8217;re there to spend time with your loved ones, too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-invest-in-disposable-dishware">7. Invest in disposable dishware</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Alternatively, you could choose to buy disposable dishware when hosting Thanksgiving in your small apartment. You likely don’t have enough space to take all the dishes you’ll need when hosting Thanksgiving in a small kitchen. Likewise, you can’t afford to leave them in your dining area or kitchen once the meal is done.</p>



<p>There is high-end disposable dishware that looks and feels like real china available. Consider getting some so you can easily throw them away as people finish their meals. Done and dusted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-decorate-your-apartment">8. Decorate your apartment</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>You may need to move furniture, clutter, book stacks, or gadgets to create more space. Sometimes moving them to the wall will do. At other times, you may need to move some furniture to the bedroom temporarily.</p>



<p>Likewise, opening up the room with good lighting creates a sense of a larger space. Avoid cluttering the tables with decorative pieces. Instead, consider decorating the walls when hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment. You can also use candles arranged around the room for a warm glow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-be-creative-with-your-meals">9. Be creative with your meals</h2>

<p>You don’t have to be rigid with what you cook for Thanksgiving. It&#8217;s best to consider the space you have and make decisions based on that. For example, a turkey in the oven will force you to keep every other thing out leaving you with little room to cook anything else with the oven. Consider changing up your Thanksgiving dinner menu to use the space you do have in your kitchen.</p>



<p>Additionally, you can let your guests know what you&#8217;re cooking and turn Thanksgiving into a potluck, asking them to bring specific food items as they come. It’s also good to have a plan for dealing with leftovers when hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment.</p>

<p>An exit plan for when everyone is done eating is always nice when hosting Thanksgiving in a small space. It could be that everyone moves outside the house to the balcony, an open space nearby or a local bar for some drinks. Whatever the case, make sure you have a plan in place. It usually is the perfect way to end an amazing Thanksgiving dinner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Thanksgiving is about the conversations, the meals, the laughter, and the gift of friends and family to celebrate with. As long as that is guaranteed, most people don&#8217;t care that they&#8217;re in a small space. So sit back, relax and enjoy your Thanksgiving with roommates and those around you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Any other year, most students would be spending their Thanksgiving break with their families. But this is 2020. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">With Covid-19 in full swing</a>, naturally many will decide to stay put and celebrate thanksgiving without the fam&#8230; but just because you can’t be with your folks doesn’t mean you can’t still have a fantastic Thanksgiving with your roommates!</p>



<p>Known as &#8216;Friendsgiving&#8217; this is no traditional holiday!</p>



<p>Here are a few ways in which you can make the most of Friendsgiving, and make memories that will last a lifetime!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Apartment decor to celebrate Thanksgiving with your roommates</h2>



<p>One of the easiest ways to feel more festive is to spruce up your apartment with festive decor! Scented candles, a wreath, and fall vegetables such as Pumpkins are all great ways to make your apartment look more thanksgiving ready. A super simple (and affordable!) way of making your dining table look fancy is to use the seasonal veggies as centrepieces too. You can even find the candles and a tablecloth from your local thrift store or Goodwill!</p>



<p>Trust us, going out to buy a few budget-friendly things for thanksgiving with your roommates will make the day feel special and get you into the festive mood. Whether you go all out with decor or choose to DIY, there&#8217;s no holiday season without fun and festive decorations! So, use your Thanksgiving break wisely!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dinner Menu to celebrate Thanksgiving with your roommates</h2>



<p>Everyone knows that food is the most important part of any holiday. So, this is the one area where you cannot fall behind! But let’s face it, most college students don’t have the equipment, skill, time or money to make an elaborate Thanksgiving meal. So, get together with your roommates and decide on a simple menu for Thanksgiving. If you don’t feel like doing much cooking at all, it’s completely fine to order some Chinese food or get meals from the supermarket &#8211; treat yourself however you&#8217;d like!</p>



<p>The benefit of celebrating with your roomis is that you don’t have to make things you don’t like eating. Don’t like mashed potatoes? Switch it up with roast potatoes instead. Don’t like turkey? Get chicken roast instead. Don’t like pumpkin pie? Make whatever dessert you want! The point is that you get to decide what you want to eat, so make the most of it! You could also invite your friends (if it&#8217;s safe) and turn dinner into a pot-luck meal.</p>



<p>And don’t forget, it doesn’t have to be perfect. You don’t need to have fancy cutlery sets or matching table mats! The charm of Friendsgiving is that it&#8217;s chill and laid back, so enjoy it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Table Settings</strong></h2>



<p>When planning your table setting for thanksgiving with your roommates, it’s best to keep things minimal and basic. It’s completely fine to use disposable plates, napkins, cups and cutlery- it’s way easier to clean up and adds to the charm of a college Friendsgiving. If you don’t have a dining space or if it’s too small, you could even make a little picnic spot on the floor where everyone can sit and eat. After all, pillows and blankets and your favourite PJ&#8217;s make for a very cozy atmosphere! A formal dinner might feel out-of-place if you’re celebrating with your friends, so ditch the (proverbial) high heels and get comfy!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Entertainment</strong></h2>



<p>No party is complete without entertainment. So, think of some party games that you can play before and after dinner. Whether you play cards, drinking games or good old monopoly, the choices are endless! But be sure to create a playlist for the party so that you can have awesome music playing throughout the night and keep spirits high! Take this time to bond with your roomis, you probably won’t get to spend time with them like this again. That&#8217;s what celebrating thanksgiving with your roommates is all about!</p>



<p>At the end of the day, you need to throw caution to the wind and do what feels good to you and your roomis. Who knows, maybe this Thanksgiving break will be the beginning of a new tradition!</p>

<p>First, take your jar and and cover it in a thin layer of modge podge with your paintbrush. Next, take a leaf and place it on your jar until it sticks. Continue this process until the leaves cover the entire jar. Next, paint another layer of modge podge on top of the leaves so that they stay in place. Let the jar dry. Once it’s dry, place the tea light inside, light the candle&#8230; and voilà! A festive fall candle &#8211; the perfect addition to any room.</p>
