<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Friends (1994-2004)</strong></h3>



<p>One of the most famous TV shows filmed in New York is probably Friends. This light-hearted and heart-warming comedy of six friends living in the city and hanging out in Central Perk is a true New York icon.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seinfeld (1989-1998): Most original of all NYC sitcoms</strong></h3>



<p>Seinfeld is the most classic NYC sitcom, apart from Friends. It may at first appear outdated for millennial audiences, but the everyday and hilarious nuisances of surviving in New York City remain relatable.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="480" height="360" data-attachment-id="11280" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/where-are-the-actual-tv-show-sets-of-nyc-sitcoms/attachment/nyc-sitcom-seinfeld/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nyc-sitcom-seinfeld.gif?fit=480%2C360&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="480,360" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="nyc-sitcom-seinfeld" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nyc-sitcom-seinfeld.gif?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nyc-sitcom-seinfeld.gif?fit=480%2C360&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nyc-sitcom-seinfeld.gif?resize=480%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="seinfeld is the most realistic of all NYC sitcoms" class="wp-image-11280"/></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013-)</strong></h3>



<p>This is one of those NYC sitcoms that sustained due to the large fan base it has gained over the years! The comedy is based on the distinct characters and the petty arguing that goes on in their Brooklyn police precinct between cases.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The truth about NYC sitcoms and their show sets</strong></h2>



<p>A true New Yorker appreciates when TV shows filmed in New York portray the city well. A huge range of films and shows that are shown to be set in The Big Apple isn’t filmed there! So let’s look into where the NYC sitcoms listed above were set in reality.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Central Perk from Friends a real place?</strong></h3>



<p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but this TV show was not filmed in New York at all! <em>Friends</em> was a traditional studio-based NYC sitcom. It was based in Manhattan but filmed across the country in LA. In fact, almost <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/where-is-friends-filmed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything we see</a> was set at the Warner Brothers Ranch in California, including Monica’s apartment and the famous Central Perk.</p>



<p>However, the exterior shots like the building in Greenwich Village, the Vasquez Rocks, and the fountain in the Grand Army Plaza are real locations, which means you can visit them for free, or on one of the various <a href="https://onlocationtours.com/locations/friends/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends walking tours</a> in NYC.</p>

<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Real life Central Perk from Friends plus other spots" width="1250" height="703" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5lM1gPgKxVA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seinfeld: One of the genuine NYC sitcoms out there!</strong></h3>



<p>The 1990’s sitcom “Seinfeld” shows the quirky sides of New York, the city that never sleeps. Creator Larry David wrote the show based partly on his life as a young writer living on the Upper West Side. Several episodes of the classic sitcom include <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://seinfeld.fandom.com/wiki/Jerry%27s_Apartment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real New York City spots</a>. Moreover, the real-life characters like the “soup Nazi”, Monk’s diner, and Yankee Stadium. There is even a bus tour that explores “Seinfeld” venues. How cool!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brooklyn Nine-nine</strong></h3>



<p>While the exterior shots of the police station are authentic footage of Brooklyn&#8217;s 78th Precinct building, this TV show isn’t filmed in New York. Shocking, right?! B99 is currently filmed at <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/986106/brooklyn-nine-nine-season-6-E4-NBC-Fox-location-brooklyn-new-york-los-angeles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS Studio Centre</a>, Los Angeles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gossip Girl</strong></h3>



<p>Unlike the typical TV shows filmed in New York City, “Gossip Girl” followed the lives of the rich adolescents in UES. While the drama follows those characters’ lives, it also features New York City prominently. You get to see several <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/gossip-girl-sites-tour-1612874" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City </a><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/gossip-girl-sites-tour-1612874" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">landmarks</a>. The New York Palace Hotel, the Campbell Apartments, the Museum of the City of New York. Moreover, Columbia University, the Russian Tea Room and much more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sex and The City</strong></h3>



<p>New York itself is constantly in the foreground. However, The Sex and the City interiors were not in Manhattan but in Silvercup Studios East in Queens. There are many tours for movies and especially, TV shows. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://onlocationtours.com/new-york-tv-and-movie-tours/sex-and-the-city-hotspots-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On Location Tours</a> offers a trip devoted specifically to Sex and the City locations starting at $56. The stunning brownstone Carrie lives in, commentary about Staten Island and New Jersey makes us fall in love with New York. Just as Carrie does!</p>
