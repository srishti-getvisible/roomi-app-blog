										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s been a while that most of us have been lucky enough to be working in our PJs from home. And safe to assume, we&#8217;ve come to love this temporary shift of our day job into online jobs. While some of us might be desperately waiting for our social gatherings to go back to normal, one thing most of us are dreading now is the normal work world could resume any day, putting an end to the era of work from home jobs. And before we know it, it will demand our presence in the offices for a major chunk of our time in the day. Therefore, our only plausible escape remains to Google &#8216;freelance jobs for beginners&#8217; or &#8216;freelance jobs for students&#8217; wondering if we can make it a full-time career.</p>



<p>So is it possible to continue working from home, even after the pandemic is over? Maybe you&#8217;ve been going to work all along, even amidst a pandemic on the rise. Or maybe you were let go because of the pandemic and had no other choice but to find online jobs to pay the bills (and have now come to love it.)</p>



<p>Whatever your reason, you&#8217;re here for an answer. So let&#8217;s deep dive into the possibilities, as well as the pros and the cons of becoming a (full-time) freelancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-anyone-become-a-freelancer">Can anyone become a freelancer?</h2>



<p>That surely depends on the kind of work you do for a living. Additionally, the conditions of being a freelancer would also vary with the kind of occupation you do. With the internet boom and most work requiring just a laptop and a stable internet connection, it is quite possible to find online jobs across all fields.</p>



<p>However, if your work requires physical presence, you can still look at becoming a freelancer. If not for finding work-from-home jobs, it can allow you the possibility of setting your own hours in the least.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-pros-of-working-from-home">What are the pros of working from home? </h2>



<p>Excited? Let&#8217;s look at a few pros of becoming a freelancer. We will also tell you about how to look for freelance jobs for beginners. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-have-the-freedom-to-make-your-own-schedule">You have the freedom to make your own schedule</h3>



<p>The number one reason for hating your regular 9-5 could be well.. the 9 &#8211; 5. You have to clock in at a certain time. You can&#8217;t leave before a certain time. And you have to deal with all the drama that ensues in between.</p>



<p>But when you&#8217;re a freelancer with work from home jobs, you aren&#8217;t as time-bound as you are at a regular job. No one can demand you to clock in or clock out. And all you need to keep in mind is submission of your work within the deadlines.</p>



<p>But stay wary though. You either have to have super organizational skills and be a self-motivator or have to be willing to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn those skills</a> to make it as a freelancer. Otherwise, you&#8217;d end up working online jobs ALL DAY LONG. And being in your PJs wouldn&#8217;t help even a tad bit.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-will-have-to-look-for-online-jobs">You will have to look for online jobs</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s not easy. But thanks to the pandemic (can&#8217;t believe we can actually write that), <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are a lot more online jobs</a> than before. So becoming a freelancer or looking for work from home jobs can give you better results now, owing to the increased numbers of such online jobs.</p>



<p>But that said, you still have to put in a lot of effort to find a good job that pays well and doesn&#8217;t exploit your time or energy. Especially if you&#8217;re looking at freelance jobs for beginners. And oftentimes, you have to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/do-this-while-you-wait-to-hear-from-a-job-interview-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">wait for a long time to hear back</a> from a potential job.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-and-how-exactly-do-you-find-a-job-online">And how exactly do you find a job online?</h4>



<p>There are several basic ways to look for online jobs, but you&#8217;d have to do it all simultaneously to increase your chances of finding a good fit.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trusted-job-portals">Trusted job portals</h5>



<p>Spruce up your resume and stay active on portals such as LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Upwork</a>, Fiverr, etc. Make a kickass portfolio and keep it ready to send through when you get in touch with a potential client.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-media-websites-and-groups">Social media websites and groups</h5>



<p>A lot of employers are looking for people on social media &#8211; especially for marketing-related roles. So join some groups that post online jobs. You will find plenty work from home jobs, freelance jobs for students, and freelance jobs for beginners on such groups. The next step is to stay active in these groups.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tap-into-your-network">Tap into your network </h5>



<p>If you know people who work in the HR department, consider getting in touch with them for potential work from home jobs. Connect with previous colleagues and ask around if they personally know any freelancers or people looking for freelancers. Knowing freelancers will help you enter this world and find online jobs for yourself!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-are-there-any-downsides-to-being-a-full-time-freelancer">So are there any downsides to being a full-time freelancer?</h2>



<p>Now before you&#8217;re determined to find your dream online jobs, let&#8217;s look at a few downsides that you need to be aware of. However tempting it may seem, the truth is, that it&#8217;s not for everyone.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beware-of-scams-when-looking-for-online-jobs">Beware of scams when looking for online jobs</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, with an increase in demand for online jobs, a bigger scam employment market has crept up online. So you have to be extra careful when looking for work from home jobs and freelance jobs for students. Stay wary of all red flags so you don&#8217;t become a victim in these troubling times. Especially if you&#8217;re on the lookout for freelance jobs for beginners.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understand-the-process-of-making-money-in-online-jobs">Understand the process of making money in online jobs</h3>



<p>Firstly, your payments will be irregular, depending on the type of clients, and how many of those you have. Many freelancers find managing administrative tasks difficult. One such task is generating and sending invoices for completed work. Thankfully, there are tools available to streamline this process, such as <a href="https://www.invoicesimple.com/invoice-template/excel-invoice-template" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">invoice templates for Excel</a>. These templates can simplify billing and payments, allowing freelancers to focus more on their core activities rather than manual calculations.</p>



<p>Secondly, you will be responsible for your own payments when working online jobs. You&#8217;ll be sending invoices and following up with the client in case of delay &#8211; as opposed to a regular paycheck at the same time every month at a regular job. And one thing all freelancers dread &#8211; you&#8217;d also have to learn to do your own taxes!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-accept-the-job-insecurity-that-comes-with-it">Accept the job insecurity that comes with it</h3>



<p>Because of a lack of personal relationship with your client and lack of accountability, you have less job security when you&#8217;re freelancing. And it can be rather erratic to find and sustain online jobs and freelance jobs for students.</p>



<p>In conclusion, becoming a freelancer comes with its risks. But if you&#8217;re determined to become a successful freelancer, you shall become one!</p>



<p>Good luck to you.</p>
