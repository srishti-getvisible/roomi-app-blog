<p>Average rent in Cupertino is expensive but high salaries go some way towards compensating. The city frequently illustrates&nbsp;how the valley&#8217;s finest markets function. That&#8217;s because it provides a short commute to key tech facilities, excellent schools, and houses that are (usually) neither too elaborate nor extravagant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top Neighborhoods in Cupertino</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Creston:</strong> The well-kept environment and calm ambiance are part of why Crestonians appreciate living in this area. Located on the outskirts of Cupertino and Los Altos, the streets are broad and well-paved, with walkways that are favorable to pedestrians.</li><li><strong>Garden Gate:</strong> The majority of Garden Gate&#8217;s homes are well-built Ranch-style homes that are progressively being replaced by new developments. Regardless of whether the house is old or new, most have nice lawns. Moreover, you&#8217;ll find shaded places and modern walkways that provide beautiful settings for walks.</li><li><strong>Monta Vista:</strong> This is one of Cupertino&#8217;s most desirable communities. Its ideal location, low crime rates, and high-performing schools all contribute to the neighborhood&#8217;s appeal. Thus, it is relatively hard to find cheap rooms for rent in Cupertino here.</li></ul>
