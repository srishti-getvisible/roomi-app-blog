Whether you&#8217;re a recent college graduate or you’ve just decided to move out from your parent&#8217;s home, the idea of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/living-alone-for-the-first-time/">having a whole place to yourself</a> sounds exciting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stackumbrella.com%2Fessentials-for-renting-the-first-apartment%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3nZshKyY6sELnNnS7ABq1i&amp;ust=1646748073441000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAwQjhxqFwoTCICv4uSUtPYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ">Source</a></p>



<p>Spending the first few nights (or months, even) in your first apartment without having the essentials could leave you feeling uncomfortable or out of place. Usually, most people need to camp out in their new apartment for some time before all of their stuff arrives.</p>



<p>No matter what your reason is, you need to have several essentials readily available, so you don&#8217;t beat yourself over not having them later on.</p>



<p>It may seem overwhelming, but these must-have items will make the first days in your home convenient and enjoyable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-1-mattress">1. Mattress</h3>



<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be nice to sleep on the cold, hard floor, so buying a comfy mattress and sheets should be the first thing you do. If you really like to feel relaxed, throw in your duvet, comforter, pillows, and anything else you think will make for a good night’s rest.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-2-important-furniture">2. Important furniture</h3>



<p>Say a family member or friend comes over to check out your awesome place. Where would they sleep? This is why it’s good to invest in important <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/affordable-furniture-shops-when-living-in-nyc/">sleeping</a> furniture like a couch or even a sleeper sofa before fully moving into your apartment.</p>



<p>And we can’t possibly forget your table and chairs! Except you’re a couch potato, it’ll be nice to have somewhere to eat that’s not on the sofa. If you feel this is too much, you can buy some barstools or even a coffee table instead. Renting is also a great option to try, especially if you’re forecasting shifting houses frequently.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-3-chargers">3. Chargers</h3>



<p>Carry all the chargers for every essential electronic device in your possession such as your phone, laptop, tablet, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-4-or-invest-in-some-spare-batteries">4. Or invest in some spare batteries</h3>



<p>If you have any important items that are non-rechargeable, then hold on to some spare batteries so that you don’t get stranded.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-5-kitchen-and-food-supplies">5. Kitchen and food supplies</h3>



<p>Buying takeout every day will cost you a lot of money in the long run, so why not get the necessary kitchen supplies so you can cook and eat comfortably? You don’t have to pack so much food, but get some easy-to-make staples like pasta and sauce, a few boxes of your favorite cereal and milk, bread and peanut butter, canned soup, etc.</p>



<p>You’ll also need to buy beverages like bottled water, tea bags, and coffee.</p>



<p>Depending on how long you plan on staying, you can buy some snacks too, especially those that don’t require preparation or refrigeration, like granola and nuts.</p>



<p>If you don’t want to use paper plates and cups, buy pots, pans, a strainer, a can opener, a vegetable peeler, knives, utensils, plates, kitchen towels, oven mitt, and whatever else you think will make eating and cooking easy for you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-6-basic-cleaning-supplies">6. Basic Cleaning Supplies</h3>



<p>Make sure you have the basic cleaning supplies ready so that you don’t deal with too much to clean on the move-in day. Get glass cleaners, multi-surface cleaners like white vinegar, dish soap, rags, a broom and dustpan, paper towels, and trash bags.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-7-a-basic-first-aid-kit">7. A Basic First Aid Kit</h3>



<p>It’s possible to get a few nicks or injuries as you move things around. We dearly hope you don’t. This is why you should be ready with Band-Aids, antibiotic ointment, a thermometer, anti-inflammatory like Advil, tweezers, some antiseptic wipes, an Ace bandage, and a few ibuprofen.</p>



<p>If you have any medication you take daily, then you should stock up or ensure there’s a place you can get them near your apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-8-keys">8. Keys</h3>



<p>If you tend to lose your keys, get spare ones made and keep them in safe places that you won’t easily forget.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-9-clothes">9. Clothes</h3>



<p>Seems pretty obvious, doesn&#8217;t it? Still, make sure you pack enough clothing for your brief stay before all your stuff comes in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-10-toiletries">10. Toiletries</h3>



<p>You may not be living in the apartment fully, but you need to take care of yourself. Don’t forget to pack important toiletries like soap, shampoo, moisturizing cream, shaving cream, toothbrush and toothpaste, deodorant, plus towels and washcloths for cleaning up.</p>



<p>Also, get yourself a tube of sunblock. You most likely would spend a lot of time in the sun trying to run errands and getting yourself together before you finally move in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-11-a-small-home-toolkit">11. A Small Home Toolkit</h3>



<p>Don’t underestimate having basic tools like a hammer, screwdriver, pliers, some duct tape, scissors, and even a step stool. They can come in handy during your short stay and even move-in day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-12-flashlight-or-headlamp">12. Flashlight or Headlamp</h3>



<p>It’s always good to carry candles or a flashlight in your first apartment. If there’s ever a power outage, the above will keep you from banging into stuff and stumbling in darkness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-13-important-documents-and-phone-numbers">13. Important Documents and Phone Numbers</h3>



<p>It’s good to be well prepared, so you should bring along&nbsp;important documents such as your driver’s license, passport, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi/">lease</a> (if applicable), etc. You’ll also need some paper and pens to make to-do lists.</p>



<p>Make sure your contact list has the phone numbers of your moving company, your financial institutions like your bank and insurance company, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/">your landlord</a>, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-14-credit-cardcash">14. Credit Card/Cash</h3>



<p>Don’t forget to carry your credit card(s) along. Keep some cash with you as well, in case something pops up, and you need to take care of it quickly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="15-15-a-treat">15. A treat</h3>



<p>Let’s face it: moving into an apartment isn’t easy. With all the heavy lifting and walking around that awaits you during move-in day, nobody would blame you for trying to treat yourself first.</p>



<p>Do anything that makes you feel relaxed, like reading a book, enjoying a good movie, or even sipping some wine. It’ll go a long way in relieving stress and helping you get accustomed to living in your new apartment.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone has a different idea of home, and in order to make your new place feel like yours, you&#8217;re going to want to start by deep cleaning all the surfaces.</strong> Whether you&#8217;re renting an apartment, townhouse, or even a fully furnished loft, it&#8217;s best to start from scratch &#8211; cleaning floors, wiping windows, and scrubbing the tiles and mirrors in the bathroom(s). This way, you&#8217;ll be able to visualize the clean space as your own, which means you can start thinking about where you&#8217;ll keep your plants or make a resting space for your pets.</p>

<p>The coat rail is by the window, the pantry is freshly stocked, and the fresh linen smells lovely. Now, it&#8217;s time to unpack. We recommend doing this in small sections, room by room, to make this big job feel more manageable. <strong>For example, the first things you&#8217;ll want to unpack are your duvet and pillows, so you get a good night&#8217;s sleep in your new apartment!</strong></p>

<p>When you are moving to a new neighborhood, it is important for you to make a note of the local emergency phone numbers and addresses, for example, the nearest ER. Having these saved on your phone will save you from having to look them up when you really need them. Tick off one box on your moving in checklist by collating numbers and addresses for the police department, nearby hospitals, the fire department, and other emergency services now.</p>

<p>When it comes time to file your taxes, you&#8217;ll thank yourself for having kept all of your moving expenses and receipts in one place. In fact, it&#8217;s better to keep all your paperwork together, so you know where everything is when you need it. This is an important box to tick off on your moving in checklist, especially if you expect to write off any of those expenses on your income taxes.</p>

<p>Doing an inventory might not be high on your priority list, particularly if you&#8217;re exhausted from all the unpacking. However, making a list of everything in your new apartment helps to make sure that all your items have made it there safely and that you haven’t lost anything in transit. Furthermore, if you hired movers, compiling a home inventory is essential, because you may need to make a claim for lost or damaged property.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t want to be cold all through the winter or the sweat through your shirts in the summer, you will need to pay for utilities like water and heating. Utilities also include electricity and your internet connection. If you’re moving to a new city, state, or country, disconnecting and reconnecting utilities can be a bit of a hassle. However, the process is relatively simple if you keep track of which services need to be disconnected and where and when they can be reconnected.</p>

<p>Phew! After all the unpacking, organizing, and filing, you probably need a day or two to recover from the exhaustion. However, stay with us for one last thing &#8211; you won&#8217;t know how many keys are floating around for your new apartment until you get new locks or re-key the existing ones. If you&#8217;ve ever lived in a house where the previous owners gave out keys to everyone who asked, you&#8217;ll know how easy it can be for someone to waltz in and steal your valuables.</p>



<p>Changing the locks and keys to your new apartment is the final box to tick on your moving-in checklist for your own safety and the protection of your home.</p>

<p>The pandemic has made us all realize how important every second of our life is. It&#8217;s also made many of us re-evaluate our decisions &#8211; and reposition our priorities! Maybe taking up that fancy job actually wasn&#8217;t what you really wanted&#8230; maybe what you wanted was a life full of adventures and to move to a new city! So if you&#8217;re planning to live in a different continent, city, or country but don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re ready? Then watch out for these 6 signs that tell you that you&#8217;re ready to shift cities. If you find yourself nodding at any point while reading this, get ready for your next adventure!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. You haven&#8217;t lived anywhere else but you always wanted to move to a new city</h2>



<p>So you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s never moved anywhere else before. The chances are you either hate it&#8230; or love it &#8211; but you&#8217;re definitely wondering what else is out there. There&#8217;s definitely a certain thrill in moving cities, meeting new people, and experiencing different cultures first hand. The unknown can seem really intimidating at first, but once you get settled in a new place, you&#8217;ll probably wonder why you didn&#8217;t move any sooner!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. You&#8217;re looking to start a new life</h2>



<p>Do you have sour and bitter memories attached to the city you&#8217;re living in currently? Maybe the memories from a bad break up or an awful job role keep playing on your mind? Then it could be time to pack your bags and bid Adieu to your current town! And remember, you&#8217;re not running away from your past, you&#8217;re giving yourself a chance to start afresh.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. You want to move closer to your loved ones</h2>



<p>It could be a college degree, a relationship, or even a job that took you away from your loved ones, and now the pandemic is making you re-evaluate your decision. You&#8217;ve realized that college lessons are online, your relationship kind of sucks, and that your job is becoming a little draining. Your loved ones are waiting and your hometown is calling; can you hear it singing?&nbsp;*<em>Sings Sweet Home Alabama </em>*</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. You want a change of scene or a better quality of life and moving cities is on your mind </h2>



<p>You&#8217;re done with the city life &#8211; the booming rent, the hustle, and the concrete jungle. Maybe you want to live a more relaxed lifestyle, and you definitely don&#8217;t see that materializing in a busy city. If you&#8217;re aching to settle in a suburb, the countryside, or in a quaint town then you&#8217;re definitely ready to shift cities. Life is short, don&#8217;t exist but live it to the fullest.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. You want to explore the city of your dreams</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ve always dreamt of moving to Chicago, Los Angeles, or New York as a kid. The <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/movies-that-capture-chicago-perfectly-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movies that you watched of your favorite cities only fed your desire to start a life there</a>. Now you&#8217;re a grown-up with a job <em>(congratulations little dreamer)</em>! While adulting can be tough, it comes with many benefits like the freedom to make decisions as big as moving cities. Make your childhood dream a reality and take a leap of faith backed with financial planning and career options like a real adult!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. You&#8217;re ready to move to a new city, but can&#8217;t decide where</h2>



<p>You&#8217;re certain that you need to move to a new city, but you&#8217;re struggling to decide where. With so many amazing cities out there, it can be overwhelming to decide which one will be perfect for you.</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s what you need to do to make this process of moving cities seamless and less frustrating:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Make a list of things/experiences that you&#8217;d like in your new city.</li>



<li>What sort of weather would you like &#8211; cool &amp; pleasant or warm &amp; sunny?</li>



<li>Now mark the things which are an absolute necessity as &#8220;must haves&#8221; &#8211; this will help you narrow your expectations from a city/town/country and help you find the most ideal one.</li>
</ol>
