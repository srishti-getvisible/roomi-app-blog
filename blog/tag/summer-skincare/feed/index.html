<p>Our skin goes through a lot during the year. And as you might know, summers can be a different kind of challenging for our skin. Warm weather brings a whole slew of skincare questions, and if there was one answer to all of them, it&#8217;s the following. You have to have a basic skincare routine, and depending on the weather, you should be switching up the products based on what they&#8217;re meant to do. There should ideally be a couple of changes that one incorporated, transitioning from winter to summer. Here&#8217;s everything you should be doing in your summer skincare routine!</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/why-is-my-skin-breaking-out-in-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Help! Why Is My Skin Breaking Out Even In Quarantine?</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Drop the heavy weight routine.</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re not wearing heavy clothes in the summer, then why should your skin? In the summer, be sure to focus on lightweight products made to get the job done. The heat and humidity of summer mean you can swap out a heavier cleanser (think cream or oil cleanser) in favor of a gentle, foaming option.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make your moisturizer dual purpose!</h2>



<p>Combining moisturizer and SPF could be the answer you&#8217;re looking for when thinking of lightening up your skincare routine. For most areas and people, an SPF over 30 should be enough. It&#8217;s also important to note that heavier products can lead to the clogging of pores, inflammation, and acne. Especially if you have acne-prone or oily skin, losing one skin-care step with a combination moisturizer/SPF can help keep skin clear.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/tips-for-keeping-your-skin-healthy-during-winter-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tips for Keeping Your Skin Healthy During the Winter Months</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But NEVER skip on the moisturizing.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.pexels.com/photos/3851905/pexels-photo-3851905.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="person holding a face mask for hydration in the summer for their skincare "/></figure>



<p>The extra layer of sweat that accumulates over our skin during the summer months DOES NOT count as moisturiser. Even if you&#8217;re in the most humid temperatures and your skin feels oily, you need your moisturiser.</p>



<p>The main purpose of a moisturizer is to replenish and re-establish the outermost layer of your skin. This then protects the skin from external pollutants that can become the cause irritation and dryness. This is where that combination moisturizer/SPF comes in: A lightweight texture will help keep that outer layer nourished without feeling too heavy on your skin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Give your skin a solid vitamin C serum treatment.</h2>



<p>Vitamin C is important all year round, but it becomes essential in the summers. If you have oily skin, you can pair this up with exfoliation for the pores. This doesn&#8217;t mean you go overboard with your favorite acids, but maybe try slowly increasing the number of days you exfoliate per week.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure your makeup is non-comedogenic!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.pexels.com/photos/4046314/pexels-photo-4046314.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman sitting on the floor in front of her mirror trying on makeup "/></figure>



<p>This is a really important one. Take a close look at your makeup product labels and only keep those that are non-comedogenic. That&#8217;s a fancy word for a product formulated without pore-clogging ingredients. Especially over the summer, try only using products that are made to suit your skin type!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stay in the shade ?</h2>



<p>Sun protective clothing is important, and we love wide brim hats paired with the funkiest glasses. These don&#8217;t just make fun additions to our wardrobes, but can be put to great use in the summers! Be mindful to expose as little of your body as possible to direct sunlight. That might mean sitting underneath an umbrella, wearing an extra-large hat, or avoiding the midday sun.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HYDRATE HYDRATE AND HYDRATE SOME MORE.</h2>



<p>Water literally solves half our bodily woes. Truly. Aim for eight glasses of water a day, which can do wonders for your skin. Hydration can also help skin recover after a sunburn — but we know you&#8217;re all too smart to get those in the first place.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">SPF, please!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.pexels.com/photos/3618606/pexels-photo-3618606.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="Woman Seated on a mat at the beach Applying sunscreen on herself to save her skin from the harsh UVA and UVB rays"/></figure>



<p>Yeah, we kept the holy grail tip for summer skincare for the end. Everyone could do good with some 30+ SPF (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-your-spf-15-sunscreen-probably-isn-t-enough-to-prot-1827859118">Yeah, those SPF 15s don&#8217;t really work anymore</a>). It is also important to note that sunscreen needs to be reapplied every couple of hours, so make sure to pack extra sunscreen for long summer days outdoors. You could also set reminders on your phone to remind yourself to apply sunscreen!</p>
