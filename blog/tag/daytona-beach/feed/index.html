<p>The Daytona Beach area was originally home to the indigenous Timucuan Indians, who lived in fortified villages. Later home to the Orange Grove Plantation, it was bought by Mathias Day Jr. in 1871. There, he established a hotel, around which the town grew. However, Day lost the deed to the land after running into financial trouble. But locals still named the town Daytona in his honor.</p>



<p>Daytona Beach has a humid subtropical climate, with two major seasons. Hence, there is the warmer, wetter season (May-October) and the cooler and drier season (November-April). While the weather is mostly stable, there can be occasional adversities. Therefore, watch out for tropical storms or hurricanes if you are looking for rooms for rent in Daytona Beach.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Airports</h3>



<p>Daytona Beach has passenger airline services located at the <a href="http://www.flydaytonafirst.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daytona Beach International Airport</a> (DAB). American Airlines and Delta Airlines offer flights to the city with non-stop service to Charlotte and Atlanta. However, keep in mind that options are limited if you are flying into Daytona Beach. If you are flying in to find cheap rooms for rent in Daytona Beach, <a href="https://orlandoairports.net/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orlando International Airport</a> and <a href="http://www.flyjacksonville.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacksonville International Airport</a> have more flight options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Taxis</h3>



<p>Taxis in Daytona Beach are generally safe, and cheaper when compared to other cities. However, you may run into difficulties finding one in certain places or late at night. Hence, it makes sense to book one in advance. Ride-sharing apps like <a href="https://m.uber.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Uber</a> and <a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lyft</a> are also available, which can be handy if you are looking for cheap rooms for rent in Daytona Beach in an out-of-the-way area.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><thead><tr><th>Taxi rates for</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Taxi 1 Hour Waiting (Normal Tariff)</td><td>$30</td></tr><tr><td>Taxi Start (Normal Tariff) </td><td>$3.20</td></tr><tr><td>Taxi 1km (Normal Tariff) </td><td>$0.93</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Buses</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.greyhound.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greyhound</a> buses are a great option if you want to reach Daytona Beach by bus and have regular service to the city. Buses in the city are operated by the <a href="http://www.votran.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Volusia County Public Transit System (Votran).</a> It runs fixed-route buses as well as paratransit services throughout the entire county. Single rides are $1.75 per trip and a 24-hour pass costs $3.75. Hence, it&#8217;s a great way to get around the city if you are finding rooms for rent in Daytona Beach.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Railways</h3>



<p>With the passenger railway being set up in Daytona Beach in 1889, it remains a great way to get to the city. <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Amtrak</a> offers regular passenger service with the closest stop being near DeLand. However, a Thruway Motorcoach connection between the beachside and Amtrak&#8217;s DeLand Station connects the two cities.</p>
