										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>No doubt about it — moving to a new city is a life-changing decision that feels both exciting and scary. There are a lot of things you need to consider: rent, cost of living, the livability of the city, type of neighborhood, and more. These factors can cause quite a hassle, but coupled with the thought of finding a good roommate? Now, that’s immensely stressful.</p>



<p>With a city as big as New York, there are a ton of ways to look for roommates. There isn&#8217;t a lack of websites for this purpose, but there sure are certain features and elements that set the best apart from the basics.</p>



<p>Sure, you’ll have Facebook groups and Craigslist posts to explore. However, a more advisable way to find good roommates is by using roommate finder apps like Roomster, or the Roomster alternative, Roomi.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-roomster-vs-roomi-main-differences">Roomster vs Roomi: Main Differences</h2>



<p>Don’t worry about the stress of seeking the best roommate finder; we’ve done so for you!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are These Roommate Finder Apps Free or Paid?</h3>



<p>Roomi definitely comes out on top when compared with other roommate finder websites. This is because Roomi has no monthly subscription fees, no costs for messaging, and signing up and listing a space on Roomi is free. It’s even free to search for a place to rent.</p>



<p>However, to get the absolute best out of Roomi, it’s advisable to subscribe to its paid services. Roomi has three available subscription plans: the Premium plan for personal use, the Solo Agent, and the Business Unlimited plan for business users.</p>



<p>These paid plans include background checks, identity verifications, messaging plans, listing credits, profile boosts, and listing boosts. All of these are tailored to your needs with the following benefits:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Access to unlimited messages and swipes in your search for potential roommates</li>



<li>Post five to unlimited active listings simultaneously.</li>



<li>Free bookings</li>



<li>Fully verified status upgrade</li>



<li>Ability to boost listings with subscriptions</li>
</ol>



<p>Roomster allows users to pay for a 3-day subscription, which is enough to test the app. But a Roomster subscription costs $9.99 to $49.99. The subscription is automatically renewed after a month unless you cancel it manually. And based on some Roomster reviews, several users have complained about the exorbitant fees charged for things like viewing messages.</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/is-roomi-free-to-use/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Is Roomi free to use?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust">Security: Can These Apps Help Me Find Roommates I Can Trust?</h3>



<p>If you want to live with another person in a new city, it’s vital that you find someone who&#8217;s trustworthy and safe. Sharing your living space with another person is a big deal.</p>



<p>You would probably like to live with someone who takes hygiene seriously, respects boundaries, and is reliable. This is where roommate finders come in. Roommate finder apps such as Roomster and Roomi are great, but it’s normal to ask questions like, ‘Is Roomster legit?’ or ‘How well is my profile protected?’.</p>



<p><strong>ID and Contact Infomation Verification</strong></p>



<p>Roomster allows users to verify their identity using social media, email addresses, phone numbers, and identification with a simple process. However, due to voice-over-IP services, it has provided a entryway for scammers. Also, verifying your identity with Roomster isn&#8217;t an appealing process. Roomster requires you to send a scanned picture of your verification, then pay $14.99 to begin ID verification.</p>



<p>Moreover, Roomster reviews regarding the quality of ID Verification have not been positive, with users concerned about the additional fee required for identity verification. But with Roomster&#8217;s alternative, Roomi, identity verification comes with your subscription.</p>



<p>In order to assure users’ safety, Roomi makes sure to verify the identity of every user on the platform. Users are required to submit a government issued-ID before they can become verified users. And with this, you get a verified badge that&#8217;s useful in speeding up your search for a roommate.</p>



<p>Additionally, Roomi makes use of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/more-information-about-global-id/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">GlobaliD</a>, a digital identity platform that puts you in control of your identity and your data. With GlobaliD, you can have your number and email verified by Roomi, while your privacy is assured.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy and Security of Profiles</strong></p>



<p>Roomster allows you to create a profile where you can post stories, pictures and social media links to its community. They also ensure that all the information you add is authentic.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://roomiapp.com/how_it_works" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Roomi</a></p>



<p>Roomi, however, allows users to share meaningful information that makes all the difference when searching for roommates. Visible information on a Roomi profile includes age, profile photo(s), preferred location, budget (if entered), move-in date, summary, work info, interests, roommate preferences, lifestyle, and more.</p>



<p>Roomi also offers its users secure in-app messaging, keeping the information shared between you and your potential roommate private. Another reason Roomi stands out as a great roommate finder app is that you can request for the deletion of all personal information after successfully finding a roommate. Users can do this under the General Data Protection Regulation Act by contacting <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/how-do-i-delete-my-account-on-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Roomi customer support</a>, or by filling out a form.</p>



<p><strong>24/7 Support &amp; Content Moderation</strong></p>



<p>It’s definitely disappointing to think you’re well on your way to finding a roommate while using a roommate finder app, only to realize that it’s not legit. You don;t have to worry about that with Roomi, as the platform has an in-house moderation team that works to remove spam profiles and fake listers from the platform.</p>



<p>24/7 customer support is also provided with an enlightening <a href="https://roomiapp.com/faq" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FAQ page</a> to answer all your questions and make your roommate searching easier.</p>



<p>Roomster provides customer service as well, yet some reviews say that they weren&#8217;t as useful, nor as around the clock as Roomi&#8217;s customer service.</p>



<p><strong>Criminal Background Check</strong></p>



<p>Roomi does optional <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/what-weve-learned-from-processing-over-100000-background-checks/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">criminal background checks</a> by Garbo<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for user profiles so that you know who you’ll be living with. Submitting your profile to Roomi for a criminal background check helps to boost roommate matches.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">User Profiles: Which App Makes It Easier to Find Your Perfect Roommate?</h3>



<p>Most people have fallen victim to phony Craigslist ads and scammers on Facebook while searching for rooms for rent and roommates. With all this in mind, Roomi made it a priority to make the process easier and stress-free. Both Roomster vs Roomi are great, but Roomi definitely takes the cake when you compare their features.</p>



<p>With Roomi, you can filter choices for potential roommates. It may be awkward to ask a potential roommate some specific questions, which is why Roomi has provided the option of filtering roommates based on neighborhood, gender, budget, location, and more. With Roomi’s roommate matching algorithm, you can be sure of finding a roommate perfect for you. Roomi has an age filter, an LGBTQ+-friendly filter, and even a house rules filter.</p>



<p>Even more, using Roomi is a breeze! Here&#8217;s how:</p>



<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Log in to your Roomi account.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>From the homepage, put in your location, then click &#8216;Renter&#8217; to find potential roommates around the area. You can also choose your filters (gender, age, maximum budget, etc.) to narrow down your search.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Roomi will then show you a list of potential roommates based on your applied filters. All you have to do now is send a message through Roomi&#8217;s in-app messaging feature and you&#8217;re all set.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As it is, spare rooms are frequently left unused, or they become a dumping ground for stuff&nbsp;that has no other place to go. They are usually the smallest room in the house, so it&#8217;s a challenge to find its purpose. However, with a little planning and intelligent placing, you can create a home to be proud of. And no, we&#8217;re not talking about the regular spare room ideas with a guest room or home office. We believe a spare bedroom can be used for a variety of purposes, including practicing a hobby, creating a play area for your children, and even subletting it to create a new source of income.</p>

<p>You can transform an empty room into an art studio or hobby area, whether you enjoy sewing, stamp collecting, or playing the guitar. To make the space ready, all it needs is a little paint, some storage containers, and perhaps a work table.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-your-very-own-home-gym">3. Your very own home gym!</h2>



<p>Is your treadmill in the living room becoming a pile-up? To establish a dedicated workout space, move it to an empty room with your other exercise equipment. Position a full-length mirror against one of the walls to help you perfect your technique. You might discover that when your equipment is all ready to go, you&#8217;ll want to get moving more often.</p>

<p>Have you ever imagined yourself like Belle from &#8220;Beauty and the Beast,&#8221; whirling around in your own private library surrounded by towering bookshelves? If you don&#8217;t have enough space in your living room for a home library, your spare bedroom will suffice. Arrange shelves along the walls and set aside a place for the most comfortable chair you can find.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-garden-your-space">5. Garden your space</h2>



<p>Among excellent spare room ideas that help our environment is gardening! Gardeners without the space or cash for a greenhouse can grow seedlings in their spare bedroom from the end of winter to the beginning of spring. Purchase readymade shelves or build your own, and be sure to use lights that help plants to flourish.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-walk-in-closet">6. Walk-in closet!</h2>



<p>If your style is a priority, the extra room could double up as a classic dressing room. Consider this: a vanity, shoe and accessory organizers, and a myriad of mirrors. A vintage screen and elaborate lighting finish off this interior to perfection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-play-game-room">7. Play/game room</h2>



<p>If you have children, you might want to consider turning the extra room into a playroom. Arrange their toys to create a large space for them to play and be active.</p>



<p>Consider investing in a wide area rug to make sitting on the floor more comfortable. Make sure there are enough arts and crafts in the room in case of a stormy day. The best part of all? You won&#8217;t find as many toys thrown around your living room, bathroom and garden!</p>



<p>Game rooms are also among the most fantasized spare room ideas for bachelors! You can design a dedicated game room with comfortable chairs and a wide table that can hold huge boards. Set up a console zone with beanbag seats if you&#8217;re a big player. Add a mini-fridge packed with game-night beverages for a luxurious touch, and you&#8217;re good to go!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-brainstorm-area">8. Brainstorm area</h2>



<p>Having a proper space&nbsp;to work out your ideas, whether you&#8217;re a writer or an entrepreneur, is vital. Convert your spare room into an area&nbsp;with whiteboards and plenty of blank wall space where you can plan out your ideas and let your imagination run wild. It doesn&#8217;t have to be an office, but rather a place where you can be yourself!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Opting for a roommate isn&#8217;t just about saving money on rent and utilities. It is about finding companionship in a new environment. It is about security in a place where you have no one else. What this means is that beyond just having a roommate, having the right roommate is equally important.</p>



<p>While there may be a lot of guesswork and grunt work in using a website like Craiglist to find roommates, using a roommate finder like Roomi or Nooklyn is a better way to find the right roomies. But you know no two applications are ever exactly the same. Often, they’ll differ in features and service specifications. To decide which is the better roommate finder between Roomi and Nooklyn, let us take a look at several key features.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are these roommate finder apps free or paid?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>Generally speaking, living in a metro city is expensive. You want to cut down costs on as many fronts as possible. Besides this, you also want to make sure you get the best value for whatever money you spend.</p>



<p>While it may be okay to quickly settle for a free roommate finder service for this reason, you must bear in mind that many free websites in this category expose their users to scams and spam. Thus, they must be used with extreme caution.</p>



<p>Nooklyn may be an apartment hunting website but it also has a roommate finder service that is free to use. Once you’ve signed up and verified your identity, you can start browsing for potential roommates. Know that you still have to do the work of finding someone who matches your interests and preferences.</p>



<p>Nooklyn alternative, Roomi, also has a free subscription plan. As a free user, you can send up to 5 messages/swipes daily. However, Roomi also recently launched a Roomi Gold subscription plan. For a weekly fee of $14.99 and a monthly fee of $21.99, you have an improved chance of finding a safe roomie that matches your preferences perfectly.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-trust">Security: Can these apps help me find roommates I trust?</h2>

<p>When you&#8217;ve recently moved to a new location, security is often a concern. Beyond staying in a safe neighborhood, you want to be sure your apartment is secure. If you happen to stay with someone, you want to know that your roommate is trustworthy. The question to ask then is which apps can help you find a roommate you can trust? The Roomi app or the Nooklyn app? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="verification-of-roommate-contact-info">Verification of roommate contact info</h3>



<p><strong>Nooklyn</strong> is particular about verifying the contact info of its users. If you plan to use this <strong>roommate finder</strong> service, you will need to verify your email as well as to conduct a Facebook verification of your account. You, however, do not need to verify your phone number as this is optional.</p>



<p><strong>Nooklyn alternative</strong>, Roomi, also considers the security of its users a priority. As such, it ensures the contact information of every user is obtained and verified. But here is where Roomi is better: Roomi ensures your contact info (email and phone number) is verified without violating your privacy. This is done by using the GlobaliD service.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="id-verifications-for-potential-roommates">ID Verifications for potential roommates</h3>



<p>Again, using the GlobaliD, Roomi conducts verification of your government-issued ID and keeps that information safe. It also puts you in control of your identity and your data while preserving your privacy. By this, we mean that Roomi allows you to choose what information to retain or delete as the case may be. Once your ID is verified, you receive the verified badge which boosts your listing, and improves your chances of finding a suitable roommate.</p>



<p>For the <strong>Nooklyn app</strong>, once you’ve signed up for the service, the immediate next step to creating your account is verifying your ID.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="privacy-security-of-profiles">Privacy &amp; security of profiles</h3>



<p>To a large extent, <strong>Nooklyn</strong> keeps any personal identifying information away from prying eyes. Also, once you have identified a potential roommate, you’re allowed to use the secure in-app messaging service to reach out to until you’re comfortable sharing other personal information.</p>



<p>Likewise, Roomi goes the extra mile securing your information with GlobaliD. It also puts the power right in your hands, allowing you to delete or alter your information per the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Once you’ve identified someone who matches your preference, you can reach them on the app using the secure in-app messaging option. This prevents you from having to share any unnecessary private information with a potential roommate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="24-7-support-content-moderation">24/7 support &amp; content moderation</h3>



<p><strong>Nooklyn</strong> has quite a broad offering when it comes to services rendered. Thus, the support available on the <strong>Nooklyn app</strong> is addressed for all these different functions. Roomi does one better. Primary support is in the form of a detailed FAQ section with answers to virtually any question that may arise. Further support and content moderation are provided by an in-house content moderation team. This team watches out for red flags that may be indicative of a wrong motive – a tell-tale signal of scammers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="criminal-background-check">Criminal background check</h3>



<p><strong>Nooklyn</strong> does not conduct any criminal background check to determine if you’re not guilty of any pending crimes. Unlike <strong>Nooklyn</strong>, Roomi is thorough, conducting criminal background checks against known international and relevant local intelligence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-profiles-which-app-makes-it-easier-to-find-your-perfect-roommate">User Profiles: Which app makes it easier to find your perfect roommate?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:73%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/lJsxu4FJmeaOI" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/community-troy-barnes-spoilers-lJsxu4FJmeaOI"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Once your ID is verified, you can go ahead to create a profile for yourself. This profile contains only basic information, which is visible to others who have <strong>Nooklyn</strong>. The <strong>Nooklyn app</strong> has an impressive UX design but navigation isn&#8217;t all that easy. Yes, it allows you to set certain filters when searching for roommates, but this is nowhere near detailed enough, leaving you with a lot of work to do to find the roommates that best match your preference.</p>



<p>The Roomi app is everything the <strong>Nooklyn app</strong> is, and more. It was designed to guarantee an optimal user experience. One would be right to conclude that it was designed to ensure the user’s needs are effectively met. The filters are exhaustive, thus ensuring you can set filters that factor in all your preferences. The app then uses its roommate matching algorithm to set you up with a roommate, making it the easier <strong>roommate finder</strong> service of the two.</p>



<p>Do you require a senior roommate? Roomi has got you. Just set the age filter to reflect this preference. What about a non-binary or transgender roommate? Just set the gender accordingly. Or maybe you want a roommate of your sexual orientation? Just set the sexual orientation filter to reflect the same. Roomi has got it all, and so do you if you sign up.</p>

<p>Additionally, with Roomi, you&#8217;re guaranteed a dynamic and fulfilling user experience whether you&#8217;re using the web app or the Android/iOS platforms. It was designed to make roommate searches easier for you, even if you&#8217;re not all that tech-savvy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-roommate-finder-for-you">So, which is the best Roommate Finder for you?</h2>



<p>Undoubtedly, Roomi is the <strong>best way to find roommates</strong> between the two apps. Nooklyn has interesting features for a free <strong>roommate finder</strong> service. However, Roomi is above and beyond in terms of features. It isn’t just easy-to-use; it is safe, secure, guarantees your privacy, and ensures what you want in a roommate is what you get.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The search for a perfect roommate is exhausting and often tricky. What if you&#8217;re allergic to their dog? Do they wash their dishes or leave them in the sink? Are they loud when you need to be working? These questions among many others will pop up when you&#8217;re on the hunt to search for a roommate with whom you can split bills to save money. If you&#8217;re here reading this, chances are that you&#8217;re tired of browsing listings. <strong>In this guide, we&#8217;ll walk you through the powerful roommate finder, Roomi, and how the platform compares to Silvernest. Let&#8217;s get started!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are These Roommate Finder Apps Free or Paid?</h2>



<p>Generally speaking, most roommate finder platforms are free to download and browse. However, at some point, you&#8217;ll be asked to upgrade to a subscription plan. <strong>What sets Roomi apart from the like of Silvernest alternatives?</strong></p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p><strong>As a free member on Roomi, you can swipe or message 5 times a day in addition to posting 2 free listings! You can download the Roomi app for free on all Android and iOS devices.</strong></p>



<p>However, Silvernest requires its users to sign up and post listings starting at $29.99/month, which includes a 5% service fee to use their platform.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription is not only more flexible in terms of payment options, but also more cost-effective, with more features than Silvernest alternatives at $29.99/month. <strong>The cool part? You can choose to pay either monthly or weekly depending on your budget!</strong></p>



<p><strong>Why is the Roomi Gold Plan worth the price?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Access to unlimited messages with potential roomies. (On mobile, you also get unlimited swipes!)</li><li>A Fully Verified status upgrade gets you 5x more messages.</li><li>A ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings.</li><li>5 active listings to post all the empty rooms in your apartment.</li><li>Free bookings to save over $100 on safe money transfer between you and your new Roomi.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Monthly payments for Roomi Gold boil down to $0.97 per day &#8211; cheaper than your bus ticket!

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust">Security: Can These Apps Help Me Find Roommates I Can Trust?</h2>



<p>In an increasingly virtual world, safe roomies are few and far between, especially if you&#8217;re not browsing on powerful roommate finder platforms. Why are safe roomies important? First of all, you&#8217;re be sharing a living space with them. Secondly, no one wants a roomie that defaults on rent payments or brings in unauthorized guests. <strong>So, what safety measures do Roomi and Silvernest take to protect their users? Let&#8217;s find out.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="verification-of-roommate-contact-info">Verification of Roommate Contact Info</h3>



<p>From Instagram to Airbnb, blue ticks are what verify accounts as safe. Guess what? Roomi has them too! Adding a GlobaliD will give you verified status on Roomi&#8217;s website, and attract other verified users who want to room with someone similar!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="id-verifications-for-potential-roommates">ID Verifications for Potential Roommates</h3>



<p>When users sign up for Silvernest, they are verified by human verification specialists. But that&#8217;s all there is. However, this is where Roomi shines as the best roommate finder. On Roomi, users are expected to comply with safety protocols such as <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002273223-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-roomi" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">clear profile photographs</a> and filling in their bios with detailed information with what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="privacy-security-of-profile">Privacy &amp; Security of Profile</h3>



<p>Online identity thieves are aplenty. Therefore, it&#8217;s understandable if you are wary about sharing information online. <strong>Silvernest will share your profile with anyone if they have paid for an upgraded service.</strong></p>



<p>However, Roomi ensures your physical and cyber security through the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Users can see information such as your age, a photo of you, your preferred location, and your budget (if you&#8217;ve specified one). <strong>Furthermore, Roomi doesn&#8217;t share your exact address with other parties, only an approximate location.</strong></li><li><strong>You can also make changes or delete your data anytime under GDPR</strong>. Just write a quick email to Roomi&#8217;s support team and your information will be deleted from the database. Cool, right?</li></ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="criminal-background-checks">Criminal Background Checks</h3>



<p>Roomi is a wonderful platform to find roommates by going the extra mile in accepting requests for background checks, unlike Silvernest or other Silvernest alternatives. However, you don&#8217;t need to complete a background check to start browsing on Roomi!</p>



<p>On the other hand, there are no such services on offer by Silvernest, which falls short on this roommate finder comparison.</p>

Roomi is an inclusive, all-in-one roommate finder, so you can enter any criteria into your search.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You&#8217;ve put down the deposit for your new home, filled in all the paperwork, and now want a roommate to save some money. If you&#8217;re on the lookout for a roommate to split the bills with to save some cash, Roomi&#8217;s here! <strong>In this guide, we&#8217;ll walk you through the best roommate finder, Roomi, and how it compares to Renthop.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are these Roommate Finder Apps Free or Paid?</h2>



<p>Typically, a lot of roommate finder platforms are free to download and browse listings. On a free plan, you can access basic features like searching for potential roommates&#8217; profiles. However, you may have to pay in order to use some of the more advanced features on offer.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p><strong>Renthop offers three paid plans &#8211; Silver, Gold, and Platinum</strong>. The plans are available for $69, $149, and $199, respectively. You can post up to a maximum of five listings for free.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at pricing plans offered by the best Renthop alternative, Roomi. First off, you can download and use it for free, which is great because there are no fees to worry about! Your roommate search is hassle-free, with five swipes each day and two listings as a free member. <strong>If you&#8217;re looking to unlock premium features, subscribe to Roomi&#8217;s Gold plan!</strong></p>



<p><strong>Why should I get Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription Plan?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Unlimited messages (plus, on mobile, you also get unlimited swipes!)</li>



<li>A Fully Verified status upgrade which gets you 5x more messages!</li>



<li>A ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings.</li>



<li>5 active listings to post all the empty rooms in your apartment.</li>



<li>Free bookings to save over $100 on safe money transfer between you and your new Roomi!</li>
</ul>



<p>You can pay for Roomi Gold on a weekly or monthly basis. <strong>Monthly payments start at $29.99, which works out to $0.97 per day &#8211; cheaper than your morning cup of joe; and certainly more affordable than Renthop!</strong> For more information on Roomi&#8217;s pricing plans, head over to our page <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002257580-roomi-gold-subscriptions" class="broken_link">for more information</a> about our subscriptions.</p>

<p>Are you a student moving off-campus with no family or friends nearby? Are you new to the city? However you&#8217;re placed, <a href="https://roomiapp.com/">Roomi</a> helps you find roomies for your peace of mind and physical safety! Let&#8217;s compare Roomi with websites like Renthop to find out which roommate finder offers the best safety measures.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="verifies-roommate-contact-info">Verifies Roommate Contact Info</h3>



<p>You can sign up for Renthop&#8217;s services by authorizing the connection to either your Google or Facebook account. However, with Roomi, you don&#8217;t have to worry about your potential roommate(s) because the roommate finder collects contact information to validate their identity. Roomi uses <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002035258-what-is-globalid-" class="broken_link">GlobalID</a>, which is a digital platform that verifies users and their contact information while keeping their data safe and secure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="id-verification">ID Verification</h3>



<p>Are you asked to show your driver&#8217;s license at the supermarket or airport? Roomi has implemented similar security measures to protect its users. Roomi asks all members to upload a picture of their passport, driver&#8217;s license, or government-issued ID to verify their identity. This way, you can be sure that when you view other profiles on Roomi, they are safe and verified. On the other hand, Renthop&#8217;s users are only asked to link their social profiles for verification, making it a lot less secure than Roomi&#8217;s advanced measures.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="privacy-security-of-profiles">Privacy &amp; Security of Profiles</h3>



<p>Roomi offers private messaging features and makes sure your personal information is safe. Additionally, under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), you can request to have your data deleted after filling out a form! Just send an email to Roomi&#8217;s support team, and they will delete your information from our database. However, on Renthop, you&#8217;ll have to jump through some hoops to ensure your safety like filling in a privacy request form.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="24-7-support-content-moderation">24/7 Support &amp; Content Moderation</h3>



<p>One of Roomi&#8217;s most attractive features is its content moderation team. The team filters out phony listings and ensures authenticity. The thorough verification process of Roomi makes searching for roommates reliable and safe. This makes the best Renthop alternative a powerful roommate finder. Meanwhile, Renthop doesn&#8217;t offer the same services.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="criminal-background-check">Criminal Background Check</h3>



<p>If you need to do a background check, Roomi can help. The roommate finder searches through several international and local criminal databases. The Roomi Gold plan also gives all users a verified badge, which guarantees at least five times more visibility, which helps you find the perfect roommate without worrying! Renthop doesn&#8217;t have the same advanced security filters.</p>

<p>Both Renthop and the Renthop alternative Roomi allow you to browse roommates easily. However, with the powerful roommate finder Roomi, you can access more specific filters beyond location and price! Roomi has an advanced roommate matching algorithm with a comprehensive checklist to make sure that you end up with the perfect roommate, including senior roommates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-it-lgbtqia-friendly">Is it LGBTQIA+ Friendly?</h3>



<p>Absolutely! Roomi is an inclusive roommate finder platform that is focused on finding you the perfect roommate, whoever they may be!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While websites like Craigslist can help you find roommates, they come with financial risks and a lot of stress. Imagine having to pick one roommate from 1000 reaching out. Invariably, choosing a roommate will often end as guesswork or you may not get the best person possible. Alternatively, using a roommate finder like Roomi or Roomzoom is a better way to find safe roomies. Knowing fully well that no two apps are exactly the same, let&#8217;s find out which roommate finder is best for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pricing: Are these roommate finder apps free or paid?</h2>



<p>Living in any metro city is generally expensive. As such, having a budget for most endeavors, including a roommate search, is usually a wise choice. Especially if you&#8217;re new to the city. You don&#8217;t want to spend all you have without knowing what&#8217;s next. You also want to make sure you get the best value for your money. Thus, discovering a roommate finder within your budget is important. Also, it bears repeating that free doesn&#8217;t always mean good as many free platforms have been known to be havens for scammers and spammers. So, how do the Roomi and Roomzoom roommate finder services compare in terms of pricing? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>

	</div>
	


<p>Roomzoom is free to use for roommate search. All you have to do is signup, answer a series of questions about lifestyle and personality&#8230; and that&#8217;s all. The service delivers a ranked list of roommate matches based on your responses, making you do much of the legwork to find the perfect match.</p>



<p>Roomi is also free to use. As a free user, you can send up to 5 messages/swipes daily and can post or activate 2 listings. However, Roomi also recently launched the Roomi Gold subscription plan that significantly improves your chances of finding a safe roomie that matches your preferences perfectly. What you pay is dependent on your tier. You can be sure, as you&#8217;ll see below, that there is much to benefit from opting for a paid plan.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Security: Can these apps help me find roommates I can trust?</h2>



<p>If you have a roommate, you want to be sure that your life won&#8217;t be at risk. You want to know you have someone you can trust in case of an emergency. You want to know that they are really who they claim to be. It means that as important as it is to find roommates, finding a safe roomie is even more so. This is especially true when you&#8217;re just moving into the city and you don&#8217;t have trusted people around. You want to be sure that even before you meet up, your roommate&#8217;s identity has been verified. This way, you know you&#8217;ll have a safe roomie.</p>

<p>A surer way is to use a roommate finder that goes the extra mile to verify the identity of its users and conduct background checks when doing a roommate search. That way, you can be certain anyone you get matched with is at least who they say they are. So how does Roomzoom and Roomzoom alternative, Roomi, get this done?</p>



<p>While Roomzoom saves you a lot of time and energy in finding a roommate, the website encourages you to meet up in person before making a decision. That&#8217;sabout it. Roomi, on the other hand, shows more concern for your security. It completes a background check and identity verification on its users. This way, you can be sure that whoever you get matched with is really who they say they are, and not just playing to the gallery. This security concern is perhaps what makes Roomi the best way to find a roommate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Verification of roommate contact info</h3>



<p>Roomzoom verification is limited to addresses for those listing a residence. Contrarily, Roomi is more thorough with the verifications, allowing its users a chance to get their identities verified while keeping the information private. It utilizes GlobalID Verification. The GlobalID is a digital identity platform that verifies by using government-issued IDs and keeps the information secure without sharing details with others.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">ID verifications for potential roommates</h3>



<p>Roomzoom carries out no identity verification. Just sign up, fill out your details, answer a few questions, and boom! You&#8217;ll receive a list of roommates based on your preferences. There is nothing really like ID verification for potential roommates.</p>



<p>Roomi, on the other hand, allows for ID verifications. Imagine the confidence you&#8217;ll have knowing that your roommate is really who they claim they are. Roomi does this by verifying a government-issued ID against the profile to see if the information matches. To give you the needed push to get this done, users who complete the ID verification get a verification badge that increases their chances of finding the perfect roommate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Privacy &amp; security of profiles</h3>



<p>Privacy and data breach have become rampant these days. So it&#8217;s smart to apply caution when sharing personal information. With Roomzoom, the information you give them is displayed on your profile. Roomi goes the extra mile, securing your information with GlobaliD. It also puts the power right in your hands, allowing you to delete or alter your information at will. You can also reach out to potential roommates on the app using the secure in-app messaging option. This prevents you from having to share any unnecessary private information with a potential roommate. How amazing is that for a roommate finder!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">24/7 support &amp; content moderation</h3>



<p>Roomzoom has quite a small team. They keep an eye out for potential scammers and spammers. Usually, once identified, such accounts are usually removed. They also ask that users who find suspicious accounts report them. Roomzoom alternative, Roomi has an in-house content moderation team that provides support and also moderates content, identifying any bad listings and spam messages.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Criminal background check</h3>



<p>Should you require it, Roomi will carry out a criminal background check against several international and local criminal databases. Once done, the user gets a verified partners badge which guarantees you at least five times more visibility, increasing your chances of finding the perfect roommate. Roomzoom does not have any such feature and that can potentially expose you to dangerous prospects.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">User Profiles: Which app makes it easier to find your perfect roommate?</h2>



<p>Using all the information you provide, Roomzoom creates a user profile for you. This profile is visible to anyone with a Roomzoom account. Members can also vote for one another, thus improving their ranking and visibility.</p>



<p>Roomi was designed to make finding a roommate easy, safe, and quick. We all have our preferences. When conducting a roommate search, those preferences become a luxury. But it&#8217;s a luxury you can afford with Roomi. The app uses a roommate matching algorithm that employs preset filters to match you to a roommate. You can apply filters relating to anything, such as age, gender, interests, neighborhood, duration, move date, budget, and even house rules. What&#8217;s more? The app&#8217;s so easy to use that even if you&#8217;re not techy, you can find your way around.</p>

	</div>
	


<p>So, does that mean you can get a senior roommate? Yes. Just make sure to adjust your age filter accordingly during your roommate search. What if you want an LGBTQ+ friendly or a non-binary roommate? By all means, go ahead and select it in your filter, and the roommate matching algorithm will do the rest.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, which is the best roommate finder for you?</h2>



<p>Finding a roommate can be a daunting task, but roommate finders make it easier. Roomzoom may generate matches faster, but if you had to decide based on value, preferences, and security guarantees, Roomzoom alternative, Roomi, is the best website to find a roommate. With it, you have all you want and more. With over 50,000 roommates worldwide and world-class client service, you can rest assured you&#8217;re in good hands when you use Roomi for your roommate search.</p>

<p>Wondering how to go about your roommate search in Seattle, Washington? Believe us, it&#8217;s really not difficult to find yourself some roommates in Seattle. It&#8217;s quite literally just a search away on Roomi! Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about taking up your search for roommates in Seattle!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are some of the reasons people move to Seattle, Washington?</h2>



<p>There are so many great things about moving to and being able to find a roommate in Seattle. There&#8217;s an array of world-class schools, the job market&#8217;s super attractive, and the unique culture of the city is just undeniably a whole other experience. There are so many outdoor activities available here that everyone that actually moves to this gem in the Pacific Northwest gem ends up loving it, roommates or not!</p>

<p>To answer the question on many people&#8217;s minds: &#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t rain all the time.&#8221; Seattle gets less rain annually than Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Miami, and many other major metro areas. The natural beauty of Seattle is breathtaking too! It&#8217;s surrounded by both mountains and water on two sides – is one of the biggest draws for residents.</p>



<p>The scenery and proximity to nature, perhaps, contribute to Seattle&#8217;s inherent attitude: one of calm and patience. Locals are mocked for always allowing others to merge on the freeway. Still, that attitude extends to everyday life, where coffee shops harbor intellectual discussions, and nightlife is more about chilling with a beer at the bar than wild nights on the dance floor.</p>



<p>For many, living in Seattle has as much to do with what&#8217;s outside the city proper as what&#8217;s inside. Less than an hour from downtown, residents escape for the day or weekend to wineries, ski resorts, hiking trails, and sprawling parks. Seattleites bring that love of nature into the city proper as much as possible, enjoying Seattle&#8217;s parks and tree-lined streets while staying cozy in fleece jackets (practically the local uniform).</p>

<p>A single person estimated monthly costs are 1,163.46$ without rent — which is why it may be beneficial to find roommates in Seattle, after all. According to data from <a href="http://numbeo.com/">Numbeo</a>, a meal at a typical Seattle dining establishment costs about $30 per person, compared to the $25 national average. However, there are also plenty of open-air farmers&#8217; markets that run from spring through autumn here, where you may be able to find great deals on fresh produce.</p>



<p>While Seattle does have a light rail system, it only serves a limited portion of the city. Most Seattleites either own a car or use the public bus system. The city also has a large contingent of cyclists, but given the number of hills and the lousy winter weather, it takes a high level of commitment to rely on a bike year-round.</p>



<p>It isn’t all bad news for current and future Seattle residents, though. There’s one important commodity which is cheaper in this city than almost anywhere else in the country: electricity. This is due in large part to a number of major hydroelectric power plants throughout the state.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of opportunities out there to help you find a roommate through apps.

But outside of that, posters have a lot of freedom in how they write their ads. This leads to a lot of diversity in posting style, which can be a bit confusing and make room-to-room comparisons a trial. Unfortunately, it also has a reputation for being a haven for scammers, shady brokers, and other undesirables.</span></p>

A quick filter menu at the top lets you set things like minimum and maximum price, pop in the neighborhood, and off you go. If you want more filters, you can add them in this room finder app. The interface gives you a scrolling option of whatever fits your filters, or you can jump over to the map view and select things based on location. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it doesn’t let you find roommate in </span>this<span style="font-weight: 400;"> app, so you’re still stuck there.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two major drawbacks though. One, this app doesn’t help you find a roommate. Two, it’s built for more national and state level searches. The renter&#8217;s advice on the blog is quite good but very general. The local guides offer nice overviews of a city or neighborhood but don’t get into many specifics and don’t update often.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every apartment finder in NYC is a little bit different, and there is no shortage of websites that specialize in the New York City area. With so many options, it can be tough to figure out how to prioritize one over the other. Here is a list of qualities you should look for in the best apartment finder apps in NYC that specialize in serving the city!</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An NYC Apartment Finder Should Help With Roommates Too</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us can’t afford to live on our own in New York City. Mere mortals like us need a roommate to help with rent. So if you’re using an apartment finder in NYC, it really needs to help find roommates too. Otherwise, you’re putting a lot of effort into winning only half the battle. That’s like ordering a BLT and getting empty bread. Or worse, getting the meat without the bread . . . messy. So find the peanut butter to your jelly and get together with a great roommate while you&#8217;re searching for an awesome place to live.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Scrollable Map Feature: A must in NYC apartment finder</strong> app</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&nbsp;don’t really need a car in New York City. In fact, having a car in &#8216;The City That Never Sleeps&#8217; is more likely to rev up your stress than anything else. Parking is a full contact sport, sans helmets. Assuming you can find one close enough to where you want to be without passing out from dehydration before you trek there. </span></p>

<p>Your NYC apartment finder app should include public transportation, grocery stores, super cool bars and clubs. Parks, coffee shops, craft breweries. Nobody packs more diversity into a single city block than NYC. Nobody! Every neighborhood in The Big Apple has a different personality. So check out the local eats, music scene, and shops on the NYC apartment finder in detail.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cars are just another expense too. Not just car payments. Oil changes. Tune ups. The occasional trip to the body shop, courtesy of your friendly neighborhood scratch artist. So yeah, skip the car if you can. But not having your own wheels means knowing what’s available in your local area is super important.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t commit to an apartment, buy into a neighborhood.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Safe And Secure</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shady brokers and shifty landlords are like cockroaches. You can hear them scuttling around out there, but the second you turn on the lights, they vanish. You shouldn’t have to invest a bunch of your time making sure the person on the other end of the email is legit. Let the apartment finder app in NYC take care of that for you. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The site should have real, actual human beings digging through the listings and taking out the trash as a service to you. That way, by the time you get there, it’s pristine, safe, and secure.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Accessible Customer Support is basic to any apartment finder app</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should be able to talk to someone quickly and easily in case you have a problem. Some NYC apartment finders make you submit an email, and it can take days for them to respond, or longer. In New York City, a good apartment can get snatched up in a fraction of that time. Heck, even a bad one moves way faster than that. </span></p>

<p>Hence, c<span style="font-weight: 400;">ustomer service should be on hand when you need them. Or at the very least, able to get back to you within 24 hours. That way you’re not sweating it out wondering if that perfect place vanished while you were waiting for someone to get back to you.</span></p>

There’s practically enough paperwork to build an entire apartment out of recycled forms. There’s a lot of extra steps, and you need a guarantor who makes at least forty times the monthly rent. Yup. That’s right. Forty. So make sure that whichever apartment finder app you use, also gives rental advice and tips for living in New York.</span></p>

<p>When you set out to find roommates, every aspect of your life hinges on the results of your decision. Sleep. Health. Sanity. Work. It’s all up for grabs. Will you find the perfect roommate who compliments your lifestyle, or will you get trapped in a nightmare situation with a certified crazy person who will slowly drive you over the edge? Here is some advice on how to find roommates in NYC:</p>
<h2><strong>To start finding Roommates in NYC, start with number one</strong></h2>
<p>The fastest way to find the wrong roommate is to have an unrealistic assessment of yourself. If you don’t have a clear understanding of <a href="https://www.success.com/6-steps-to-discover-your-true-self/">who you are</a>, how you play nice with others, and where your communal living skills could use some work, you’ll never be able to find that complementary puzzle piece of a person.</p>
<p>Identifying how good we are with people is the easy part for most of us. Yeah, we’re awesome. You want us to tell you how awesome we are? We can totally do that in glorious detail. Weaknesses, however, tend to be a little tougher to pin down. Do you do all of your chores? On time? Without fail? Be honest. Do you ever make loud noises, like letting the door slam behind you when you come home late, or making <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sharing-a-kitchen-a-guide-to-peacefully-share-a-kitchen-with-roommates/">vanilla-chai protein shakes</a> at the crack of dawn? Habitual actions are easy for us to tune out ourselves, but can be disruptive for those around us, and we don’t even notice.</p>

</div>
<h2><strong>Work on yourself&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Be extra-critical of anything you do routinely and ask yourself how it affects other people. Or better yet, just ask them. If it’s been irritating them this whole time, they’ll be all too happy to tell you about it. Also in glorious detail.</p>
<p>Even if you’re one of those rare people who can launch into a clear, grounded <a href="https://lifeskillsthatmatter.com/personal-self-assessment/">self-assessment</a>, it’s still a good idea to ask some of your existing or previous roommates for a no-holds-barred critique. If you don’t have a history of roommates yet, ask your family. You might be surprised to learn that you always trample up and down stairs so loudly you sound like you’re storming a castle. Once you gather all the juicy data, use it to build an accurate description of your lifestyle choices, then add whether you have pets, your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-save-money-while-living-in-midtown-east-nyc/">budget</a>, and other roommate basics. Get it all typed into your computer or smartphone and have it visible when you are searching.</p>
<h2><strong>Use Roomi As Your Searching Tool when finding roommates in NYC</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://roomiapp.com/">Roomiapp.com</a>​ can help you find more than just rooms, it has a big focus on getting to know roommates. Apartment listings have more than just square feet and utilities. Roommate lifestyle choices are clearly labeled. So you can tell quickly which piece of plastic the current residents wear out first, their credit cards or their library cards. You can also search by neighborhood, which is a cool feature if being close to work is a requirement for you. Midtown, Upper East Side, Downtown Brooklyn, it’s all there, and you can compare average rent at a glance. Budget is a restriction for most of us, especially in NYC where the only thing higher than the</p>

<p>skyscrapers is the rent. Having all the average rents for all the neighborhoods right in front of you like that is a real time saver.</p>
