<p>Sharing the kitchen has always brought challenges and, in worse cases, cold wars! But if you also, like so many of us since last year, have started to cook meals for yourself, then you’ve suddenly had a lot more to learn about kitchen maintenance.</p>



<p>It’s hard enough doing this alone, and it can go either way when the kitchen is shared – <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/9-space-saving-hacks-for-a-small-kitchen-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially if it’s a small one</a>! It can be the most annoyed you’ll ever be with your roommate, or you’ll work with so harmoniously together that it’s no sweat.</p>



<p>Here are some kitchen etiquette and tips to share a kitchen with roommates peacefully.</p>



<p><strong>Click here to read about <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/groceries-and-roommates-how-to-budget-better-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Groceries and Roommates: How to Budget Better!</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clean up your own messes</h2>



<p>Wash your own dishes as soon as you’re done cooking and eating with them (yes, immediately, if possible!). These dishes include cutting boards, knives, and everything else you’ve used. Wipe the counter and the stove/oven if you see mess. Basically, leave the kitchen the way you’d like others to leave for you! Sharing your kitchen doesn’t mean sharing your mess.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If all of your schedules are <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too busy to afford time</a> for cleaning, hire help to clean your kitchen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Call for kitchen meetings – communicate</h2>



<p>Talk with your roommates about kitchen etiquette and understand each other’s habits. Things will only get better with more communication and there’ll be no space for petty grudges.</p>



<p>For a peaceful kitchen in the house, talk about your expectations and take time to get used to one another’s routines. You’ll also understand what everyone uses their kitchenware for, what groceries belongs to whom, and where to draw the boundaries.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create a cooking schedule</h2>



<p>Too many people trying to use the kitchen at the same time will end in frustration and a dirty kitchen that no one wants to take the blame for. Plan a rotating cooking schedule so there aren’t too many cooks in the kitchen. If Eric leaves home earliest, he should use the kitchen first, and if Salma doesn’t mind a late dinner, she gets to have the kitchen last for the day.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Give your roommates a heads-up if you’re planning a big cooking project that takes time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set some kitchen rules</h2>



<p>A shared kitchen inevitably has some shared items and utilities. Set rules that everyone must follow; they very from “return the knives to their tray” to “don’t use the microwave for long hours on busy work-from-home weekday” to “replace the dish soap when it’s over, for heaven’s sake!” And does everyone get to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/hacks-on-growing-your-own-kitchen-garden-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the kitchen garden</a>?</p>

<p>Two great additions to help you out: a white board with reminders and a fine jar that collects penalties from rule breakers. But make it fun! <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/6-shared-apps-for-roommates-to-maintain-peace-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Try using some apps to help you out too</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clean together or make a plan</h2>



<p>Even when everyone has been cleaning after themselves the kitchen is the one place that just doesn’t stay clean. Decide on a day and time once a week or two weeks, when everyone is free, to join and quickly get the chore over with. Share the chore – many hands do make light work!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Respect others’ kitchen items and time</h2>



<p>It’s very tempting to borrow your roommate’s nonstick pan to make your pancakes, or his clean cutlery. But does he know about it? As long-term roommates, we hope you are comfortable letting each other use your belongings in the kitchen – with permission, of course. Trust one another to be the adult you’d like to see them as. Well, at least to give them a chance!</p>



<p>But reaching for someone else’s groceries is a big no! Unless you have already talked about it and have an understanding of replacing them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="288" data-attachment-id="8536" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sharing-a-kitchen-a-guide-to-peacefully-share-a-kitchen-with-roommates/attachment/what-the-hell-is-happenning/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-hell-is-happenning-.gif?fit=480%2C288&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="480,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="what-the-hell-is-happenning-" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-hell-is-happenning-.gif?fit=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-hell-is-happenning-.gif?fit=480%2C288&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-hell-is-happenning-.gif?resize=480%2C288&#038;ssl=1" alt="a man standing in a kitchen, looking disappointed " class="wp-image-8536"/></figure>



<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Explicitly discuss what items in the kitchen are shared. For example, everyone uses the towels and the soap, but not that expensive bottle of oyster sauce. Also talk about big purchases and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-must-haves-shared-kitchen-recommended-nutritionists/">how everyone is going to share them</a>.</p>

<p>We all have days when we go into the kitchen to cook and spend hours there because things didn&#8217;t go the way we anticipated. That&#8217;s also partially the reason you dislike cooking. Don&#8217;t worry we&#8217;ve got you covered- you can bid goodbye to the days of kitchen distress as we have a list of ingenious kitchen hacks that will make you fall in love with cooking all over again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Who are you rooting for?</h2>



<p>Well, we are rooting for freezers as they are a great way to store fresh ginger esp. when you&#8217;re done grating it. Just freeze the leftover root in a plastic container to avoid stray shriveled ginger across your fridge.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Avoid cling wrap disasters!</h2>



<p>Have you had enough of annoying wrangling plastic wrap? Store the roll in the fridge as chilling the wrap reduces the stickiness. I&#8217;ve literally found myself tangled up in cling foil on many occasions. But thanks to this useful kitchen hack I am sorted for life! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Make foamy milk without a frother at home! (#1 on ingenious kitchen hacks you didn&#8217;t think you needed, but do now)</h2>



<p>So what you don&#8217;t own a fancy-schmancy espresso machine with an attached milk steamer? Honestly, all you need is a small glass jar with a lid. Fill the jar halfway with milk and shake it off Taylor Swift style until the jar contents have doubled in size. Now pop in the microwave for 30 seconds to enjoy the frothy goodness. You&#8217;re welcome!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Save your brown sugar!</h2>



<p>Ugh, the worst: You go to make cookies, only to find your brown sugar has hardened beyond revival.</p>



<p>Use this useful kitchen hack to help your brown sugar stay soft &#8211; add orange peel or a slice of apple along with the sugar into an airtight container.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. This one will drive you nuts!</h2>



<p>Nuts are freezer-friendly, and you could freeze shelled nuts to preserve their natural oils and make them last longer. This is one of those kitchen hacks that will save your nuts throughout the year. Ok, I don&#8217;t think that came out right!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Goodbye ice cream freezer burns</h2>



<p>This is clearly the most annoying thing that could happen to anyone &#8211; you want to eat your ice cream, but the ice cream doesn&#8217;t want you to eat it. You can keep ice cream ready to eat by placing a piece of wax paper over it before putting it back in the freezer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Hacks to save time &#8211; Make herbs last longer</h2>



<p>What&#8217;s worse than buying fresh herbs in bulk &#8211; to see them wilt and die the very next day. Store herbs like parsley &amp; cilantro properly with this cool storage tip! Trim the stems and place the herbs in a small glass of water. Cover the herbs with a plastic/grocery bag and secure by tying the plastic in a knot. Store in the fridge or on the counter for up to two weeks!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Hull strawberries without squishing them</h2>



<p>Place a drinking straw into the bottom of the berry, then push it through all the way till you remove the stem and leaves. Handy and super easy!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. When life gives you lemons</h2>



<p>Squeeze the maximum juice out of it by using this useful kitchen hack. To get the most juice out of a lemon, refrigerate, then microwave it for 15 to 20 seconds. Yep, this is definitely one of those hacks that will save you time and energy. Because nobody likes fussing over a lemon that doesn&#8217;t squeeze well!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Who&#8217;s a firefighter?</h2>



<p>You are! Accidents happen in the kitchen all the time. So you were doing a fancy flip and now your oil-soaked stir fry is on fire &#8211;&nbsp;<em>it happens!</em>&nbsp;Before you abandon the pan to save your life or call your roomi for help, try this hack. By no means add water to a fire caused by oil &#8211; it will only make it worse. Instead, sprinkle baking soda onto a small grease or electrical fire to extinguish the flames. When heated, baking soda releases carbon dioxide, which helps to kill the fire.</p>
