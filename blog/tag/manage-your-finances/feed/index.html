<p>Handling finances is one of those aspects of adult life that no one really formally teaches you about. It’s right up there with other adulting mysteries like filing your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/guide-to-filing-taxes-as-a-college-student/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taxes </a>and deciding what to eat for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/lazy-roomi-cooking-9-recipes-for-slow-lazy-days-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner</a>. But nevertheless, it’s an important skill to have if you want to set yourself up for a good life. So, to help you get better at managing your finances, we’re going to deal with a pretty serious-sounding topic: investment. We know, we know, investing sounds like something only fancy Wall Street executives do in their high-end (pant) suits. But if you’re an adult with a source of income, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t invest. Moreover, if you’re at a stage where you want to find better ways of managing your personal finances, looking into investments is the way to go! So, here we go, let’s learn a little about investing!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-in-handling-your-finances-what-are-the-basic-types-of-investments">Lessons in handling your finances: What are the basic types of investments?</h2>



<p>If you’re new to the world of investing, everything probably feels overwhelming right now. And that’s <em>okay</em>. It will take a while before you can familiarize yourself with the different types of investment options available to you and if they’re a good fit or not. So, rather than throwing a bunch of jargon at you, we thought we’d make things a bit easier for you. Which is to say that today we’ll be looking at three basic types of investments that are best suited for beginners handling their finances. Maybe you’ve heard some of these before, maybe you haven’t. But by the end of this, you’ll definitely get a better understanding of the different options available to you and how each of these will help you in managing your personal finances! So, let’s start with the most basic one.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Financial Planning Basics: The 6 Golden Rules To Save Money</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-easiest-way-to-start-handling-your-finances-retirement-account">The easiest way to start handling your finances: retirement account</h2>



<p>You probably weren’t expecting 401(k) to show up on this list, but here we are. Investing through your employer is a great, low-risk way of handling your finances. For most employees, a retirement account is the first investment they make. Especially, if your employer matches a percentage of your contribution towards your fund. What’s more is that there isn’t generally, a minimum amount you need to contribute towards the fund. Pay whatever amount you&#8217;re comfortable with. Though it is recommended that you contribute at least enough to be able to claim the full employer match. So, if you’ve just started managing your personal finances, definitely look into retirement funds. If you already have one, great! If you don’t, reach out to HR to find out what your options are!</p>



<p><strong>Roomi tip:</strong> If your employer doesn’t offer a retirement plan (or if you’re self-employed), don’t worry! You can open an IRA account on your own. Go <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here </a>to learn more! For those interested in diversifying their retirement savings, considering different asset classes can be beneficial. One such option is <a href="https://www.pimbex.com/article/how-do-i-open-a-gold-and-silver-ira/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding gold and silver to your IRA</a>, which provides a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Learn more about the process and advantages of setting up a gold and silver IRA to secure your financial future.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fixed-income-investments">Fixed-Income Investments</h2>



<p>As the name might suggest, this is one of the safest investments for beginners out there. A fixed-income investment is generally known as a bond. These bonds allow the investor to get a fixed-rate payment over a specific period of time. Bonds are offered by both companies and governments and is one of the largest markets out there. You can actually look at bonds as a loan that you are giving out to the government or a company. And you get a specific amount of interest back, called the coupon rate, in exchange for this loan. This interest is generally paid once or twice a year till the whole amount is paid off i.e. the bond reaches its maturity. </p>



<p>If you’re planning on holding onto the bond till it reaches maturity, you don’t have to worry about your return on investment. You’ll be fine. But if you want to further buy or sell your bond before its maturity, then the market fluctuations will affect you. Just remember this simple rule and you’ll be fine- when interest rates increase, the price of the bond decreases, and as interest rates decrease, the price of the bond increases. If you’re looking for a low-risk way of managing your personal finances, we definitely recommend fixed-income investments! So, if you&#8217;re just starting to think about handling your finances better, this could be your best bet!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-equity-investments-or-stocks">Equity investments or Stocks</h2>



<p>This is probably what you were looking for when you clicked on this blog. Everyone’s mind always goes to stocks when they hear the word “investment”. Which is just as well because equity investment is great for beginners. If you’re not quite sure what they are, don’t worry, you’ve just started managing your personal finances! In a nutshell, equity investments is the buying and selling of stocks of publicly traded companies. Which means, public trade companies sell shares to investors as a way to raise capital to expand their business. In return, the investors get equity interest in the company. Some companies also offer dividends to their investors for every stock they own, which adds extra value to <a href="https://www.gainify.io/top-investors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top investors portfolio</a>, making them happy. If you’d like to research and compare the companies that pay dividends, go to <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dividend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Dividend.com</a>!</p>

				</div>

	</div>
	


<p>Of course, if you want to invest in stocks, you need to have an adequate understanding of the stock market. After all, if the company you’re invested in is doing well, only then can you make a profit from the stocks you own. If you’re thinking of equity investments, we recommend doing some market research beforehand. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo Finance</a> and <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morningstar</a> can be really helpful to better understand how the market is behaving and what companies you should invest in! The more you understand the stock market, the better you’ll get at equity investment. Trust us, before you know it, you’ll be a master of handling your finances!</p>

<p>Being on a first-name basis with your financial aid department will give you the opportunity to explore if you are eligible for financial aid or additional grants and scholarships. Don’t be afraid to ask for help!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Utilize your meal plan to save money in college</h2>



<p>It’s free food! If you’re paying for a <a href="https://www.everydollar.com/blog/create-a-meal-plan" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">meal plan</a>, make sure you use it. Go to the dining hall with friends and research other food spots on campus that are covered by your meal plan. Dining halls offer a variety of food options and are much more convenient than going to the grocery store weekly. Be smart, save money in college by going to the dining hall!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Be mindful of your spending on food and drinks</h2>



<p>Overspending can be tempting when friends regularly want to order pizza or go out to the bar (only if you’re 21, of course!) When making a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/10-ways-save-money-food-shopping" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">weekly spending schedule</a>, make sure a portion of that spending is for food and drinks. If you go out to the bar with friends, make sure that you have a limited amount of cash on hand instead of a credit card. </p>



<p>This will really help you save money in college, so you are not tempted to splash out. Don&#8217;t worry if you’ve spent too much money one week, suggest a movie night in with friends instead of going out!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Make a grocery list</h2>



<p>If you like to keep snacks in your room, make a list before going to the grocery store. Be sure to avoid going to the grocery store when you’re hungry; this will make you want to buy everything in sight! Buy off-brand items and items that come in bulk. They’re usually cheaper and will effectively save you money in college.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/8-secrets-to-spending-less-while-grocery-shopping-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Make a limit for the amount</a> that you want to spend at the store and only buy the necessities. Plan out the snacks that you want to have before making a trip to the grocery store. Try vegetables and hummus as a snack &#8211; it’s healthy <em>and</em> affordable!</p>

Try exploring <a href="https://www.scholarships.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Scholarships.com</a> or <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/scholarships" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Studentaid.gov</a> in order to find out scholarships that you are eligible for.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Earning, saving, and spending money are pretty much universal concepts that everyone gets stressed about. Learning to manage your finances is a learning curve for many of us. Most of us associate finance management with anxiety, thinking of it like a recurring dream that haunts us when it&#8217;s time to pay the rent and bills. Sometimes stress-free accounts are what we need to liberate ourselves.</p>



<p>Money problems are also one of the main reasons people feel stuck in jobs they don&#8217;t love. Not being able to relate to the &#8216;do what you love&#8217; quotes, we soon start to realize that &#8216;early to bed, early to rise&#8217; might not guarantee health or wealth if we don&#8217;t use time and money wisely.</p>



<p>All of these factors leave us feeling like we&#8217;re in a somewhat bittersweet relationship with money. A love-hate relationship is way too common. We chase the money, but also fear it. We continuously work towards it, but we also wish we didn&#8217;t have to.</p>



<p>Although we can&#8217;t change our finances overnight, we can try changing our perspective to help us feel better about money.</p>

<p>Here are our top tips for managing finances better and viewing money in a different, more positive light (no matter how much you make).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Manage your finances the smart way: Tailor your lifestyle to suit your income</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pound ought and six, result misery.&#8221; &#8211; Charles Dickens</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The number 1 rule of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basic financial planning</a>: For instance, work with what you currently make, prioritizing peace of mind and happiness over luxury.  To manage your finances better doesn&#8217;t mean settling for less and not working towards the financial future you want. But if you are content every step of the way, money might not have so much control over your life.<a href=""></a></p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Keep money from slipping out of your hands</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Many people take no care of their money till they come nearly to the end of it, and others do just the same with their time.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Time and money are deemed similar in the way we use and misuse them. As with managing time, if you manage money well, you will discover you have more than you thought you did.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Simple tip to manage your finances: Less is more if you want it to be</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor.&#8221;</em></p><cite><em>&#8211; Seneca</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>If you can afford rent and food easily, try to celebrate that more often. However, if you keep dreaming about a more luxurious life, you might affect the <em>happiness</em> you can afford right now.</p>



<p> Be ambitious instead. Instead of dreaming of a better future, try to actually work towards it. Be patient and stress-free accounts will bless you!</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Money does not reflect who you are</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;It’s good to have money and the things that money can buy, but it’s good, too, to check up once in a while and make sure that you haven’t lost the things that money can’t buy.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>&#8211; George Lorimer</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The fact of life is that money comes and goes. What stays is who you are. But in both cases, you need to work towards it constantly to manage your finances. So while you work on your finance management skills to attain the financial future you wish to have, make sure you also work on who you are and who you want to become. </p>



<p>If you really suck at the money bit, remember that stress-free accounts are real. Help is just around the corner!</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don&#8217;t let money rob you of your joy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Let him who would enjoy a good future waste none of his present.&#8221;</em></p><cite><em>&#8211; Roger Babson</em></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The truth is, however much you spend your time stressing over how to manage your finances, stress alone cannot change your circumstances. So while it&#8217;s important to make a feasible plan in order to acquire and manage your finances, overthinking it will just ruin your present.</p>



<p>We might all be in different boats, but we&#8217;re struggling to sail in the same mighty, unpredictable ocean. So hold on tight to the boat of good finance management, and let your worries drift away!</p>
