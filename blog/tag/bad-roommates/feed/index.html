<p>Adjusting to a roommate&nbsp;can be difficult enough, but when you’re saddled with a lazy roommate, coming back home can seem like a nightmare. As if work stress wasn’t enough, now you have to find time to complete your roommate’s chores as well.</p>



<p>While you may wish to avoid confrontation, in some cases, it&#8217;s unavoidable. So, what would be the best way to ask your roommate to start cleaning up after themselves?</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Looking for a roommate? Here are some qualities to look for!</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Communicate your distress</h3>



<p>When living with a messy roommate, it&#8217;s easy to assume they’re just lazy. However, it&#8217;s best to give them a chance to explain themselves and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/got-messy-roommate-here-s-how-confront-them-528808" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">have a conversation about it</a>. When living with another person, communication is key. There may be several reasons why your roommate can&#8217;t clean up after themselves; perhaps, they just lost their job or dealing with a difficult work situation, or it’s just how they are.</p>



<p>The best way of dealing with a messy roommate is to communicate your distress. Instead of hurling accusations at them, try to frame the problem as something that you need to tackle together. Pointing out your roommate’s flaws may be tempting, but it will only make them defensive and unwilling to listen to your suggestions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pick your battles</h3>



<p>Having honest conversations is important, but it&#8217;s just as crucial to know when to pick your battles. Arguing over every dirty dish, or crumb on the floor isn&#8217;t going to be productive. Cribbing over minor issues will probably lead to your roommate not wanting to listen to you, even when things are their fault.</p>



<p>If your roommate’s laziness is affecting common living spaces, that’s when you should try to convey your unhappiness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Think of your apartment in zones</h3>



<p>When dealing with a messy roommate, you need to accept that your home won&#8217;t be as neat and perfect as you want it to be. If you want everything to be your way, you’re likely to be disappointed. The best way to approach living with a lazy roommate is to think of your apartment in three zones: your space, your roommate’s space, and common spaces.</p>



<p>You have complete control over your space, such as your bedroom, and can keep it as tidy as you like. Similarly, your roommate has the right to keep their roommate the way they like it, although it may not be up to your standards.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Create a chore list or chart</h3>



<p>Although you may assume that your roommate understands their chores without needing to verbalize them, you may be wrong. Creating a chore list or chart helps keep track of what you both need to get done. It also helps that you have a visual reminder of the tasks that you need to do around the house to avoid forgetting or leaving it for the next day.</p>

<p>Sit down with your roommate and try to split the chores according to what you like and what they like. For example, you can wash the dishes then your roommate will wipe them and put them back on the shelf. As much as possible, try to divide chores evenly; you don’t want to get stuck doing all the work yourself!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Try cleaning and organizing together</h3>



<p>If all else fails, why not suggest cleaning and organizing together? Perhaps your roommate prefers group activities or could do with some tips on how to organize themselves better. Cleaning together can be a great way to spend time with your roommates and bond with them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Lead by example</h3>



<p>If you see that your roommate tends to leave a mess in the apartment, try leading by example. Clean up after yourself when eating or after using the kitchen or living room, show your roommate what should be done when it comes to cleaning. This way, your roommate can see how you clean and maybe take it as a sign that they should start cleaning too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Get the help of professional cleaners</h3>

You have to consider that there are extreme cases where your roommate just doesn&#8217;t know how to clean up after themselves, or maybe they&#8217;re going through a hard time that makes it difficult for them to clean. In this case, moving out is the best option, although it isn&#8217;t the easiest, it would be better for you to just leave the apartment and find a better place or roommate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dealing with loud roommates at night</h2>



<p>If you have a noisy roommate who is keeping you up at night, you should first try to take matters into your own hands. Here are some of the ways you can cut the noise and sleep better with loud roommates at night.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Earbuds or Headphones</h3>

<p>If your noisy roommates are hampering your sleep, consider investing in a pair of foam earbuds. They are a cheap and easy way to cancel out the noise and sleep better if you have loud roommates. If the roommate noise is beyond the powers of earbuds, you could use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=sony+710n&amp;qid=1622370845&amp;sr=8-4" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">noise-canceling headphones</a> instead. These are much more effective when it comes to cutting out the noise and letting you sleep better. If you are the type who listens to music while heading to bed, that may be a great way to unwind and cut the noise of your loud roommates at night.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Soundproof your room:</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If the earbuds or headphones aren&#8217;t helping, you may want to consider soundproofing your room. While noise-proof panels can be expensive, you can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pack-Acoustic-Panels-Inches-Soundproof/dp/B08QJFRK5L/ref=sr_1_4_sspa?dchild=1&amp;keywords=soundproof+panel&amp;qid=1622370887&amp;sr=8-4-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQzFaSE5JTTBOSjJZJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzcwNTYyNUFWRlg1VjFOR0JNJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyNzIxMTAzVkpaNENPWExSNVc1JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheaper options online</a> to line your door or walls. These dampen the noise of your loud roommates at night and should let you sleep in peace. Even lining the gap in your door with some sound-proof foam can help cut the noise spilling into your room from your noisy roommate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. White noise machine:</h3>

<p>If you still can&#8217;t get your quality shut-eye time, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magicteam-Machine-Looping-Soothing-Function/dp/B07RWRJ4XW/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;keywords=white+noise+machine&amp;qid=1622370930&amp;sr=8-7">white noise machine</a> may be a good purchase. This machine emits white noise, that will drown the noise and help you deal with a noisy roommate. If you don&#8217;t want to purchase a white noise machine, you could simply play some white noise from your phone or speakers instead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communicating your problems</h2>



<p>If you weren&#8217;t able to tackle the issue yourself or your noisy roommate persists in their ways, it may be time to have a talk. You should make your problems clear and out them in a way that does not seem aggressive or rude. Loud roommates can be a pain to tolerate and maybe talking to them is the only option left.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Tell them how you feel:</h3>



<p>Let your noisy roommate know that their noise is causing you trouble sleeping and that you have tried to deal with it yourself. A considerate roommate will understand your issue and be willing to make changes for you. Make them realize that their noise seeps into your room and that you don&#8217;t mind as long as this does not happen.</p>

	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Be polite and calm</h3>



<p>Be sure to stay calm and polite while explaining your concerns to your loud roommates. Do not make them feel like you are attacking them or their lifestyle and assure them that you just want some quiet at night. Tell them that you have tried to deal with it yourself and failed, hence are letting them know about your issues.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Make a noise complaint:</h3>



<p>If your noisy roommates refuse to be considerate after your try everything to deal with the problem, you may need to make a complaint. Talk to your building manager or dorm warden to let them know the problem you are facing. Leave it in their hands to take the issue further and deal with it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set rules</h2>



<p>Once the matter is finally settled, have a chat with your noisy roommates to work out rules and timings regarding noise. This is the best way to make sure that you have a mutual understanding and that the issues are solved. Framing a simple set of rules for your dorm or apartment can make life easier for everyone and help maintain peace with your noisy roommates. Make sure you avoid conflict and try to make them understand and empathize with your problem.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a narcissist?</h2>



<p>First off, you must understand <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">narcissistic personality disorder</a>. (NPD) It is a legitimate mental health condition that requires diagnosis by a mental health professional. The term narcissist is widely used interchangeably with NPD and this is a misunderstanding. While there are certain hallmark characteristics of NPD, having them does not necessarily mean you have the condition. A person can exhibit some characteristics of NPD and not actually suffer from it. However, if their narcissism is a strong pattern of behavior, they may be diagnosed with NPD. The first analysis you need to make is if your roommate is suffering from NPD or if they show have narcissistic tendencies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do I identify a narcissist?</h2>

<li>Unable to handle criticism and lash out if they feel slighted criticized.</li>



<li>Need constant praise.</li>



<li>They are willing to take advantage of others to get what they want.</li>



<li>They expect to be treated as superior or leader.</li>



<li>Have no remorse for hurting others.</li>



<li>Blame others for their own bad behavior or mistakes.</li>
</ul>

Hence, it is important that you take steps to deal with their behavior. Here is how you can try to make living with a narcissist roommate a little easier.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Accept who they are</h3>



<p>When they want to, those with narcissistic personalities are great at charming people. You might find yourself drawn to your narcissist roommate and their show of grandiose. These are also particularly popular in work settings or among their colleagues. When it comes to narcissists, they seem to draw all the attention towards themselves. Do not let all of this carry you away or make you react to them. Understand that these tendencies are just the way they are and, are common for people like them. Do not take their actions or words personally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do not try to change them</h3>



<p>The first step in dealing with your narcissist roommate is simply accepting that you cannot change them. Do not expect them to change, or you will just end up disappointed and frustrated. No matter how rationally you try to explain things, they are unlikely to hear you. Arguing with a narcissist may escalate the situation and trigger their inability to handle criticism. You need to understand that there is nothing that you can do to change a narcissist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do not feed their behavior</h3>



<p>Now that you have understood the tendencies of a narcissist, do not fall prey to them. They can make you feel pressured to push aside your own needs to keep them satisfied. They can be extremely demanding of your attention, praise, and obedience. However, it is essential you show them that they cannot bully you into submission. If you think there will be a break in their attention-seeking behavior, it doesn&#8217;t come. Do not humor a narcissist&#8217;s false reality and delusions. No matter how much you try to adjust your life to suit their needs, it is never enough.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Know yourself!</h3>



<p>Your narcissist roommate does not live in reality. Hence, their views of themselves and other people are wildly delusional. Remember this when a narcissist tries to manipulate, gaslight, or bully you. Don’t let their shame and blame strategy and manipulation undermine your self-esteem. The best defense against the insults and projections of the narcissist is your self-esteem. When you know yourself well, you are able to reject any unfair criticisms leveled against you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Have &#8216;the talk&#8217;</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve gone over the situation and made your assessment, it is time for you to sit them down. Let them know honestly but in a sensitive and friendly way. Put your foot down and don&#8217;t budge if they are being unreasonable. Avoid confronting them in a public space or in front of a large group of people as this can trigger them. They may react aggressively and fight back to save face. Hence, be ready to back off if you feel the situation could escalate. All the best!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let them go</h3>



<p>Maybe you have tried your best to accept who they are and deal with them. However, they still make living absolutely unbearable. This doesn&#8217;t need to be the case. It may be time to cut off your narcissist roommate. There are many fish (potential roommates) in the sea (city.) If they don&#8217;t value you, it could be time to search for a new roommate. Lucky for you, you&#8217;re already in the right place!</p>



<p>Roomi can help you find roommates and find one who is the right living partner for you. Better luck this time. Choose well!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Assessing the situation</h2>



<p>Before we get around to creating a plan of action, we need to assess the situation. Get to know the problem better and find out what the cause is. Sometimes there is so much more to a situation and person than you think. Here are some questions to ask yourself before you start looking for solutions.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your roommate doing alright?</h3>



<p>This past year or so has been extremely stressful and everyone&#8217;s mental health has taken a toll. It can be understandable if your roommate has been extremely cranky. Is your roommate doing okay? They may under immense pressure from their job or college or be overloaded with assignments. Your roommate maybe just going through a rough patch and keeping it all to themselves.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your roommate mentally unwell?</h3>



<p>Coming off the previous point, your roommate may be suffering from mental issues. You may not understand or know what is going in their personal lives. Thus, you only see them being difficult with you. While you are probably not a mental health expert, there may be signs. Are they having difficulties with people, their work, or their family?

<p>No, we aren&#8217;t gaslighting you or putting the blame on you, friend. We&#8217;d never. Your controlling roommate should never behave with you like that anyway. However, a little self-reflection may be in order. Is there something that you have done to see this side of them? Is there a time that you may have been rude or unkind to justify this kind of treatment? Or are you skipping your chores or being exceptionally messy?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are they just jealous?</h3>



<p>Now, we understand that you&#8217;re quite a cool kid and your friends love you. While you may have previously expected that your roommate will too, it is possible they&#8217;re jealous. After all, not everyone can handle all the awesomeness hon.</p>



<p>There could be some reason why your controlling roommate is jealous of you. This may just be their way of expressing it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding a solution</h2>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve found the root of the problem, it&#8217;s time to resolve this, once and for all. You want to be careful and sensitive while dealing with your roommate. Make sure you don&#8217;t send them into a flying rage. However, if you read on, we&#8217;re pretty sure you won&#8217;t.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-do-i-resolve-a-conflict-with-my-college-roommate/">Related: </a><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-do-i-resolve-a-conflict-with-my-college-roommate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Do I Resolve A Conflict with my College Roommate?</a></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You have to deal with it</h3>



<p>Now, not all of us are great at confrontation. The introverts and socially awkward kids among us understand the pressure of something like this. However, you can&#8217;t always keep walking on eggshells around your own apartment. Think of all that you have been put with, and convince yourself that you need to have this conversation. The sooner you deal with this the better. Do not put it off for later and give a chance for more issues to come up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make changes yourself</h3>



<p>If there is any way that you may have triggered your controlling roommate, try to see if you can do something. Clean up your space, be considerate, do your chores and give them their space. If there is something that you are doing wrong, try to make amends and see if your controlling roommate reacts to this positively.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lend an ear to them</h3>



<p>It could be that issues at work, college, or their personal life are the cause of their behavior. Make yourself more approachable and let them know you are there to lend an ear to them. If not, approach them and ask them how they are doing. Perhaps even share a few problems that you are having and take initiative. If they warm up to you and share their problems, then you may be on the path to a resolution.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Be sensitive and mindful</h3>



<p>When you sit down to have a conversation with your controlling roommate, be mindful of how you approach them. The last thing you want to do is come off as aggressive or antagonize your controlling roommate. Make sure you approach them in a friendly way. If you have common friends, you may want to discuss this with them and even have them there. Be sensitive and willing to hear if they have any issues.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exercise caution</h3>



<p>The last thing you want to do is trigger your controlling roommate. They could have a tendency to go off the hook. If you feel that things could head wildly South, then make sure you have a friend around. If things escalate, be ready to call building security, the management, or even the police. After all, you never know with people. The last thing you want is to get hurt or into a physical conflict.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Set rules</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s never too late to set rules. If you feel that setting rules and boundaries will help, sit your roommate down. You can make a set of rules and responsibilities to share. This may help with your situation and ease the tension. Be open to their suggestions as well, and try to make something that works for everyone. Remember your rights as a roommate too. You don&#8217;t need to cave into ridiculous suggestions from your controlling roommates.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Time for &#8216;the talk&#8217;</h3>



<p>No, not that one. Once you&#8217;ve gone over the situation and made your assessment, it is time for you to sit them down. Let them know honestly but in a sensitive and friendly way. Put your foot down and don&#8217;t budge if they are being unreasonable. However, be ready to back off if you feel the situation could escalate. This is the make or break part. All the best!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If all fails</h2>



<p>Maybe it just isn&#8217;t meant to be with your controlling roommate. Never mind. There are many fish (potential roommates) in the sea (city.) If they don&#8217;t value you, it could be time to search for a new roommate. Lucky for you, you&#8217;re already in the right place!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After many mindless hours of scrolling through endless social media posts every night, you might’ve developed the habit of shutting your laptop and leaving it casually on the coffee table. Do you think twice about locking it? Maybe not. Because some house rules are so common sense, you assume that even the worst roommate isn&#8217;t going to invade your privacy by snooping around. And most of us are lucky enough to never have this turn into an issue. But it can’t hurt to practice extra caution. Because in our world, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/safe-online-banking-tips-for-the-beginner/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bank accounts</a>, credit cards, and other private information are too readily available online. Thankfully, electronic devices are built with your security in mind. So even if you’re not necessarily worried about your roommate snooping around. And even if they aren&#8217;t bad roommates, there are a few simple security measures you should always take to protect your private info.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. General tips to protect your info from bad roommates who like to snoop around</h2>



<p>Let’s get some basics out of the way before we dive in. There are varying levels of security, depending on your (potential) problem. When you’re co-living, you should treat your devices the same as you would a public computer. When you log into Facebook on a library computer, you probably remember to log out of the site and the system, right? Because you don’t want a stranger posting something like “My mother is a hamster, and my father smells of elderberries,” on your page — among other strange, potentially obscene things. So do the same thing at home! Log out, or set your laptop/phone/tablet to lock after a few minutes of being inactive. This is a must, irrespective of whether you have bad roommates or good ones.</p>



<p>Charlie Cohn, Head of Marketing at college learning marketplace&nbsp;<a href="https://studysoup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">StudySoup</a>, points out that in some cases, the device you want to protect might not be yours alone. And for that, there’s a pretty simple solution.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“If you share a computer with a roommate or housemate, set up a different user profile for each person that uses the device,” Cohn says. “If it will prevent you from being able to easily open each others’ files or access websites where you are logged in.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Make sure if you have bad roommates who want to poke around, they encounter a password. Which brings us to our next point. Passwords! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Passwords</h2>



<p>Get a password. Better yet, get several passwords. Do you have the same password with different variations for each and every account you have on your devices and online? It’s not uncommon. But it’s very risky. Especially if you run across a phishing site that wrangles the information out of you. And can tell your friends about your hamster of a mother. And drain your bank account faster than you can type “OMG.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“It’s best to use complex and unique passwords so that one compromised password doesn’t allow someone to access all of your files,” says Randy Downs, an IT expert and owner of <a href="http://downsconsultingservices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downs Consulting Services.</a></p><p>“It does little good to password-protect your data if you leave the code lying around. Likewise, it’s not useful to have passwords that can be easily guessed, like your pet’s name or simply ‘password’.”</p></blockquote>



<p>So get several passwords, and make them complicated so your bad roommates are locked out of your personal stuff. The more important the device/site, the more complicated the password. Example: A good Neopets password (remember those things?) would be the name of your cat. A good bank account password would be something like N7P0Q1B8$A12L!. Luckily you don’t have to come up with something that crazy on your own. Websites like <a href="http://passwordsgenerator.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong Random Password</a>&nbsp;are free and let you generate secure passwords with multiple variables. Just remember to keep it safe somewhere and not super accessible.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What if your bad roommates are ultra tech savvy? </h3>



<p>Now let’s say the worst roommate is digging around. And they also happen to be an expert in the field of technology. You’re going to need some extra lock-down, and encryption is the way to go. Encryption is basically a password for your password to keep your bad roommates out of your digital stuff. When something has been encrypted, it garbles the data around into an unreadable mess. And the only way to translate (decrypt) it is to know the password.</p>



<p>Again, you need a good password, especially for these services. While this may sound complicated, it’s simply a matter of taking an extra step to know you’re extra secure.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Encryption is the way to go! </h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Encrypting devices such as iPhones can be as easy as going into Settings, enabling a strong passcode (i.e., six digits or more) and enabling data protection. Be very careful that you have the passcode written down somewhere safe as you can find yourself locked out as well. A six-digit passcode can take up to five years to guess if all combinations are used,” says Downs.</p></blockquote>



<p>Nicholas Larsen, a <a href="http://studentsuccess.uams.edu/2015/10/the-art-of-google-5-tips-to-enhance-your-search-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology support expert</a> at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, recommends that when you’re trying to encrypt your laptops and computers, you should look into the encryption services already provided on your operating system.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Windows offers <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/bitlocker-drive-encryption-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitLocker</a> for some users, and Macs inherently have FileVault — you just have to enable it,” he says.</p></blockquote>



<p>Randy Downs points out that commonly used email services like Gmail and Yahoo already use encryption. As do most WiFi routers. But it doesn’t hurt to verify.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“You should have WPA2 encryption on with a strong password and WPS off,” advises Downs.</p></blockquote>



<p>Finally, make sure your Cloud Data is protected as well; a strong password is again the key to keep your bad roommates out.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Even better, use cloud encryption like CloudFogger, which encrypts the data on your computer and decrypts as needed,” Downs says.</p></blockquote>



<p>To make a long story short, practicing good security methods at home doesn’t hurt, and it’s pretty simple. Whether it’s your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-my-roommate-is-driving-me-up-the-wall-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snooping roommate</a>, the stranger that found your phone on a city street, or the adept hacker that took your Twitter account and sent all those weird messages to your ex, a good password could make a world of difference.</p>
