										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The biggest cause of stress for most of us in New York isn’t the traffic or the neighbors, it&#8217;s rent. The <a href="https://www.rentdata.org/new-york-ny-hud-metro-fmr-area/2024" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Fair Market Rent</a> in NYC for a two-bedroom apartment costs $2,752 monthly, 99% more expensive than in other cities.</p>



<p>And if you ever wanted to take a trip then that NYC apartment can start to feel like a ball and chain. What do you do then? It’s simple, sublet.&nbsp;That’s how you can enjoy your freedom and take time off to see the rest of the world. Here’s everything you need to know on how to sublet in NYC.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at&nbsp;what a sublet is, what it isn’t, and how you can do it&nbsp;in The Big Apple.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-sublet">What is a &#8216;Sublet&#8217;?</h2>



<p>A sublet is like a temporary leave of absence. Say you’re going to Europe for a month or two, but surely, you&#8217;re coming back. With so many people looking for a place to stay in New York City, it wouldn’t make a lot of sense to let the apartment sit there all alone without someone to keep it company. And pay your lease while you’re away. That’s why you should sublet an apartment in NYC. Lots of people need a temporary place because they just got to the city and need time to find something more permanent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-sublet-in-nyc-is-not-forever">A Sublet In NYC Is Not Forever</h3>



<p>That’s the difference between a sublet and assigning a lease. If you intend to come back, you need a sublet. If you&#8217;re trying to get out of your lease and you want someone to take it over completely, then you’re assigning it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-find-a-sublet-in-nyc">How to Find a Sublet in NYC</h2>



<p>Okay. The City of Dreams sleeps on a big fluffy bed made out of paperwork, so make sure to check off all the little details. Here’s the basic overview of what to do subletting in NYC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-gather-all-information-needed">#1: Gather all information needed</h3>



<p>It’s gonna feel like a lot, but none of it should be too hard to get.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The sublease length of the apartment in NYC. How long are you going to be out of town?</li>



<li>The name and address of the tenant from whom you’re subletting in NYC. Hopefully, you found them on Roomi because then you can use the chat feature to get all that from them if you don’t have it already.</li>



<li>Why are you subletting? Basically, the reason for your decision to sublet an apartment in NYC. Traveling musician? Visit family? Hula dancing?</li>



<li>Written consent of anyone else who has the primary lease with you, such as a guarantor or cosigner. Your roommate would be in for a surprise if they see another person they don&#8217;t know in the apartment without any kind of warning.</li>



<li>Finally, a copy of your own lease, if you can.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-find-a-subletter">#2: Find a Subletter</h3>



<p>A subletter couldn&#8217;t just be anyone. Ideally, someone you already know and trust is already a good candidate. Asking friends and family if they know anyone looking for a place is also a good way to find a dependable subletter. But the best way is to use a reliable room and roommate finder app, like Roomi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="612" height="408" data-attachment-id="21183" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-sublet-in-nyc/attachment/find-a-subletter/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?fit=612%2C408&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="612,408" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Find a Subletter" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?fit=612%2C408&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?resize=612%2C408&#038;ssl=1" alt="Find a Subletter" class="wp-image-21183" style="width:853px;height:auto" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?w=612&amp;ssl=1 612w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></figure>

<p>With Roomi, you can list your room and have potential subletters right away. The app is safe with security and privacy measures like in-app messaging, thorough background checks, and ID verification. This ensures that you&#8217;re talking to a real person behind the account and not a scammer or fraudster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3: Be wary of rental scams!</h3>



<p>Scammers are everywhere but don&#8217;t let them come near your subletting process. Take note of these rental scams and don&#8217;t fall for any misleading links or ghost apartments.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fake rentals or listings: </strong>These are bogus property listings with attractive photos to lure renters and eventually scam them into making deposits, then disappearing right after.</li>



<li><strong>Overseas landlords: </strong>Some landlords say they&#8217;re in a different country so they can&#8217;t meet you in person. They&#8217;ll make you send an advanced payment to secure the apartment or for them to mail the keys to you, but once the money&#8217;s sent, they&#8217;re gone.</li>



<li><strong>Phishing scams: </strong>These are deceptive emails or messages asking people to click on malicious links or provide sensitive information to eventually scam the person.</li>



<li><strong>Identity theft: </strong>Just like phishing scams, identity theft is prevalent online. Scammers use a different person&#8217;s identity to pose as a landlord, providing valid IDs to earn the trust of renters, then once the payment&#8217;s been sent over and it&#8217;s time to get the keys, the property is already occupied or it doesn&#8217;t exist.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4: Check with your landlord</h3>



<p>Next, it’s your landlord’s part that moves the subletting process further. They might have more questions or need additional info. If they do, get it to them as soon as you can. Remember, you have to send a written request with all that jazz to your landlord. Use certified mail, and make sure to ask for a return receipt. Once you send off any extra stuff, the 30-day countdown begins.</p>

<p>Your landlord’s got 30 days to say yes or no. If they don’t get back to you at all, then that counts as a yes. Now, you can have a great sublet experience in NYC!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5: Make a backup plan, just in case!</h3>



<p>Although settling your subletting situation takes a lot of work, it&#8217;s best to have a backup plan just in case. Set aside some extra money if your subletter doesn&#8217;t push through or there&#8217;s any mishap that happens, at least you&#8217;re prepared!</p>



<p>You can also have someone check in with you in case your subletter stops communicating with you, or they can&#8217;t pay a month&#8217;s rent for any reason. Remember, subletting is different than becoming a part of or signing a lease.</p>



<p>Now, it’s New York, so it shouldn’t come as a big shock to find out there are exceptions and special circumstances. Check out the “Tenant’s Rights” document, courtesy of the Attorney General, for more information that’ll make a sublet in NYC way easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time To Sublet!</h2>



<p>In the exciting world of subletting in NYC, the possibilities are endless! With the right information and resources, you can navigate the sublet market with confidence. Just remember to plan everything down to a T, beware of rental scams, have a backup plan, use a reliable room finder, and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>

<p>Thinking of going on a short vacation, but don&#8217;t want to keep paying rent while you&#8217;re not staying in the apartment? Subletting is the solution for you. To sublet means to rent out a room that&#8217;s already being rented for a short period of time. It&#8217;s a great idea to ensure your rent is paid and your room is still intact when you return. However, it&#8217;s important to do your research about NYC subletting laws before starting anything.</p>



<p>Remember that there are terms and conditions, and the rights to sublet involved in the process before you make money subletting. It isn’t as simple as saying ‘I want to sublet my room’ to a friend who pays your rent for you.</p>



<p>In fact, in some states, you can go to prison if you’re found subletting your room without getting your landlord’s approval! Make sure you’re following the rules and know all about the laws for subletting in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-things-to-know-before-subletting">5 Things to Know Before Subletting</h2>



<p>New Yorkers, if you’re thinking of subletting your room, you have more flexibility than other renters across America! It’s the only other jurisdiction (alongside <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/lifestyle/things-to-know-when-moving-to-chicago-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Chicago</a>) where subletting your room is allowed. That too, even if your landlord denies or ignores your request. But there are laws in place and some restrictions in subletting. Here are five things you need to know about NYC subletting laws:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-confirm-if-you-re-able-to-sublet-in-your-apartment">#1: Confirm if you&#8217;re able to sublet in your apartment</h3>



<p>Although subletting is legal in New York, there are restrictions in place for certain types of apartments. If you fall under&nbsp;any of the following categories, you&nbsp;may not&nbsp;have the right to sublet your room. So make sure you get permission from the relevant body in writing before starting to make money subletting:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Public housing residents or those who receive rent subsidies don&#8217;t have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Tenants that live in non-profit buildings don&#8217;t have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Tenants in co-op and condo apartments should consult their proprietary lease. Also check the building’s by-laws, as they may not have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Rent-stabilized tenants can sublet with a few restrictions: 1.) You have to maintain the apartment as your primary residence; 2.) You can&#8217;t charge more than the asking rent; 3.) You can&#8217;t sublet for more than 2 years.</li>



<li>Rent-controlled tenants don&#8217;t have the right to sublet by law and should check the clauses of their lease.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-let-your-landlord-know-through-writing">#2: Let your landlord know through writing</h3>



<p>The first step to subletting your apartment is to let your landlord know your plans to sublet 30 days before. You have to submit the following information by certified mail, return receipt requested:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The term and reason for subletting</li>



<li>The name of the person you’re subletting your room to</li>



<li>The business and permanent home address of the person subletting</li>



<li>Your address for the term of the sublet</li>



<li>Written consent from co-tenants or guarantor on the lease</li>



<li>A copy of the proposed sublease acknowledged by the main tenant and subtenant</li>
</ul>

<p>Your landlord has 10 days to ask for additional information, as long as it&#8217;s within reason. Then, if they fail to notify you whether they approve or reject your request within 30 days of your submission, it&#8217;s considered consent to sublet. However,&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">your landlord</a>&nbsp;can withhold the request if they have a good reason. As a result, you won’t be permitted to sublet your room by law. In circumstances where the landlord unreasonably withholds consent, you can go ahead with subletting your room anyway.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3: Subletting means you have to return to your apartment</h3>



<p>For subletting your room legally, you must plan on returning to the property once the term for subletting your room is up. If you think you’ll be gone for longer, speak to your landlord about breaking or re-assigning your lease to determine what the process should be.</p>



<p>As mentioned, you must have plans to return to the property after the term of subletting your room is over. But what happens when everything is going swimmingly? And you don’t want to go back to the room, and the new tenant has settled in? Can they take over your lease as per the right to sublet? Yes, they can.</p>



<p>Under NYC subletting laws, you must obtain written consent from the owner before proceeding. The owner is under no obligation to give their consent, nor do they have to provide a reason for denying the lease takeover.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4: Be aware of legal issues surrounding subletting</h3>



<p>If your landlord declines your request, and you still let another person sublet your room, there&#8217;s a high chance that you&#8217;ll be evicted for lease violations depending on your lease. With NYC subletting laws, certain legal issues could easily be avoided as long as you&#8217;re careful in planning and have everything in writing.</p>

<p>If your landlord rejects your request and you still proceed to sublet your room, you may face eviction. A case can be filed and if you lose, you can still keep the apartment by having the subtenant (the person subletting) move out within 10 days of the judgment. Either way, you&#8217;ll probably still pay your landlord&#8217;s attorney&#8217;s fees if your lease has an attorney&#8217;s fees clause. So, make sure to check and review your lease well.</p>



<p>One thing to consider is if you can actually make money while subletting, and the simple answer is yes, you can, with a few limitations. The right to sublet allows adding an extra 10% of the monthly rent onto the price when subletting your room. But only as long as the place is furnished. Your landlord also has the right to “sublet allowance,&#8221; another 10% of the monthly rent.</p>



<p>So as per NYC subletting laws, you can rent the room at 20% more than you pay. If you’re adding on more and the new tenant finds out, they can file a complaint and you’d have to pay a heavy fine.&nbsp;But if you&#8217;re in a rent-stabilized apartment, you can&#8217;t charge more than your current rent. <a href="https://hcr.ny.gov/office-rent-administration-ora#contact-ora" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)</a>&nbsp;is the state agency that governs this and contains up-to-date information regarding the latest updates to the right to sublet.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also the issue of illusory sublets where the main tenant hasn&#8217;t been in the apartment, meaning it isn&#8217;t their primary residence violating NYC subletting laws. A complaint can be filed by the cotentant which will require the owner to recognize the subtenant as the actual tenant who can renew their lease.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5: You can use an online tool to help sublet your room</h3>



<p>You can use an online room and roommate finder tool, like Roomi, to help streamline your subletting process. Roomi is a trusted online platform with listings and verified users around the globe.

<p>Aside from the app&#8217;s safety features, Roomi makes searching for apartments easier. You can choose to show only ID-verified users, price, duration, apartment layout, what kind of property, the number of bedrooms, and amenities available.</p>



<p>And the best part? It&#8217;s totally free to get started.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pick your borough and neighborhood</h3>



<p>There are five boroughs in New York: Manhattan, <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/the-top-neighborhoods-to-live-in-brooklyn-for-young-professionals-in-2023/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/brooklyn-vs-queens/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Queens</a>, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Each of these boroughs has its own personality, so it&#8217;s best to visit each one of them before moving to get a feel of where you feel you&#8217;ll fit in best. You can go on a tour around the boroughs if you&#8217;ve never been at all to know more about the area and New York, in general.</p>



<p>After going through the boroughs and choosing one, it&#8217;s time to decide on which neighborhood you&#8217;re moving to. All boroughs are full of varying neighborhoods that can look and feel different although they&#8217;re just blocks away from each other. If you&#8217;re unsure how to choose, consider these factors:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How expensive/cheap is the housing?</li>



<li>How walkable is the neighborhood? Is it safe to walk around alone?</li>



<li>How is the commute to work/university going to be?</li>



<li>Are there open spaces like parks or green spaces to spend some free time in?</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Decide on the space that you need</h3>



<p>When moving places in general, it&#8217;s important to decide how much space you&#8217;ll need so you know what kind of place to look for. Here are some points to consider:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Will you work from home and need a space to work in?</li>



<li>Do you have a pet or are you planning to get one?</li>



<li>Are you thinking of having children anytime soon?</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Prepare your budget</h3>



<p>New York is an expensive city. Housing and cheap furniture can be difficult to find, owning a car isn&#8217;t advisable, and food prices are regularly increasing. This is why when planning your move to NYC, you have to plan and prepare your budget well.</p>

<p>And you don&#8217;t just consider housing, you have to include food, groceries, personal expenses, transportation expenses, moving supplies, moving fees, etc. Planning your budget to a T will help you estimate your expected overall expenses and save you from spending extra.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don’t be afraid to shop around when moving to NYC</h3>



<p>With all of the online shopping services today, you&#8217;re probably well-versed in checking multiple sites and price-checking different products, so it&#8217;s necessary to do the same when moving to NYC.</p>



<p>But &#8216;to shop around&#8217; means to look at multiple apartments, ask around for recommended moving companies (if you need them), read some reviews online, and walk around the area you want. Just make sure that, if you&#8217;re hiring any person or company to help you out, you hire someone who can do the work for the budget that you have.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Get all the information you can ahead of time</h3>



<p>Just like tip #5 above, it&#8217;s essential that once you have a list of potential movers or companies, do extensive research about them. Read reviews, look for bloggers who talked about moving and used the same companies, and ask friends and families for recommendations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Do everything you can possibly do before the movers to where you’re moving in NYC</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve sorted your things, moved everything to boxes, have hired movers, and you&#8217;re just a day or two away from finally moving to NYC, make sure that everything&#8217;s set before your movers arrive. By &#8216;everything&#8217;s set&#8217;, that means you&#8217;ve packed everything ready to go for the movers to quickly transport your stuff from your apartment to the truck.</p>



<p>Remember, even the most trustworthy movers can’t be superheroes. Movers come to do their job so make sure there is not still food in the fridge and you’re not in a robe. If movers charge hourly, save yourself money by making boxes easily accessible, big and heavy in the front, smalls in the back.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Find a roommate</h3>



<p>Living alone in an expensive city, like New York, isn&#8217;t practical due to the high cost of living. It&#8217;s ultimately better for your savings account to share expenses with a roommate. Not only can you save up on your finances, but you also gain a new friend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you’re thinking of looking for an apartment but don’t really know where to start, we’ve got you! We understand the stress of planning to move, apartment hunting, and even budgeting. More than that, there’s always this question of, “when should I start looking for an apartment?”. The apartment rental market can be unpredictable, so having an apartment hunting timeline is the best way to prepare for your move.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When Should I Start Looking for an Apartment?</h2>





<p><a href="https://au.reachout.com/-/media/young-people/images/legacy-articles/moving-boxes-around.jpg">Source</a></p>



<p>If you’re planning to move out, the question of when to look for an apartment totally depends on you. But, there’s an apartment hunting timeline you can follow that’s easy and will make moving out totally hassle free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Ideal Apartment Hunting Timeline</h3>



<p><strong>2-3 months before moving in:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Do your research.</strong> There are a lot of things you should consider before actually moving in. The first is deciding when and where: when’s your move-in date and where you’ll be moving in. Your move-in date is crucial because you’d have to think of your current lease, your job, and even insurance policies.</li>



<li><strong>Start budgeting.</strong> The second step is knowing your budget and sticking to it! Once you have a move-in date, you’ll be able to get a better grasp on when you need to start allotting money for your new apartment. Plus, getting a head start on an apartment fund can be beneficial for you; you can have extra cash in case of emergencies.</li>



<li><strong>Understand how applying for apartments work.</strong> Once you have your date and budget, knowing how applying and renting apartments work. This way, you can prepare any extra documents that’ll take time to get, just in case.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>24 to 30 days before moving in:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prepare all requirements.</strong> Having all of your documents ready before starting to look is one of the best apartment hunting tips you should know. This way, the application process will be a lot more smoother and hassle-free.</li>



<li><strong>Tour apartments.</strong> Now, a lot of people ask, “when should I start looking for an apartment?” there’s an ideal time frame for this! Looking three to four months out is too far, and two weeks is cutting it too short. Usually, apartments are listed 24 to 30 days before the move-in date, so an apartment available on September 1 will probably be put on the market on August 1.</li>



<li><strong>Make a list.</strong> Now that you somewhat have an idea where you’ll be moving to, it’s best to list down your top choices, from the type of apartment, to the available amenities, accessibility, how close it is to your work, the hospital, banks, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Put in an application on your top pick.</strong> Once you have everything and you’re set on a place, put in a rental application. Usually, you’ll know whether you’re approved or not within five business days.</li>



<li><strong>Confirm the move-in date and start packing.</strong> If you have any more outstanding paperwork to sign, this is the best time to schedule a time for it. Make sure that all the documents you need are good to go.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>7 days before moving in:</strong></p>





<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/UTw3j_aoIKM">Source</a></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Confirm your moving details.</strong> Whether you booked movers or asked help from friends, this is the time to finalize all the details.</li>



<li><strong>Pack all your essentials in one bag.</strong> Put at least a few days worth of clothing, necessities, paper work, and important IDs in one bag for easy access. In case you need anything, it’ll be easier to find and get.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Moving day:</strong></p>



<p>On the day of your move-in, it can get a bit stressful. But if you followed the timeline and have all your documents ready, you don’t have to worry. You can expect the unexpected, but by the end of the day, you’ll be in your new apartment!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Apartment Hunting Tips</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Think about what you really need in an apartment. When searching for apartments, it’s important to think of your needs more than your wants. Do you really need that extra room or is one enough?</li>



<li>Familiarize yourself with the lease terms and obligations. Before signing anything, take time to review it. If the landlord seems like they don’t want you to go through it, that’s generally a bad sign. Without reading the lease terms, you may be signing yourself up for terms you disapprove. Also, come prepared with a list of questions when meeting with the landlord! Make sure that if you’re planning to sign the contract and live there, your living situation is the best for you (and your landlord).</li>



<li>Be wary of rental scams. If you’re planning to move, make sure that you have your guards up. Use <a href="https://roomiapp.com/">trusted room finders</a>, do reverse image searching, and meet the landlord or property manager before paying a deposit. Rental scams will always be there, but you can avoid it!</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking for new places to grab a quick and economical bite to eat in the Big Apple? Street food in NYC has always been a big part of the city’s culture. Rich or broke, young or old, there can’t be many New Yorkers that wouldn’t readily agree to a hot dog.</p>



<p>The tricky thing about food carts, however, is that they’re constantly on the move. So, if you like one, you’d better save their phone number!</p>



<p>To help you keep track, we’ve pinned down the current locations of all the best street food vendors in NYC. You could be a newbie to New York or a native, looking for that one food cart you loved but lost. Whatever the case may be, the food trucks on this list will not disappoint you!</p>



<p>Take a look below.</p>

<p>Located in Washington Square Park, this food cart operates from 11am &#8211; 3pm every day except Sundays. It serves authentic South Indian food so good that it’s even got its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NY_Dosas" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>



<p>The cart is owned and run by just one man, Thiru Kumar, who’s basically a local celebrity. And he makes some of the best Indian street food in NYC. The dosas (a savory, Indian-style crepe) and samosas are its most popular items, highly sought-after by college students.</p>



<p>The dosas are served with sambhar and coconut chutney. And unlike a lot of street food in NYC, all the food is fully vegan and gluten-free. After finishing your mouthwatering meal, you can pay by either cash or Venmo.</p>



<p>Thiru posts regular updates about the cart on his <a href="https://twitter.com/nydosas?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nydosas/?hl=en" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> pages.

<p>Mom’s Momo serves some of the most famous street food in New York. It&#8217;s located in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/UvPA3n1mz8Q5kE7n7" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackson Heights</a> and serves traditional Tibetan cuisine. Momos are steamed flour dumplings, usually filled with meat or vegetables, and served with spicy schezwan sauce. As far as street food in NYC goes, there aren’t many carts that serve momos like this!</p>



<p>Mom’s doesn’t have a large menu, which we feel adds to its appeal. They serve a select few dishes that will leave you licking your fingers off. One review states, “The dumplings were a form of perfection never before realized on this planet.” Need we say more?</p>



<p>So forget the FOMO and just try these momos. For regular updates, you can follow their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/momsmomo18/?hl=en" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page. And, if Jackson Heights is too far, you can check out their second truck in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cBCDf8JDoGsKrsBH8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Queens Boulevard, Sunnyside</a>.</p>

<p>Operating since 1982, Ling’s serves some of the best Manhattan street food. From its name, you can probably tell that the cart serves sweet cakes. For just $1, you can buy a bag full of the original-flavored fried cakes. Their fluffiness makes it super easy for you to finish them off without much help!</p>



<p>While these cakes are also served with multiple condiments, Ling’s regulars suggest eating them as they are. So, for some of the lightest and sweetest street food in NYC, give Ling’s shot.</p>



<p>Ling’s is located on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/e81ZA8yNiLVVMyQB6" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Manhattan’s Canal Street, Chinatown</a>. And, though not very active, you can visit their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LingsSweetMiniCakes/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> page to learn more about them!</p>

<p>Kwik Meal is owned and run by former Russian Tea Room chef, Muhammed Rahman. The most talked-about and sought-after meal at this Manhattan street food cart is its marinated lamb.</p>



<p>The lamb is marinated overnight in multiple spices, yogurt, and green papaya. Then it’s served up in a slice of pitta bread or over a plate of basmati rice. We think it’s some of the tastiest street food in NYC.</p>



<p>Is your mouth watering yet? The cart’s owner is also quite a treat, serving up fun conversations along with his food. Catch this famous food cart on the <a href="https://g.page/KwikMealNYC?share" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">6th Avenue</a> of Manhattan and follow their <a href="https://m.facebook.com/373209939376999/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> page for more updates!</p>

<p>The Halal Guys is a chain of street food carts operating across New York City. Considering the lawsuits they’ve had to file on various impersonators, they’re definitely serving the most famous street food in NYC.</p>



<p>The original Halal Guys have been around since 1990 and have an ever-increasing fanbase. As suggested by many reviews, their white sauce is a definite must with whatever dish you choose.</p>



<p>These guys are so popular that they have their own <a href="https://thehalalguys.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>, as well as an app! They also offer the option to start a franchise, if you’re interested in that. You can find the cart nearest to you using the website’s <a href="https://thehalalguys.com/locations/location-finder/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">location finder</a>.</p>

<p>Indian King Biryani House, as its name might suggest, serves up some of the best Indian street food in NYC. As you can see from the picture, this food cart has got quite a vast menu. That doesn’t make its food any less amazing, however.</p>



<p>On the contrary, the chicken biryani served here is a foodie favorite, with meat that’s super tender and well spiced. Besides that, some other popular dishes are chicken tikka, kati rolls, and samosa.</p>



<p>For some of the spiciest and best street food in NYC, catch Indian King Biryani House on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/17sGTnTKdkb8wncC6" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Broadway</a>. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find any social media handles for this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving to a new city can be both an exhilarating and challenging experience. While you&#8217;re excited to work in a different environment and meet new people, finding the perfect apartment can be daunting. Apart from the location, you also have to worry about having a rental cost that fits your budget and needs. Roomi and Apartment List are apps that can help you find rooms for rent on top of other services and features.</p>



<p>You may be asking yourself, &#8220;Is Apartment List legit?&#8221; How does Roomi verify users? How do you know if the listings are credible? If you&#8217;re planning on finding out the answers to these, we&#8217;ve saved you the time by comparing them for you. Here&#8217;s our Roomi and Apartment List review to get you started.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room"><strong>Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?</strong></h2>

<p>No one wants to go through dozens of room finders and reviews just to find the perfect room for rent. Each room finder may have unique features and services, but how many really give you value for your money? Only a comprehensive Roomi and Apartment List review will give you the answers you need. Let&#8217;s put the two apps head-to-head to see which app has the best tools for a seamless experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No fee apartments</h3>



<p>Is Apartment List legit? To list a property on Apartment List, there are pricing options that cater to your requirements. These aren&#8217;t publicly listed, so you&#8217;ll need to email Apartment List to get a customized package. With Apartment List alternative Roomi, you don&#8217;t need to pay any fees to sign up and list a property. It&#8217;s absolutely free. Under a free account, you can also send up to five messages or swipes per day and activate up to two listings. It is therefore much easier to list a property on Roomi.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>



<p>Websites like Apartment List don&#8217;t really let you specify if having pets around is okay or a no-go, which is a bit of a bummer if you&#8217;re planning on moving with a furry friend. Meanwhile, Roomi lets you tick a filter so you can find pet-friendly apartments &#8211; great news for you and your puppy!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s an Apartment List review on subletting. Okay, so this isn&#8217;t an issue with Apartment List. If you&#8217;re a tenant wanting to sublet a room or an entire apartment, you&#8217;ll need to discuss this directly with the landlord or homeowner. The same goes for Apartment List alternative Roomi, and it&#8217;s even explicitly stated on its homepage. The great thing about Roomi is that it also helps you safely find roommates, or, in this case, sublessees.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>When using websites like Apartment List, you can choose which amenities matter most to you. Options include accessibility, air conditioning, grilling equipment, down to ice makers, dishwashers, in-unit laundry, parking, and swimming pools, among other. With Roomi, on the other hand, you can choose all of the above plus also specify if you want an elevator, TV, and Wi-Fi. These are features not listed under Apartment List&#8217;s filter for amenities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type (entire place/shared rooms)</h3>



<p>For this Apartment List review, we&#8217;ve found that you can indicate an entire place or just a bed or two. But the app doesn&#8217;t allow you to specify if you want to share a room, which is important if you&#8217;re cash-strapped. Under a Roomi account, you can choose from the entire place, a private room, or a shared room.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>



<p>As far as the house rules filter goes for websites like Apartment List, there&#8217;s not much to say. That&#8217;s because you won&#8217;t find any. With Roomi, meanwhile, you can really find your ideal place. With this Apartment List alternative, you can specify if you prefer non-smokers and whether you mind having couples or pets around.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Which app offers the best free and paid features?</h2>

<p>No Apartment List or Roomi review would be complete without a comparison of their free and paid features. After all, you don&#8217;t want to end up paying for a room finder that doesn&#8217;t really give you helpful features and services. Although Apartment List lets you list properties for free, you pay a back-end fee when someone books through the app.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s great to know that Roomi has amazing features that you can benefit from without needing to pay a single cent. Here are just some amazing ones that you can enjoy as a free user.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing free listings</h3>



<p>With Roomi, you can list up to two properties for free. You can also use these to activate any pending or deactivated listings. When signing up for a Roomi Gold subscription, you get an even bigger bang for your buck. First, you need to choose between a personal or a business plan. Personal users get unlimited messaging, identity verification, and a ranking boost for seven times more views on listings. Depending on the business tier you choose, you can get a verified partner badge, unlimited listings, and unlimited messaging. Pay either $29.99 for one month or $14.99 per week.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-app messaging</h3>



<p>We&#8217;re all aware of the presence of hackers and false profiles online. You&#8217;ll be happy to know that Apartment List alternative Roomi guarantees secure in-app messaging so you can keep your communication private. You can also easily message a property owner on Apartment List, but the app doesn&#8217;t really offer a specialized privacy or security feature for its users.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that Roomi gives you greater value for your money with both of its free and paid features.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:83%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/dXFKDUolyLLi8gq6Cl" title="is it true"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>On Apartment List, when signing up, you&#8217;ll need to provide your name, contact info, budget, income, renter history, and apartment preferences. While there are listings labeled as &#8220;verified,&#8221; Apartment List does not mention any investment in tech to automate user verification.</p>



<p>As an Apartment List alternative, Roomi verifies a user&#8217;s phone number and email address with GlobaliD, a digital identity platform. Users need to create a GlobaliD and connect it with Roomi. Through this system, GlobaliD verifications describe something about users that a third-party agency has verified to be true. This feature goes to show that Roomi puts a premium on keeping users&#8217; information secure and verifying users&#8217; authenticity. That&#8217;s fewer points for this part of the Apartment List review.</p>



<p>Your private data is safely stored in the GlobaliD vault, which cannot be accessed or shared without your explicit consent. This means that your data isn’t stored on each new service provider you choose to connect to your GlobaliD. In case Roomi gets hacked, know that your data is secure as it is not kept on Roomi servers. On top of the GDPR, Roomi users can enjoy secure in-app messaging to contact potential roommates without sharing personal info.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you"><strong>So, which is the best room finder for you?</strong></h2>



<p>With all the features mentioned above, we hope this comparative Roomi review and Apartment List review helps you as you move to a new city. We know, no matter how many times you move, it never gets any easier. But having the technology to speed up the process of finding a place and roommates definitely helps. Especially when you know it invests in safety and data privacy, as well as affordable pricing. Knowing your data and transactions are protected gives you undeniable peace of mind.</p>



<p>This is why Apartment List alternative Roomi is naturally the best room finder out there. It ensures real people are signed into the app, keeps in-app messaging secure, and uses a state-of-the-art digital identity platform to add an additional layer of security. Plus, you can benefit from using the app whether as a free or paid user. You get the leads that you want and the peace of mind that you deserve.</p>



<p>As an all-in-one app offering all of these features and more to help you find the best room, Roomi is clearly the best room finder for you.</p>

<p>Did you know that landlords are prohibited from refusing to rent to a potential tenant based on prior landlord-tenant litigation or tenant screening reports?</p>



<p>Also, landlords can’t charge apartment application fees, and the maximum amount for background and credit checks is $20. Even at that, the fee must be waived if the prospective tenant provides a recent copy(30 days) of their background and credit check.</p>



<p>Knowledge is power especially in a place like New York, where renting is a herculean task. During your stay (or even when you’re finding the apartment) you need to be well versed with rental laws, so you can get exactly what you signed up for.</p>



<p>And if you don’t know them yet, no worries. That’s what we’re here for! In this blog, we’ll be sharing a list of landlord responsibilities and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/five-common-questions-about-renters-rights-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">renters’ rights in NYC</a>. Let’s get started!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="0-tenants-laws-amp-rights-in-nyc">Tenants Laws &amp; Rights in NYC</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-1-broker%E2%80%99s-fee">1. Broker’s Fee</h2>



<p>Paying a broker fee on top of the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/ways-to-get-around-40x-rent-rule-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">40x rent rule</a> to rent in NYC can be super expensive. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/brokers-fee-in-nyc-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Broker’s fees in NYC</a> are generally between 10 to 15 percent of the annual rent.</p>



<p>The thing is, if you don’t want to deal with a broker, you can opt for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finding-no-fee-apartments-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">no-fee apartments in NYC</a>. This means that the landlord will pay a fee to the broker who assists with the listing.</p>



<p>If you’re being charged additional fees (commonly called ‘key money’) above the standard rent, security deposit, or broker fees, your rights are being infringed upon. Key money is illegal and you shouldn’t be subjected to paying such fees.</p>

<p>Rent-stabilized apartments protect tenants from excessive rent hikes, making apartments slightly more affordable. On the other hand, rent-controlled apartments are not available for rent for everyone. They can only be passed to family members.</p>



<p>Before moving into a rent-stabilized apartment, request for the apartment’s rent history to ensure you’re not being charged higher than usual. You should also be guaranteed a lease renewal at the end of the lease term.</p>



<p>Living in a rent-stabilized apartment means that increase in <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-rental-fees-can-landlord-legally-charge/96/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">apartment rental fees</a> is regulated and landlords cannot increase the rent price anyway they like.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-3-right-to-form-a-tenants%E2%80%99-association">3. Right to form a tenants’ association</h2>



<p>If you find yourself living in an apartment with too many issues, you have the <a href="https://www.metcouncilonhousing.org/help-answers/forming-a-tenants-association/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">right to form an association</a> with your fellow tenants. This way, you can achieve strength in numbers and ensure that the landlord doesn’t escape his responsibilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-4-reporting-issues-on-time">4. Reporting issues on time</h2>



<p>As a tenant, try not to hold off issues about your rental situation until it’s too late. Reporting your problems to the landlord or property manager on time can help solve them sooner.</p>



<p>You can report to the housing department if you voice out your complaints repeatedly and nothing is being done to fix them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-5-security-deposit-regulations">5. Security deposit regulations</h2>



<p>In NYC, your landlord is never allowed to charge more than one month of rent for a <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01616" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">security deposit</a>. The deposit must be returned in full within 14 days of the termination of your lease. However, this only applies when no damage was done to the apartment.</p>



<p>If any amount is withheld by the landlord for damage repairs, he has to submit an itemized list of any deductions made for those fixes.</p>

<p>Before <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">signing a lease in New York</a>, the landlord has to give you certain information about the rental unit. These are known as mandatory disclosures and if not presented while renting, you can request to see them by law. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lead paint hazards</strong>: This is for all the landlords owning properties that were built before 1978. You can request to see the Lead Paint disclosure form when signing your lease.</li>



<li><strong>Presence of bedbugs</strong>: The landlord needs to share the history of bed bug infestation with the tenant.</li>



<li><strong>Authorized parties</strong>: You have the right to know the names and addresses of all parties involved in the ownership or management of the property.</li>



<li><strong>Security deposit information</strong>: Landlords should disclose the location of any security deposits in their possession throughout the tenant’s lease.</li>



<li><strong>Functioning fire sprinkler system</strong>: Tenants should know whether the fire sprinkler system is fully operational.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-7-using-a-co-signer">7. Using a co-signer?</h2>



<p>A co-signer is a person who signs a lease agreement with you, though they don’t live in the property. They ensure the landlord(legally) that they will pay the rent, in case you can’t.</p>



<p>If you don’t have a good credit score, or you’re a student without a means of employment, then your best bet is using a co-signer.</p>



<p>It’s advisable to ask a family member or close friend who’s capable to act as an <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-co-signer-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">apartment co-signer</a>.</p>

<p>Tenants are allowed to keep pets in their apartments unless their lease specifically prohibits it. If tenants violate the lease’s provision forbidding pets, it can be a basis for eviction.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/renters-rights-can-landlord-refuse-service-animal/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Refusing a service animal</a> for tenants with psychiatric or physical disabilities is not permitted even if the clause has a no-pet policy.</p>



<p>Also, many animals cannot be kept legally as pets in NYC. Always check with your landlord and describe your pets, age, temperament, and breed. You can also call 311 to get further information on pet regulations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-9-the-right-to-have-roommates-or-subletters">9. The right to have roommates or subletters</h2>



<p>If you are a New York City tenant, you can bring in a roommate even though the person’s name isn’t on the lease. It doesn’t matter whether the person is a relative or not.</p>



<p>In addition, you have a right to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/is-it-legal-sublet-room-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sublease your room legally</a>. This applies to tenants in privately-owned buildings that house four or more apartments. You also have to sublet for 30 days (or longer). Take note that these rules don’t apply to rent-controlled apartments.</p>



<p>Here’s what you should do if you wish to sublet:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Send a written request to your landlord by certified mail, return receipt requested. Your request should contain:</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the length of the sublease;</li>



<li>the name, home, and business address of the proposed subtenant;</li>



<li>the reason for subletting;</li>



<li>the tenant’s address during the sublet;</li>



<li>the written consent of any co-tenant or guarantor;</li>



<li>a copy of the proposed sublease together with a copy of the tenant’s lease, if available.</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Your landlord may ask for additional information within ten days of you mailing your request.</li>



<li>Within 30 days of mailing your sublet request, the landlord is required to send you a notice of consent. If consent is denied, there must be reasons for the denial. If your landlord fails to send this written notice, it is automatically considered a consent to sublet.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-10-right-to-a-day-in-court-without-eviction">10. Right to a day in court without eviction</h2>



<p>You can’t be evicted from your apartment without your day in court. Your landlord is to state reasons for eviction, including non-payment of rent or lease violation.</p>



<p>If these issues aren’t resolved, the landlord is legally allowed to take the tenant to court. Only when the judge has ruled in favor of the landlord can a tenant be removed from the apartment.</p>

<p>The Small Claims Court is an NYC court for cases where the monetary amount sought is less than $5,000. Commonly called the “People’s Court,” the Small Claims Court is affordable and accessible to people of all backgrounds. You also don’t need to hire a lawyer.</p>



<p>As a tenant, you can use the Small Claims Court to recover an unreturned&nbsp;security deposit. If deductions to a security deposit can’t be solved with the landlord, tenants can also take the case up in Court.</p>



<p>Small Claims Court process:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You should be able to explain your reason for the case properly, and the amount you’re requesting (remember, nothing more than $5,000).</li>



<li>To start your process, acquire a court form from a Small Claims Court clerk in your county and fill it out.</li>



<li>You can file the form at the clerk’s office or by mail.</li>



<li>To open a case for claims of up to $1,000, you need to pay a small fee of $15. For cases of $1,000 to $5,000, the fee is $20.</li>



<li>After your case is filed, wait for the court to notify you on whether they will move forward with the case or not.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-12-tenant%E2%80%99s-right-to-withhold-rent">12. Tenant’s right to withhold rent</h2>



<p>Landlords must keep their rental properties in a good and safe state. If they fail to do this, tenants have the right to withhold rent until they fulfill their responsibilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-13-document-and-record-interactions">13. Document and record interactions</h2>

For example, you may have been clamoring for an apartment repair without a solution from your landlord.</p>



<p>Be sure to take notes or pictures and keep records of whatever issues you&#8217;ve been having, especially the ones that may give you an edge during a court case. You could also document your attempts to contact your landlord.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-14-the-right-to-habitable-housing">14. The right to habitable housing</h2>



<p>In NYC, it&#8217;s a legal right of the tenant to live in a habitable dwelling provided by the landlord. As a renter, one of the most important <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">questions to ask your landlord</a> is whether the necessary <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-apartment-features-check-signing-lease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">apartment features</a> are to be present.</p>



<p>Landlords are also supposed to maintain their rental property safely and decently. They should respond to repair requests without delay.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="15-landlord-responsibilities">Landlord Responsibilities</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="16-1-no-harassment-and-discrimination-of-tenants">1. No harassment and discrimination of tenants</h3>



<p>Fair Housing laws in NYC prohibit landlords from discriminating against renters based on their religion, gender, race, nationality, income type, or sexual orientation. Harassment in the form of verbal or physical abuse, consistent withholding of services, or persistent physical or mental intimidation is also illegal.</p>



<p>The law also provides that renters with disabilities are qualified for amenities that allow ease of access into their homes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="17-2-no-changing-of-locks-without-giving-the-resident-the-key">2. No changing of locks without giving the resident the key</h3>



<p>It’s illegal for a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/can-landlord-lock-legally/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">landlord to change locks</a> on your apartment without giving you a key. This act is a clear violation of the Unlawful Eviction Law, especially in situations when:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>the landlord does not have a warrant of eviction</li>



<li>a resident is a tenant or subtenant with a lease,</li>



<li>the resident is an occupant who has lawfully lived in the apartment for more than thirty days (with or without the lease),</li>



<li>a subtenant or roommate has lived in the apartment for at least thirty days (even if the person is not on the lease).</li>
</ul>



<p>In some cases, you can ask your landlord to change the locks if you don’t have a standard <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-security-system/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">apartment security system</a>. This way, you’ll keep out previous tenants who may have an extra set of keys for your home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="18-3-no-unwarranted-entering-of-a-tenant%E2%80%99s-home">3. No unwarranted entering of a tenant’s home</h3>



<p>Tenants have the right to privacy within their apartments. Generally, landlords do not enter a tenant’s home anytime they wish. There are exceptions to this, however. Landlords may visit their tenant’s apartment with prior notice at a reasonable time, with the tenant’s consent to provide necessary repairs and services, or per the lease.</p>

<p>Landlords and property managers make sure that your apartment is void of any faults or malfunctions.</p>



<p>In the case of any malfunction, the landlord has to respond to the tenant’s repair notice if it’s a legitimate request. Three things happen when a landlord fails to rectify the issue: the tenant may choose to withhold rent, use their Repair and Deduct rights, or seek legal advice.</p>



<p>Landlords are responsible for fixing broken heating, plumbing issues, <a href="https://www.smartchoiceroofrestorations.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaking roof issues</a>, broken doors/windows/ceilings, and any other appliance added to the lease.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="20-5-extermination-of-vermin">5. Extermination of vermin</h3>



<p>Property owners are to provide an environment free from such pests as roaches, mice, and bedbugs. Keeping apartments clean and safe from these uninvited guests is an unnegotiable responsibility of NYC landlords.</p>



<p>Tenants shouldn&#8217;t sign a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/bed-bug-addendum-tenant-rights-responsibilities-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bed bugs addendum</a> unless they’re certain of the absence of these pests. The addendum comes with rules such as agreements regarding pest control fees, attorney fees, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="21-6-post-the-required-signs-and-notices">6. Post the required signs and notices</h3>



<p>Landlords need to inform the tenants of important circumstances by posting signs and notices in the buildings. Some of them include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fire safety notices</li>
</ul>



<p>Apartment building owners of more than 3 units are obligated to post an Emergency Preparedness Notice inside every rented unit. They should be posted on the entrance doors and in the lobby or common area.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Garbage collection notice</li>
</ul>



<p>A tamper-proof sign with the hours and method of garbage collection clearly stated should be posted in the lobby. If the building has a 24-hour dumbwaiter service, this isn’t necessary.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Certificate of inspection visits</li>
</ul>



<p>Landlords are to provide a 6″ x 9” frame issued by the Housing Preservation &amp; Development (HPD) inspector who visits the property. If a mailbox is present, the notice should be posted near the box between 48″ and 62″ above floor height.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Gas leak notice</li>
</ul>



<p>Property managers and landlords should provide tenants with a notice that properly spells out the procedures to follow in case of a suspected gas leak.</p>



<p>Gas leak notices are to be delivered to every tenant and prospective tenant with lease and lease renewal forms. They should also be posted in a common area.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="22-7-preparing-a-legal-written-lease-or-rental-agreement">7. Preparing a legal written lease or rental agreement</h3>



<p>The rental agreement or lease that a landlord and tenant sign sets the basis for their relationship and interactions. Important details, including the lease duration, amount of rent, or even what to do when a tenant decides on <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/breaking-a-lease-before-moving-in/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking a lease before moving in</a> should be spelled out.</p>



<p>Under federal, state, and local landlord-tenant laws, a lease provides all the legal rules that a landlord and tenant must follow. Any illegal clauses or waivers on the lease can lead to problems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="23-8-responsible-for-the-public-safety-of-tenants">8. Responsible for the public safety of tenants</h3>



<p>Landlords must provide basic safety. This includes locks on doors, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-security-system/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">apartment security systems</a>, and working intercoms. Public safety should also be given high priority, in the form of:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lead paint:</strong> Property owners are to investigate and get rid of lead-based paint hazards in their rental units.</li>



<li><strong>Smoke detectors:</strong> Smoke detectors and at least one approved carbon monoxide detector should be installed in each unit. These should be installed within 15 feet of the primary entrance to each bedroom. However, tenants are responsible for the maintenance of these detectors.</li>



<li><strong>Window guard</strong>s: For buildings with three or more apartments, NYC requires that approved window guards be installed on all windows, including first-floor bathrooms, windows leading to a terrace or balcony, in common areas, and in units occupied by children who are 10 years of age or younger.</li>



<li><strong>Outlet covers</strong>: In the public areas of apartment buildings with 3 or more units, electrical outlets should have outlet covers, caps, or other safety devices over the openings.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="24-9-comply-with-state-rent-rules">9. Comply with state rent rules</h3>



<p>If landlords want to raise rent prices or evict a tenant who hasn’t paid rent, they need to follow the specific <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/new-york-termination-nonpayment-rent-other-rent-rules.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">state rules</a> in NYC.</p>

<p>In New York, it’s illegal for a landlord to evict a tenant through any&nbsp;means except by obtaining a court order from a judge. There are correct and standard <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-eviction-process-new-york-rules-landlords-property-managers.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">procedures</a> set down for legal eviction of tenants.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="26-11-heat-and-hot-water">11. Heat and Hot Water</h3>



<p>NYC landlords are legally obligated to provide a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/renters-rights-landlord-provide-hot-water/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenant’s right regarding hot water</a>. Hot water should be available all year round, at a constant temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat should also be dutifully provided throughout the winter season, from the period of October 1st to May 31st.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="27-what-happens-when-you%E2%80%99re-denied-these-rights">What happens when you’re denied these rights?</h2>



<p>Housing complaints in NYC are filed according to the rental units.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Private buildings</strong>: If you’re living in a private building, you can make anonymous complaints about maintenance problems at any time. However, this is only if the complaint is affecting the whole building. You can file this complaint by dialing 311 or using NYC’s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Online Form for Maintenance Complaints</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Rent-stabilized apartments</strong>: Renters who stay in rent-stabilized apartments feel their rights aren’t being met can direct their complaints to the Department of Home and Community Renewal at 718-739-6400.</li>



<li><strong>Public housing</strong>: Public housing tenants can contact the NYCHA Section 8 hotline at 718-707-7771. Another option is using their online form: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/residents/customer-contact-center.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYCHA Customer Contact Center</a>.</li>
</ol>



<p>To address maintenance complaints, you can take the following steps:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The NYC Dept. of Housing Preservation &amp; Development (HPD) provides a guide to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tenants’ Rights and Responsibilities</a>. You can even <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/report-a-maintenance-issue.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file a Complaint with HPD</a>; HPD in turn can fine your landlord or order him to make the repairs. The process may take time if the problem isn’t urgent.</li>



<li>If very necessary, you can make the repair yourself and deduct the cost from your rent. Keep in mind that this may result in a lawsuit for non-payment of rent, so ensure you have good reasons.</li>



<li>If you live in a rent-stabilized apartment, file a complaint about “decreased services” with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.nyshcr.org/AboutUs/ContactUs.htm#rent-admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)</a>, which administers state rent laws.</li>



<li>If the maintenance problems are very serious, you can file an HP Action in Housing Court by visiting the clerk&#8217;s office in the Civil Court. The clerk will then help you file the necessary paperwork and schedule an apartment inspection by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (“HPD”).</li>

<p>Just a few days left before we bid goodbye to 2021, and what’s more exciting than the end of the year? A fresh start to literally everything! From changing your perspective to building a new you— dropping habits you don’t like and picking ones that will feed your soul. With that being said, the first place to start work on the <strong>‘new year, new me’ is with your home.</strong> If improving your home isn’t already one of your New Year’s resolutions, keep reading to find out why it should be!</p>



<p><strong>HOME IMPROVEMENT IDEAS FOR THE NEW YEAR</strong></p>



<p>Now is the time to declutter, organize and transform your apartment into a beautiful sanctuary you can call home. And, friends, we are here to help you keep your new year’s resolution with these easy home improvement ideas and DIY apartment hacks that will blow your mind! Let’s get started with the first very important one ??</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-declutter">1. <strong>DECLUTTER</strong></h2>



<p>Step one: DECLUTTER (and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/decluttering-101-to-be-or-not-to-be-messy/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make our mothers proud</a>). By going through your belongings, you’ll be able to decide which things to hold on to and which to toss. Set aside a day (or two!) to go through your clothes, appliances, and tools. Make a pile of things to donate, things to keep, and things to throw away. Don’t stop there, go through the rest of the apartment. Is there anything you can gift or donate? Once you’ve finished, go through the fridge and pantry and tackle that expired food.</p>



<p>While you’re decluttering your physical space, it’s also a great time to declutter your mental and financial areas. Reevaluate your subscriptions. Everyone loves Netflix, but how often are you reading that print magazine subscription? Do you really need everything in your beauty box, or have you found your favorite products by now? Be wise about the things you decide to spend your hard-earned money on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-deep-clean">2. <strong>DEEP CLEAN</strong></h2>

<p>When you’re done with the sorting phase, do a deep clean. Sweep and mop the floors, wash the dishes, wipe down the counters and dust surfaces, wash the windows, the whole nine yards. When your apartment is free of superfluous items, you can make better decisions about what you want the vibe of your place to be and how to respect that direction in the coming year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-create-creative-space-solutions">3. <strong>CREATE CREATIVE SPACE SOLUTIONS</strong></h2>



<p>We ALL need more storage than we’re currently getting. For you, this could be as simple as two under-the-bed rolling bins. If you really need much more space, consider renting a small storage unit for the things you don’t use regularly. You can also consider apartment hacks like using magnetic storage, getting multi-purpose furniture, and using vertical solutions to maximize space. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/diy-closet-organizer-hacks-to-take-your-closet-from-0-to-100/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1640870647814165&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FNRJRXjj_zAqP2Qxb6m9C">limited-space solutions</a> just waiting to be utilized.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-check-in">4. <strong>CHECK-IN</strong></h2>



<p>The next big step in preparing your apartment for 2022 is to verify that everything works. This means double-checking your heating and air conditioning, servicing your large appliances, and checking/changing batteries (think smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, roku remotes, back-up flashlights). This includes running a routine cleaning on your washing machine, dishwasher, and oven. This is also a great time to re-up on renter’s insurance. Make sure all of your most precious belongings are covered by your policy and claim any damages or repairs that need to be done.</p>

<p>Now we’re getting to the fun part! Once you’ve finished the necessary evils, you can bring your design vision to life. If you haven’t already done this, New Year is a great opportunity to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/the-greatest-design-hacks-for-your-small-apartment/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make your apartment your personal urban sanctuary</a>. Here you can spend as much or as little time and money as you’d like.</p>



<p>You can invest in a great new work of art to hang. Find cost-effective prints online, create your <a href="https://www.printful.com/blog/poster-ideas" class="broken_link">own poster designs</a>, or support your community by buying from a local artist<strong>.</strong> Create an accent wall with paint or professional wallpaper <a href="https://paintboise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">painting contractors</a>. Add new peel-and-stick floors or wall tiles to liven up your space. Apply contact paper to your countertops. Find second-hand furniture to do a DIY flip. The options are endless.</p>



<p>If none—or all—of this is up to your alley, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/tips-on-how-to-brighten-up-your-apartment-with-plants/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1640870647816343&amp;usg=AOvVaw0B3n83C4cLgBzH-RrDq_As">plants</a> are another inexpensive way to give your home that inviting touch. Buying from a nursery is great, but propagating plants can be just as satisfying. If you have friends with apartments giving jungle vibes, we suggest asking them. You can take cuttings to begin your own little plant family. Chances are they’ll be excited to share. You can find ones that need very little attention and add a great deal of visual interest to your space.</p>



<p>If nothing else, the simplest, cheapest, and easiest refresh can come from rearranging furniture. Work with what you have. Restyle your room or DIY upgrade your existing pieces. Another way to reduce costs is by splitting them. If you have a roommate, ask them if they’re interested in taking on the projects together to divide the cost and workload.

<p>Lastly, the best gift you can give yourself in 2022 is to create new and lasting routines. You know yourself better than anyone else. Whether you’re a Type-A organizer or you prefer to go with the flow, you can benefit from some basic routine advice. Put your bills and other essential payments on autopay. Staying on top of financial commitments can really help alleviate anxiety and unnecessary stress.</p>



<p>Create a daily, weekly, and monthly cleaning schedule. Do you prefer to go to bed with the sink empty, or is the morning when you feel most inspired to take on daily housework? Decide what your cleanliness priorities are and give yourself a window of time to dedicate to each one. And once a month—for the love of all things good—deep clean your apartment. This will keep the yearly review short and sweet.</p>



<p>The New Year doesn’t have to be a big and daunting event. While entirely remodeling your apartment might not be possible, you can set yourself up for success by attempting some of these DIY home improvement ideas. Try adding at least two of these apartment hacks into your 2022 New Year’s resolutions, and let us know in the comments if you have other tips!</p>

<p>When you are looking for small, budget-friendly apartments, it&#8217;s easy to get confused by all the different terminologies. For example, &#8220;efficiency apartments&#8221; and &#8220;studio apartments&#8221; &#8211; aren&#8217;t those the same thing? Well, no. Studio apartments and efficiency apartments are very similar, but there are some key differences between the two of them. Today, we are going to answer the question of, what is an efficiency apartment? To help you decide whether an efficiency apartment could work for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-an-efficiency-apartment"><strong>What is an Efficiency Apartment?</strong></h2>



<p>An efficiency apartment is a small apartment, usually between 300-500 square feet. The amenities are contained in a single room, where you can eat, sleep, cook, and clink beers with your friends. Generally, these apartments are well-suited for single folks.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" data-attachment-id="18923" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment/attachment/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="what-is-an-efficiency-apartment" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?resize=800%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="what-is-an-efficiency-apartment" class="wp-image-18923" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/what-is-an-efficiency-apartment.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="differences-between-efficiency-apartment-and-studio-apartment"><strong>Differences Between Efficiency Apartment and Studio Apartment</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most common questions asked by new renters is, &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between a studio apartment and an efficiency apartment?&#8221; Both types of apartments are small living spaces with more or less the same structure.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:100%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/FcuiZUneg1YRAu1lH2" title="headache"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p><strong>But even though both the spaces are contained in one room, they have these key differences:</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-kitchen"><strong>1. Kitchen</strong></h3>



<p>While both studio apartments and efficiency apartments have a main living area, their layouts are different. Studios have a full-sized kitchen in the main space, plus a bathroom in a separate room. On the other hand, efficiency apartments have a kitchenette (a smaller version of a kitchen). So, if you&#8217;re a born chef who likes to knock around in the kitchen, you might be better off in a studio!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-location">2. <strong>Location</strong></h3>



<p>If you going to be renting an apartment in a highly desirable part of the city, then you should choose an efficiency apartment. Often, these apartments are closer to centralized locations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-size"><strong>3. Size</strong></h3>



<p>When we compare the size of efficiency apartments and studios, efficiency apartments are usually smaller. Both are under 500 square feet, but efficiency apartments can be as small as 300 square feet.</p>



<p>If you are planning on renting an apartment with a roommate or a partner, then neither of these apartments are suitable for you. Both efficiency apartments and studio apartments are small living spaces, and living with an extra person can make the space feel even more cramped.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-cost"><strong>4. Cost</strong></h3>



<p>Less space usually means an apartment will cost less. But this is not true in the case of efficiency apartments. They tend to be located in upscale urban areas, whereas studio apartments are located in more rundown part of town. Thus, efficiency apartments are generally more expensive to rent than studio apartments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-and-cons-of-living-in-an-efficiency-apartment"><strong>Pros And Cons Of Living In An Efficiency Apartment</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros">Pros</h3>



<p>Well, now that you are acquainted with both kinds of spaces, we&#8217;d like to draw your attention to the benefits of living in an efficiency apartment. There are lots of benefits to living in an efficiency apartment, don&#8217;t let the small space make you think otherwise. Take a look at just a couple of them here:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>It saves you money, so that you can invest a little more in your future.</li><li>Cleaning your apartment is so much easier.</li><li>You have access to multifamily apartment amenities like a swimming pool, gym, community clubhouse, etc. So, there&#8217;s no chance of missing out on any kind of fun!</li><li>Easy access to the city&#8217;s hustle and bustle &#8211; and proximity to your favourite places, of course!</li><li>Utilities will cost you less. A smaller home means less space to heat in the winter and cool in summer.</li></ul>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cons">Cons</h3>



<p>While there are various advantages to living in an efficiency apartment, there are also a few things you might have to compromise on:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If you love to cook or invite your friends over for a low-key Sunday dinner, an efficiency apart will not be big enough for you. These apartments do not have a full-sized kitchen.</li><li>Likewise, if you are someone who loves to hang out with your friends, family, or partner at home, an efficiency apartment will not offer you enough space.</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="when-do-you-want-an-efficiency-apartment"><strong>When Do You Want An Efficiency Apartment?</strong></h2>



<p>Think about all the pros and cons of living in a small space like an efficiency apartment. Can you compromise on the square footage? What are your priorities when it comes to choosing an apartment?</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re single and/or not home a lot because of work, but you still want access to all the amenities, an efficiency apartment would be perfect for you. Likewise, if you live out of town but need somewhere to stay during the week because of your job, browse listings for efficiency apartments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-and-how-to-find-efficiency-apartments"><strong>Where And How To Find Efficiency Apartments?</strong></h2>



<p>Most efficiency apartments can be found in cities, where unit sizes are typically smaller. If you are a new renter in an unfamiliar city, you may need some help in finding one. You could try:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Looking online</li><li>Hiring a real estate agent</li><li>Searching for communities in your area</li><li>Using a roomfinder app like <a href="http://roomiapp.com">Roomi</a></li></ul>
