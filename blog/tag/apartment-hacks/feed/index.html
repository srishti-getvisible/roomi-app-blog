<p>Thinking of going on a short vacation, but don&#8217;t want to keep paying rent while you&#8217;re not staying in the apartment? Subletting is the solution for you. To sublet means to rent out a room that&#8217;s already being rented for a short period of time. It&#8217;s a great idea to ensure your rent is paid and your room is still intact when you return. However, it&#8217;s important to do your research about NYC subletting laws before starting anything.</p>



<p>Remember that there are terms and conditions, and the rights to sublet involved in the process before you make money subletting. It isn’t as simple as saying ‘I want to sublet my room’ to a friend who pays your rent for you.</p>



<p>In fact, in some states, you can go to prison if you’re found subletting your room without getting your landlord’s approval! Make sure you’re following the rules and know all about the laws for subletting in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-things-to-know-before-subletting">5 Things to Know Before Subletting</h2>



<p>New Yorkers, if you’re thinking of subletting your room, you have more flexibility than other renters across America! It’s the only other jurisdiction (alongside <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/lifestyle/things-to-know-when-moving-to-chicago-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Chicago</a>) where subletting your room is allowed. That too, even if your landlord denies or ignores your request. But there are laws in place and some restrictions in subletting. Here are five things you need to know about NYC subletting laws:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-confirm-if-you-re-able-to-sublet-in-your-apartment">#1: Confirm if you&#8217;re able to sublet in your apartment</h3>



<p>Although subletting is legal in New York, there are restrictions in place for certain types of apartments. If you fall under&nbsp;any of the following categories, you&nbsp;may not&nbsp;have the right to sublet your room. So make sure you get permission from the relevant body in writing before starting to make money subletting:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Public housing residents or those who receive rent subsidies don&#8217;t have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Tenants that live in non-profit buildings don&#8217;t have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Tenants in co-op and condo apartments should consult their proprietary lease. Also check the building’s by-laws, as they may not have the right to sublet.</li>



<li>Rent-stabilized tenants can sublet with a few restrictions: 1.) You have to maintain the apartment as your primary residence; 2.) You can&#8217;t charge more than the asking rent; 3.) You can&#8217;t sublet for more than 2 years.</li>



<li>Rent-controlled tenants don&#8217;t have the right to sublet by law and should check the clauses of their lease.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-let-your-landlord-know-through-writing">#2: Let your landlord know through writing</h3>



<p>The first step to subletting your apartment is to let your landlord know your plans to sublet 30 days before. You have to submit the following information by certified mail, return receipt requested:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The term and reason for subletting</li>



<li>The name of the person you’re subletting your room to</li>



<li>The business and permanent home address of the person subletting</li>



<li>Your address for the term of the sublet</li>



<li>Written consent from co-tenants or guarantor on the lease</li>



<li>A copy of the proposed sublease acknowledged by the main tenant and subtenant</li>
</ul>

<p>Your landlord has 10 days to ask for additional information, as long as it&#8217;s within reason. Then, if they fail to notify you whether they approve or reject your request within 30 days of your submission, it&#8217;s considered consent to sublet. However,&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">your landlord</a>&nbsp;can withhold the request if they have a good reason. As a result, you won’t be permitted to sublet your room by law. In circumstances where the landlord unreasonably withholds consent, you can go ahead with subletting your room anyway.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3: Subletting means you have to return to your apartment</h3>



<p>For subletting your room legally, you must plan on returning to the property once the term for subletting your room is up. If you think you’ll be gone for longer, speak to your landlord about breaking or re-assigning your lease to determine what the process should be.</p>



<p>As mentioned, you must have plans to return to the property after the term of subletting your room is over. But what happens when everything is going swimmingly? And you don’t want to go back to the room, and the new tenant has settled in? Can they take over your lease as per the right to sublet? Yes, they can.</p>



<p>Under NYC subletting laws, you must obtain written consent from the owner before proceeding. The owner is under no obligation to give their consent, nor do they have to provide a reason for denying the lease takeover.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4: Be aware of legal issues surrounding subletting</h3>



<p>If your landlord declines your request, and you still let another person sublet your room, there&#8217;s a high chance that you&#8217;ll be evicted for lease violations depending on your lease. With NYC subletting laws, certain legal issues could easily be avoided as long as you&#8217;re careful in planning and have everything in writing.</p>

<p>If your landlord rejects your request and you still proceed to sublet your room, you may face eviction. A case can be filed and if you lose, you can still keep the apartment by having the subtenant (the person subletting) move out within 10 days of the judgment. Either way, you&#8217;ll probably still pay your landlord&#8217;s attorney&#8217;s fees if your lease has an attorney&#8217;s fees clause. So, make sure to check and review your lease well.</p>



<p>One thing to consider is if you can actually make money while subletting, and the simple answer is yes, you can, with a few limitations. The right to sublet allows adding an extra 10% of the monthly rent onto the price when subletting your room. But only as long as the place is furnished. Your landlord also has the right to “sublet allowance,&#8221; another 10% of the monthly rent.</p>



<p>So as per NYC subletting laws, you can rent the room at 20% more than you pay. If you’re adding on more and the new tenant finds out, they can file a complaint and you’d have to pay a heavy fine.&nbsp;But if you&#8217;re in a rent-stabilized apartment, you can&#8217;t charge more than your current rent. <a href="https://hcr.ny.gov/office-rent-administration-ora#contact-ora" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR)</a>&nbsp;is the state agency that governs this and contains up-to-date information regarding the latest updates to the right to sublet.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also the issue of illusory sublets where the main tenant hasn&#8217;t been in the apartment, meaning it isn&#8217;t their primary residence violating NYC subletting laws. A complaint can be filed by the cotentant which will require the owner to recognize the subtenant as the actual tenant who can renew their lease.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5: You can use an online tool to help sublet your room</h3>



<p>You can use an online room and roommate finder tool, like Roomi, to help streamline your subletting process. Roomi is a trusted online platform with listings and verified users around the globe.

Though most people love an apartment with a view, they may not fit with your apartment and lifestyle. So, let&#8217;s look at the pros and cons between the two and determine which one is best for you!</p>

<p>Imagine a flight of 200 stairs and a building with 10 stories. That&#8217;s what a high-rise building looked like in ancient Rome. Luckily, they now come with elevators to make going up and down easier.</p>



<p>The difference between a high-rise and low-rise apartment is in their height. If it&#8217;s at least 7 stories tall, it&#8217;s a high-rise apartment. Otherwise, it is a low-rise apartment. High-rise apartments can also go as high as 20-30 stories, and give that feeling of being above the world, and beyond the anyone&#8217;s reach.</p>

<p>While each has its perks over the other, your eventual choice will depend on personal preference. Let&#8217;s take a look at the pros and cons of high-rise vs low-rise apartments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-of-high-rise-apartments"><strong>Pros of High-Rise Apartments</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Stunning views</strong></p>



<p>High-rise apartments offer stunning views of any city, allowing you to see far and wide and with the radiance of natural light. It’s the kind of scenery that‘ll leave an impression on you every time.</p>



<p><strong>Additional security</strong></p>



<p>Most high-rise buildings come with a doorman, security, and other staff, which can make living in the apartment easier and safer.</p>



<p><strong>More Lease Options</strong></p>



<p>You’re more likely to find a lease in a high-rise apartment than you would in a low-rise. So if you&#8217;re looking to get settled quickly, an high-rise building is most likely where you&#8217;ll land.</p>



<p><strong>Easier to settle down</strong></p>



<p>Most high-rise apartments come with pre-installed utilities like cable, internet, and the like. This makes it easy to start enjoying your home once you move in.</p>



<p><strong>Quick maintenance fixes</strong></p>



<p>It’s also easy to get repairs and maintenance done because most high-rise apartments have an on-site property management office to handle such requests.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cons-of-high-rise-apartments"><strong>Cons of High-Rise Apartments</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>



<p>Often, high-rise apartments are more expensive because of their locations.</p>



<p><strong>Emergency</strong></p>



<p>In cases of emergency, living in a high-rise building will make getting to safety difficult compared to living in a low-rise apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-of-low-rise-apartments"><strong>Pros of Low-Rise Apartments</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Easy street access</strong></p>



<p>You’ll have quick access to the street level if you stay in a low-rise apartment. This is especially important if you live with an elderly or disabled person or in the event of an emergency.</p>



<p><strong>More amenities</strong></p>



<p>Low-rise apartments usually have more <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-amenities-when-renting-in-nyc/">amenities</a>, like pools, gardens, clubhouses, and more parking spaces. And all these amenities available with the apartment are relatively cheaper than those of a high-rise apartment.</p>



<p><strong>Peaceful location</strong></p>



<p>You’ll find low-rise apartments in peaceful, outer residential neighborhoods. Yes, it is often some distance from the city center meaning longer commute times However, it more than makes up for this setback with less traffic congestion, cleaner environments, and a greater sense of community.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cons-of-low-rise-apartments"><strong>Cons of Low-Rise Apartments</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Views</strong></p>



<p>The views from a low-rise apartment are often not as stunning as those from a high-rise condo.</p>



<p><strong>Congested spaces</strong></p>



<p>Shared corridors and hallways in low-rise apartments could lead to more congestion at busier times in the day. This may not be ideal if you like your privacy.</p>

<p>In deciding on what floor you want to live on, it’s important to remember that some of the pros of each apartment type may be lost depending on your floor. By this, we mean that the difference between a high-rise and low-rise apartment is influenced by the floor on which you stay. So there’s no single answer to this question. Rather, it must be decided on an apartment-by-apartment basis.</p>



<p>For example, living on a low level of a high-rise condo may give you as much access to the street as a low-rise apartment. Conversely, staying at the highest level of a low-rise apartment may offer you a better view of the city than the first floor of a high-rise building.</p>



<p>So which one is better between a high-rise vs low-rise apartment? This is a question you must ask and answer yourself based on your preferences and budget. Once you’ve decided, check out our (Roomi) collection of high-rise and low-rise rental apartments to find those that fit your budget.</p>

Both have a lot in common, with their own distinct advantages and downfalls. Let&#8217;s examine studio vs. 1-bedroom apartments so you can decide on the right choice for you.</p>

<p>A studio apartment is designed as a single large room with all you need in one living area. It combines the living room, bedroom, and dining area in open floor space (with no adjoining walls between). That is aside from your bathroom, which is &#8211; thankfully &#8211; in a separate room.</p>



<p>A studio is an amazing choice for someone who wants to live alone, likes open, airy space, and is looking to save some money off the rent. Additionally, studio apartments don&#8217;t need a lot of furniture to feel complete. This makes them pretty perfect for someone who is just starting life on their own.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a fun fact. While the studio is essentially an open space, the storage space inside it is limited. Okay, maybe it&#8217;s not so fun, but if you&#8217;re someone with many belongings, you should keep an eye out for studios with larger storage spaces that can take your things.</p>



<p>Also, studio apartments are not ideal for most couples, especially if you need some privacy now and again.</p>

<p>A 1-bedroom apartment is carved out by walls into smaller rooms. Your bedroom is a separate room, rather than having a bed in the living space. The kitchen may also be its own room, but some 1-bedroom apartments have an open-plan kitchen and living area.</p>



<p>Generally, 1-bedroom apartments are typically more spacious. Do you like to have friends over, need some privacy or just think you&#8217;d go stir-crazy with only one room in the home? A 1-bedroom apartment will be better than a studio apartment for you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-studio-vs-1-bedroom-apartment-any-difference">A Studio vs 1 Bedroom Apartment: Any Difference?</h2>



<p>First, in comparing a studio vs 1 bedroom apartment, a defining difference is that the 1-bedroom has a separate bedroom area that is closed off from the living area and kitchen. On the other hand, a studio apartment is a self-contained space that houses everything in a single large room.</p>

<p>Beyond the wall partitions and space cordoning, there are several factors to consider when comparing a studio vs 1 bedroom apartment. Let&#8217;s break down all the important stuff.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: Getting a studio is cheaper than getting a 1-bedroom apartment because it has less space. You might find that a studio apartment helps you save a few hundred dollars, for a more manageable lifestyle.</li><li><strong>Utility bills</strong>: Again, more space means more utilities and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-amenities-when-renting-in-nyc/">amenities</a>. More utilities mean more bills for heating, lights, more electrical outlets, etc. You’re likely to incur more utility bills if you decide to stay in a 1-bedroom apartment instead of a studio.</li><li><strong>Cleaning and Decorating</strong>: It’s always going to be easier to clean an apartment with a smaller space. The same goes with decorating as there’ll be fewer walls to fill up.</li><li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: If you like to be on your own or with one other person you’re very comfortable around, a studio apartment might be enough. But if you like to have friends over for dinner, you may need a larger space, making a 1-bedroom apartment a better option.</li><li><strong>Occupancy</strong>: When more than one person occupies a studio apartment, it can feel cramped. A 1-bedroom apartment offers more in terms of space (both storage and general) and comfort for people.</li><li><strong>Remote work</strong>: If you work from home, you&#8217;ll probably find a studio apartment just doesn&#8217;t cut it. It&#8217;s not ideal to eat, sleep, work and relax in the same room every day. Especially when you have to do it all from your bed. Alternatively, a 1-bedroom apartment allows you room to move around and catch your breath.</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Whatever option you choose between the studio and a one-bedroom apartment, the location will affect the price. Even though studios are generally cheaper, you&#8217;ll save money on a one-bedroom apartment if you move away from the action.</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-right-for-you">So Which is Right for You?</h2>



<p>There’s no straight answer to this question. Whether you choose a studio apartment or a 1-bedroom apartment depends on what matters to you. Weigh up your personal preferences, budget and living expectations. Then, you can decide on which of the spaces fits your needs.</p>



<p>Whatever your preference is, the earlier you start your search, the better. Ready to find that suitable studio apartment or one-bedroom in minutes? Let <a href="http://roomiapp.com">Roomi</a> help you.</p>

<p>Metal keys are the most common type of key which is still used in apartments. These are the battle-tested keys that stay loyal to you no matter what. You can toss them, drop them, lose them, but they never lose their shape. These keys are generally low-cost and long-lasting.</p>



<p>These types of apartment keys are designed with distinctive cuts and grooves to fit into their corresponding doors.</p>



<p>But, here&#8217;s the kick! Before you make a copy to protect against any missing key disasters, check with your landlord first. Does your lease allow you to make copies? Make sure you get the go ahead before visiting the hardware store.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-cards"><strong>Key Cards</strong></h3>



<p>These apartment keys are jeans-friendly, wallet-sized plastic cards that let you unlock doors effortlessly.</p>



<p>These keys grant you access through electrically powered doors with just a tap or a swipe. The embedded credentials on the keycard magstripe (magnetic stripe) are read by the keycard reader every time you attempt to unlock a door.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-fobs"><strong>Key Fobs</strong></h3>



<p>These types of apartment keys are just like keycards, but smaller. The fobs are clipped to your keyring. The keys are small and also use a tiny induction circuit, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about changing batteries.</p>



<p>The downside to this type of apartment key is that they are expensive to replace. So if you&#8217;re someone who loses things all the time, this probably isn&#8217;t right for you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="keyless-entry"><strong>Keyless Entry</strong></h3>



<p>Sometimes your key is invisible! In other words, you unlock doors using codes or punch-ins.</p>



<p>Lots of modern building apartments today use this type of key. You simply punch in the code to unlock your unit. In most cases, you&#8217;ll be allowed to choose your own code &#8211; make sure it&#8217;s memorable, and don&#8217;t give it out to anyone!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-if-you-lose-your-apartment-keys"><strong>WHAT IF YOU LOSE YOUR APARTMENT KEYS?</strong></h2>



<p>Imagine you reach home, slip your hand inside your pocket and your apartment key is missing! Frustrating right? Don&#8217;t panic &#8211; you&#8217;ll soon find a solution and be back inside in no time.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="stay-calm-and-don-t-break-into-your-own-house"><strong>Stay calm and don&#8217;t break into your own house</strong></h3>



<p>Losing your key is panicky and upsetting, but try not to get stressed. First things first, never attempt to break into your own house no matter how stressful it gets. An attempt to break into your property can cause damage, and this could be more expensive than calling the locksmith.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-quick-flashback">A quick flashback</h3>



<p>See if you can find your key by tracing back your steps to your last location. There&#8217;s a possibility that you might have dropped the key or left it somewhere.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="contact-whoever-you-are-living-with">Contact whoever you are living with</h3>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have a spare key, give your roommate a call. If you&#8217;re lucky, they might be home or hanging out nearby, and can come to let you in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="reach-out-to-your-landlord-management">Reach out to your landlord/management</h3>



<p>If you can make it to the leasing office, the staff there should be able to resolve things. You can usually contact them during business hours. If the loss happened during non-business hours and you can&#8217;t wait until the next morning, then you will have to find another solution.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="contact-a-locksmith">Contact a locksmith</h3>



<p>This should be your last resort. When you have tried everything, you can contact a locksmith who can let you in and fix you with a new lock and key. This approach might take a little while and will incur some costs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-guidelines-for-every-new-renter"><strong>KEY GUIDELINES FOR EVERY NEW RENTER</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-much-will-key-replacement-cost"><strong>How Much Will Key Replacement Cost?</strong></h3>



<p>The cost of key replacement depends on the type of door lock. The cost may also vary according to the location and the time of day or night. A locksmith is likely to charge more for a call at night.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-about-key-duplication">What About <strong>Key Duplication?</strong></h3>



<p>You never know when your key will magically disappear! Having a duplicate key can be your saving grace if you&#8217;re prone to losing your things. We don&#8217;t recommend keeping this spare key at home. Leave your apartment key with a trusted friend or family member.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-insurance"><strong>Key Insurance</strong></h3>



<p>If you have a home insurance policy, call your provider to check if it includes key insurance too. If you have key insurance included in your policy, you can relax in the knowledge that your provider will cover any key replacement costs.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="some-dos-and-don-ts"><strong>SOME DOS AND DON&#8217;TS</strong></h1>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-dos"><strong>The Dos</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"><li><strong>Get creative</strong></li></ol>



<p>Lockouts happen, and a spare key could help save a call to the locksmith in the middle of the night.</p>



<p>You can dig out a spot in your walkway, or secure it in bird feeders, grills, or deep in the garden. Intruders know where to look, so divert their attention by choosing a unique spot for hiding your apartment keys.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"><li><strong>A friend is all you need!</strong></li></ol>



<p>If your neighbors are people you can rely on, give them your extra key. This way, you can grab your apartment key quickly from your neighbors when a disaster strikes.</p>



<p>You could also switch hiding spots: stash your neighbor&#8217;s key at your place, and yours at their place.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-don-ts"><strong>The Don&#8217;ts</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"><li><strong>Place them near the door</strong></li></ol>



<p>Never put your apartment key in obvious places like under the doormat. In fact, putting it anywhere near the door is a no-no, as this is the first place intruders would look.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"><li><strong>Use easy giveaways</strong></li></ol>



<p>You probably don&#8217;t want to give obvious hints to intruders about your keys. Use your common sense, here. A fake rock on your front porch practically shouts &#8220;Keys are here!&#8221;&#8230;so don&#8217;t do that.</p>

<p>Apartment-hunting is not an easy task, but knowing which kind you want of the many types of apartments can make your experience much easier. How many bedrooms do you need? How about a backyard space? Or maybe a shared living space? There are many things to consider! So, don&#8217;t forget to factor in everything you need while knowing more about these 10 different types of apartments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-studio">1. Studio</h3>



<p>A studio is one of the most common apartment styles since it only consists of one room. It has an open floor plan with the bedroom, living room, and kitchen in one space. A studio is one of the most common apartment styles since it only consists of one room. It has an open floor plan with the bedroom, living room, and kitchen in one space. For those looking to personalize their space, using an <a href="https://www.canva.com/create/floor-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">online floor plan maker</a> can help devise the perfect layout fitting individual needs.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Alcove Studio:</strong> An alcove studio is a variation of the regular studio, but with an L partition in the living room. This creates a more private space and is a perfect nook for a bed or a desk.</li>



<li><strong>Convertible Studio and Apartment:</strong> From the name itself, a convertible studio is a different type of studio with more space. This apartment-style is big enough to construct a wall to create a bedroom. On the other hand, there&#8217;s enough space to make a secondary room in a convertible apartment. In general, a convertible apartment can have two bedrooms, while the studio can only have one bedroom.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-micro-apartment">2. Micro Apartment</h3>



<p>Similar to a studio, a micro-apartment has one room that&#8217;s only around 350 square feet. This type of apartment has space for sleeping, sitting, a small bathroom, and a kitchenette. Usually, micro-units have flexible furniture like a foldable bed or kitchen table to maximize space.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-junior-1-bedroom">3. Junior 1-Bedroom</h3>



<p>In simple terms, a junior 1-bedroom is a medium-sized apartment. It differs from a studio with its size and separated bedroom from the living area. Of all the types of apartments, this apartment-style is simple and has enough space for most!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-loft">4. Loft</h3>



<p>A loft is a type of apartment with a high ceiling. It&#8217;s one large room with big windows and a full sleeping and kitchen area. These types of apartment styles are similar to studios and are usually converted into residential spaces from historic warehouses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-duplex-and-triplex">5. Duplex and Triplex</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for shared living spaces but with your own privacy, a duplex or a triplex could be the apartment style for you. Plus, these types of apartments are perfect for families or a group of friends.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Duplex</strong>: A duplex typically has two separate units with their own entrances. It can be side-by-side or with a second level.</li>



<li><strong>Triplex</strong>: Similarly, a triplex has three units rather than two. It also has three separate entrances, but the size of the units are usually the same.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-garden-apartment">6. Garden Apartment</h3>



<p>This type of apartment is on the ground floor with direct access to a backyard or garden area. A garden apartment is normally in a smaller apartment community that&#8217;s surrounded by garden space.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-railroad-apartment">7. Railroad Apartment</h3>



<p>Often found in smaller and older buildings, a railroad apartment is less common in all apartment styles. It consists of three or four rooms connected without a hallway, forming a thin rectangle and resembling a train passenger car.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-walk-up-apartment">8. Walk-up Apartment</h3>



<p>A walk-up is a type of apartment where you have to use stairs to access the building. Buildings with a walk-up apartment are small and normally don&#8217;t have elevators. So, there are fewer tenants in this apartment-style.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-co-op-apartment">9. Co-Op Apartment</h3>



<p>Called a housing cooperative (&#8220;co-op&#8221;), this is a housing community where a group of people owns a property together. With shared living spaces, everyone can live in the property as long as they share in paying for it!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-penthouse">10. Penthouse</h3>



<p>Lastly, a penthouse is an apartment on the top-most floor of a building. It&#8217;s the most luxurious, among all types of apartments, typically large in size. Some even have a private elevator to reach the unit. Often, a penthouse features an outstanding view of the city and is expensive.</p>

<p>Before anything, it&#8217;s important to understand what a lease agreement is and what it means. Essentially, when signing the document, both you and your landlord agree to fulfill certain responsibilities. This typically includes details of what your landlord will provide, when your rent should be paid, and any house rules.</p>



<p>You might feel you can still back out of the lease if you haven&#8217;t moved in yet. But the reality is that when you&#8217;re breaking a lease before moving in, you&#8217;re actually violating a legally binding document. Because you signed the contract, you agreed to be subject to the lease&#8217;s terms, conditions, and financial obligations.</p>



<p>Some tenants might try to invoke their &#8220;right to rescind,&#8221; but this doesn&#8217;t really apply when renting an apartment. This basically refers to a borrower&#8217;s right to cancel certain types of loans after three days. Also, there&#8217;s no 24-hour &#8220;cooling-off&#8221; policy that you can use to cancel the contract.</p>



<p>Check if your lease agreement contains a termination clause. It should have clearly defined guidelines on what you&#8217;re entitled to in case you want to cancel your lease before moving in. Your landlord might also ask you to submit a 30-day notice before you officially break the lease. This gives your landlord time to look for a new tenant to rent the space.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-can-you-expect-from-your-landlord-when-you-re-breaking-a-lease-before-moving-in">What can you expect from your landlord when you&#8217;re breaking a lease before moving in?</h2>



<p>First of all, both you and the landlord should refer back to the apartment lease agreement before taking action. This contract serves as a guide to what you&#8217;re supposed to do.</p>



<p>The landlord should properly explain what you are entitled to and what your legal obligations are. Most states insist that landlords make a good-faith effort to find a new tenant as soon as possible. This means that you, as the existing tenant, should continue paying your dues until the property is re-rented.</p>



<p>You might have a perfectly valid reason for needing to cancel your lease before moving in. It might be something entirely beyond your control. You may have lost your source of income or encountered a medical emergency, making it hard to pay rent. Unfortunately, in these cases, it&#8217;s still up to your landlord to decide whether to let you off the hook.</p>

<p>Once a new renter signs a lease agreement, your lease is no longer valid. Until that time, you&#8217;re expected to continue paying rent. Note that if you don&#8217;t pay your debt, your landlord could bring the matter to court.</p>



<p>Your landlord might have asked you to sign an early lease termination letter. This is basically an additional section or clause that&#8217;s added to a lease agreement. It also acts as your landlord&#8217;s memo of what you need to do and by when, since you&#8217;re breaking a lease before moving in.</p>



<p>This letter is a requirement in most states so that the termination of the lease becomes valid. It should include the reason behind needing to cancel your lease before moving in. This document should also list the fees you need to pay and how these will be collected. Without this letter, the issue could be brought to court. If it&#8217;s not required by the state, then your landlord might waive this requirement.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-about-the-security-deposit">What about the security deposit?</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ve probably thought about your security deposit, too. Before moving in, you paid this fee that&#8217;s usually equivalent to two or three months&#8217; rent. When breaking a lease, your security deposit can be used to pay for damages or repairs on the property. It can also be used for cleaning expenses, replacing keys, or for your back rent.</p>



<p>When breaking a lease before moving in, you need to follow standard protocol, like paying a fee or forfeiting your security deposit. This is all part of the process of terminating the lease early.</p>



<p>Until a new renter is found, your landlord can apply the security deposit to cover your rent. They can then give you anything left over once someone new moves in.</p>



<p>Your landlord could also collect your rent and give you back the deposit once a new renter is found. Since you didn&#8217;t occupy the apartment anyway, you should get it back in full. Your landlord should only tap into the security deposit if you fail to pay your rent.</p>

<p>Yes. When you fail to pay rent on top of breaking a lease, your landlord may be forced to take legal action. And if your landlord wins the case, a collection agency may take on the unpaid debt. Unless you pay up or come to a settlement, breaking a lease before moving in will impact your credit score.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-bottom-line"><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2>



<p>We hope this article has answered everything you need to know about breaking a lease before moving in. At the end of the day, nobody plans on intentionally breaking a lease after poring through endless listings for the perfect apartment. Whatever the reason, whether within or beyond your control, there are agreements in place for a reason.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Roomi comes with practical features to help add some wiggle room for tenants. If you need to <a href="https://roomiapp.com/policies/cancellation-policy" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">cancel your accommodation</a>, you&#8217;ll be entitled to a full or partial refund of your first rental payment minus any applicable service fees. Note that this will depend on the kind of cancellation policy that your landlord selected. While this policy doesn&#8217;t necessarily terminate your lease agreement, it does offer additional protection if you have a change of plans.</p>



<p>Want to learn more? You can read all about how each cancellation policy works by visiting the Roomi website. As a Roomi user, you can also make use of the built-in messaging feature on the app or site. Use it to ask your landlord any queries about your agreement before signing a lease.</p>

<p>In chilly winters, the fireplace becomes the central source of warmth and joy. And above the fireplace is the mantel, which should become the focal point of your small apartment. This is where your guests can gather to chat and sit around the fire. Add your favorite Christmas objects over the mantel, such as pine cones and stockings. Also, hang up elegantly framed pictures that evoke memories of Christmas past.</p>

<p>Why invest in a heavy, bulky Christmas tree when you can display smaller and cuter alternatives? Get a mini Christmas tree or use a branch of a full-size one. You can also opt for another potted plant or adorable micro trees. These are some of the best Christmas tree ideas for a small apartment. Downsizing your Christmas tree can save you a bunch of space in your apartment that can be used to arrange a seating area. Having some clear space makes the it feel larger and more organized.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-work-with-a-theme">4. Work with a theme</h3>



<p>Having a theme can work wonders for your small apartment Christmas decor. You can opt for a color scheme like black and white. Or you can be more specific with a motif of floral decorations or a fairytale setting. A vintage theme can work wonderfully to create a nostalgic and comforting space. Themes of a frozen wonderland or a mountain lodge can also work beautifully to get the best out of your small apartment.</p>

<p>For your small apartment Christmas decor, get some fresh bouquets or a new seasonal plant. Poinsettias are known to be a classic choice but you can also get orchids and cyclamens. Add some fir and pine cones for a wintry look. Dry flowers or winter bouquets with candy canes add the perfect amount of whimsy to your space.</p>

<p>Glam up your doors to add to your small apartment Christmas decor. You can hang a bell on the doorknob so that everyone greets with a holiday jingle. Hang some flowers or some pine branches with a cute bow. Or you may just stick a basket and add some pretty little things like pine cones or fresh poinsettias.</p>



<p>Make a unique wreath for your front door. If you have a theme for Christmas decor, you can design your wreath to match. For example, for a vintage theme, you can make a wreath of dry, old flowers with some fairy lights. You can stick several <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Making-Mini-Christmas-Wreaths/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">mini wreaths</a> on your door as well.</p>

<p>The kitchen is an important part of your apartment, so why leave it out of the celebration? It will most likely already be brewing with fragrances that will attract your guests. Make it visually appealing as well with cute bows and mini wreaths on the cupboard.</p>



<p>Get a mini Christmas tree or some pine cones to add to the charm. But make sure not to over-clutter the counter space. Your decorations should not prevent you from cooking in the kitchen.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re all scared of something. For some of us, it&#8217;s the dark; for others, it&#8217;s a surprise apartment inspection. A lot can go wrong if a rental inspection by the landlord doesn&#8217;t go well. That being said, this guide will cover what an apartment inspection is, and provide you with an extensive apartment inspection checklist. These inspections can be scary but don&#8217;t worry, Roomi&#8217;s got you covered!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-an-apartment-inspection">What is an apartment inspection?</h2>

<p>Typically, landlords, maintenance workers and property managers carry out an apartment inspection. It&#8217;s a routine check-up to make sure the apartment is in good shape and the tenant is not violating the agreements stated in the lease.</p>



<p>Apartment complex inspections can take place at different intervals, depending on the terms of your lease. On your lease, look for a clause entitled &#8220;Right to Entry&#8221;. This will tell you about how your landlord performs inspections.</p>



<p>Though landlords are legally allowed to inspect the property, they aren&#8217;t supposed to barge in without prior notice. Usually, they need to give a 24-48 hour notice, but this may vary depending on the lease terms or state laws. The landlord may also inform you that the inspection can take place whether you are home or not.</p>



<p>Typically, a landlord is not supposed to conduct &#8220;redundant and excessive inspections&#8221; . They may be violating the &#8216;Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment&#8217; clause on your lease which states that you are entitled to have your property undisturbed.</p>

<p>Most times, landlord property inspections aim to fish out any traces of lease violations. Landlords will check the features of both the exterior and interior of the apartment.</p>



<p>Tenants should point out any issue they may have about the apartment during inspections.</p>



<p>Apartment inspections can be nerve-racking, but if you prepare well beforehand, then everything will go smoothly. Here&#8217;s an apartment inspection checklist to guide you in the process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-exterior">1. Exterior</h3>



<p>Before checking the inside, the landlord will examine the state of the exterior part of the property. These may include doors, windows, garages, balconies, porches, locks, gutters, and roofs. Make sure to check:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The windows aren&#8217;t cracked or broken</li>



<li>The house doors close and lock</li>



<li>The gutters are clean</li>



<li>The garage doors are functioning well</li>



<li>The roof hasn&#8217;t been damaged by bad weather</li>



<li>The railings on the balconies are still strong</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-floors">2. Floors</h3>



<p>Having dirty floors and carpets will not work in your favor. Landlord: 1, You: 0. Be sure to take care of your floors by sweeping, mopping, and getting rid of carpet stains.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-electricity">3. Electricity</h3>



<p>Make sure that you take care of electrical objects in the home all year round. Electric issues won&#8217;t put you in your landlord&#8217;s good books during a rental inspection.</p>



<p>This is why it&#8217;s important to report things as soon as they break. Clean the HVAC and other appliances regularly to get rid of dust.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-appliances">4. Appliances</h3>



<p>Take good care of your appliances, especially the ones that were provided by the landlord. Keep your fridges, stove, microwave, and other appliances clean, and as usual, report any breakdowns.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-bathrooms">5. Bathrooms</h3>



<p>A thorough cleaning of your bathroom will help a great deal for an apartment complex inspection. None of us enjoy cleaning the bathroom, but it&#8217;s a sure-fire sign of a home that&#8217;s looked after.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-walls-and-ceilings">6. Walls and Ceilings</h3>



<p>Did you cover up some holes in the walls with picture frames? This doesn&#8217;t look great &#8211; especially if you eventually decide to move out.</p>



<p>Make an effort to patch up all the holes on your walls. Clean your ceilings by dusting them with brooms to get rid of dust, cobwebs, and debris.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-pets-damage-illegal-pets">7. Pets Damage/ Illegal Pets</h3>



<p>Before bringing your furry friends to live in your apartment, make sure the lease permits you to. It won&#8217;t be a good look for you if your landlord finds out you snuck a pet into the building.</p>



<p>However, if your lease does allow pets, then make sure to clean up any mess they may have made before the inspection.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-illegal-co-tenants">8. Illegal Co-tenants</h3>



<p>Another important part of this apartment inspection checklist is illegal co-tenants. Your landlord will not appreciate you violating the terms of your lease by allowing people to live in your apartment with you. You may have gotten away with it for some time, but it could cost you in the long run.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-furniture">9. Furniture</h3>



<p>If your apartment was furnished before you moved in, then you need to ensure that you keep everything in good shape. Examine the furniture in your apartment to make sure nothing is damaged or missing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-smoke-detector">10. Smoke Detector</h3>



<p>Every apartment should have a fully functional smoke detector, and you should check if the batteries need to be changed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-kitchen">11. Kitchen</h3>



<p>Let your kitchen be a shining example of hygiene during rental inspections. Make sure to clean all surfaces, and ensure that all kitchen appliances like the oven, stove, refrigerator and dishwashers are working well.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. It&#8217;s important that you leave no stone unturned while preparing for an inspection. We also recommend you conduct regular and thorough apartment cleanings so that a surprise inspection will not catch you off guard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There&#8217;s something magical about the fall, and Thanksgiving just adds to that warm and fuzzy feeling. Being able to share it with family and friends really is the icing on the cake. Unfortunately, people who live in small shared spaces often find that they&#8217;re constrained by space. They assume they couldn&#8217;t possibly hold Thanksgiving in a small apartment and so miss out on the opportunity to celebrate with people they love.</p>



<p>Contrary to popular assumption, living in a shared space doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t hold an ‘awemazing’ Thanksgiving dinner. There’s no need to panic. Instead, see hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment as a creative challenge that you CAN overcome! Here are a few tips and tricks on exactly what you need to transform your apartment into Shangri La and enjoy the magic of Thanksgiving with roommates, friends and family.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-plan-in-advance">1. Plan in advance</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/YoVxNJg9D6ejbbSCZ8" title="make a plan"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Ask yourself the hard questions when you start planning. How much space do I have? Do I have enough tables, chairs, cooking utensils? Would I need to get more? What are my alternatives for the things I don’t have? What can I ask others to bring along? As you answer these questions, a clearer picture of what you can and can&#8217;t do will begin to emerge. It&#8217;s an important first step if you&#8217;re going to successfully host Thanksgiving in a small apartment, so grab a pen and take your time with it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-talk-to-your-roommate-s">2. Talk to your roommate(s)</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/F6CnoyW0upKE0" title="talk"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If you share an apartment with a roommate, then talking to them is one of the first things to do when hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment. Sure, you may all have equal rights to shared spaces but the courtesy of telling your roommate guarantees you a helping hand, and prevents unnecessary arguments.</p>

<p>So, you&#8217;ve identified the number of people your apartment can hold. It&#8217;s time to invite those people and confirm if they&#8217;ll be showing up. You should also let them know there’ll be no room for plus ones. This tip helps you avoid surprises in the form of Tinder dates or great aunts when hosting Thanksgiving in your small apartment!</p>



<p>Based on who&#8217;s coming, you can now make decisions about Thanksgiving seating ideas. You may want to set a designated seat at the table for every guest. You may have people coming who don&#8217;t mind eating while sitting on the couch. The confirmed guest list helps you come up with some good Thanksgiving seating ideas.</p>

<p>A chilly season means you have to prepare for your guests&#8217; coats, hats and umbrellas. These can quickly clutter your small space. Designate somewhere in your apartment for people to drop their things. It could be a rolling garment rack you place in the hallway or some space in your closet, or in the worst case, your bed. It may not be the prettiest but it&#8217;ll declutter your living room and dining space and help you better enjoy Thanksgiving with your roommates.</p>

<p>People need tables to eat their Thanksgiving dinner &#8211; right? Chances are that you don&#8217;t have enough. So, you may want to borrow some folding tables to make up for it. Even if the tables don’t match after assembling them, you can get a Thanksgiving tablecloth to hide the mismatch and create some ambiance.</p>

<p>Your kitchen is about to explode with the not-so-nice smell of used dishes, which is why it&#8217;s best to wash as you go along. Consider organizing your dishes into courses so that the period in between courses can be used to quickly wash, dry, and put aside any dishes not in use. That&#8217;ll keep dishes away from valuable serving space. Just make sure you don&#8217;t spend the entire evening in the kitchen. You&#8217;re there to spend time with your loved ones, too!</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could choose to buy disposable dishware when hosting Thanksgiving in your small apartment. You likely don’t have enough space to take all the dishes you’ll need when hosting Thanksgiving in a small kitchen. Likewise, you can’t afford to leave them in your dining area or kitchen once the meal is done.</p>



<p>There is high-end disposable dishware that looks and feels like real china available. Consider getting some so you can easily throw them away as people finish their meals. Done and dusted.</p>

<p>You may need to move furniture, clutter, book stacks, or gadgets to create more space. Sometimes moving them to the wall will do. At other times, you may need to move some furniture to the bedroom temporarily.</p>



<p>Likewise, opening up the room with good lighting creates a sense of a larger space. Avoid cluttering the tables with decorative pieces. Instead, consider decorating the walls when hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment. You can also use candles arranged around the room for a warm glow.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be rigid with what you cook for Thanksgiving. It&#8217;s best to consider the space you have and make decisions based on that. For example, a turkey in the oven will force you to keep every other thing out leaving you with little room to cook anything else with the oven. Consider changing up your Thanksgiving dinner menu to use the space you do have in your kitchen.</p>



<p>Additionally, you can let your guests know what you&#8217;re cooking and turn Thanksgiving into a potluck, asking them to bring specific food items as they come. It’s also good to have a plan for dealing with leftovers when hosting Thanksgiving in a small apartment.</p>

<p>An exit plan for when everyone is done eating is always nice when hosting Thanksgiving in a small space. It could be that everyone moves outside the house to the balcony, an open space nearby or a local bar for some drinks. Whatever the case, make sure you have a plan in place. It usually is the perfect way to end an amazing Thanksgiving dinner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Thanksgiving is about the conversations, the meals, the laughter, and the gift of friends and family to celebrate with. As long as that is guaranteed, most people don&#8217;t care that they&#8217;re in a small space. So sit back, relax and enjoy your Thanksgiving with roommates and those around you.</p>

Approximately 65 miles from the state capital Denver, Colorado, and 45 miles south of Cheyenne, Wyoming, Fort Collins sits at the base of the Rocky Mountain foothills.</p>



<p>Its economy is a mix of service-related businesses and assembling. An outdoorsy, mid-sized, dynamic city, Fort Collins is surrounded by snow-capped mountains, clear rivers, and natural lakes.</p>



<p>Known for its 300-days of year-round sunshine, summers here are mild to hot, with July being the warmest. Moreover, winters are mild to moderately cold, with December being the coldest. Additionally, if you love the idea of a winter wonderland, early September through to the end of May is snow time!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tour De Fat</h3>



<p>The <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.newbelgium.com/visit/fort-collins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Belgium Brewing Company</a> hosts the annual Tour de Fat, which sees droves of people riding bikes dressed in costumes. Fort Collins was a non-alcoholic town until 1968 when Colorado State University students protested to end the prohibition. This brewing company was conceived to recall the company&#8217;s beginnings and celebrate the established cycling community in Fort Collins.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tour De Farms</h3>



<p>Running 35-40 miles, <a href="https://bikefortcollins.org/tour-de-farms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tour De Farm</a> is a half-a-day bicycle charity fundraiser ride held annually in Fort Collins. It begins and ends at the Farmer’s Market or a local brewery. It also features a mix of paved and gravel road rides and a few stops at local farms. Moreover, at each farm stop, there will be tastings and refreshments on offer, along with welcoming representatives or owners to greet you.</p>
