										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the extensive digitization of the real estate sector, property management has become more efficient and exposed to cyberattacks. The more landlords and property investors rely on online platforms, intelligent security systems, and cloud-based data handling, the more they become susceptible to cybercriminals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Strategies to protect your real estate investment in the digital age should recognize the potential dangers of everything from general cybersecurity issues to protecting and managing extensive data and vendor management.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-establish-processes-to-protect-software-integrity">Establish Processes to Protect Software Integrity</h2>



<p>To ensure the security of property management software, financial records, lease materials, and maintenance logs must be protected. Cyber experts are usually looking for vulnerabilities in the software to access real estate systems unauthorized. Establishing <a href="https://www.wiz.io/academy/software-supply-chain-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">processes to protect software integrity</a> is key to preventing data breaches.</p>



<p></p>



<p>With access controls in place and constant software updates, the risk of exploitation is minimized. A great number of breaches are caused by outdated software with known vulnerabilities. As always, having all applications patched and in place and using security monitoring tools invariably enhances protection.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Conduct audits on all software vendors and get them to comply with cybersecurity standards; this strengthens them. If a property management platform does not prioritize software integrity, the chances that sensitive property data may be hacked become very high.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-elevate-cybersecurity-standards">Elevate Cybersecurity Standards</h2>



<p>Digital property management makes cybersecurity a priority. Weak passwords and old software leave a real estate investment an open target for hackers to gain control. To protect your investment, use a <a href="https://psono.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">password manager</a>, password expansion policies, two-step identification, and advanced cryptography to limit access to sensitive information.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Cyber insurance provides an additional means of protection against possible damages. It covers losses from hacking, ransomware, or an organization&#8217;s data breach. Thus, with correct coverage, an organization would remain safe in case of an attack and secure any sensitive property-related information.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Regular software updates are vital for cybersecurity as well. Most cybercriminals target outdated systems and use loopholes to attack. Cyber threats will significantly reduce your real estate investments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conduct-thorough-vendor-security-checks">Conduct Thorough Vendor Security Checks</h2>



<p>Property managers need systems for third-party vendors. Maintenance, security, tenant management, and cleaning are all essential services for properties and their managers. Sometimes, a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/automate-security-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad vendor management system</a> may expose property owners to innumerable risk factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This could happen when the vendor opens pathways to your property&#8217;s digital nervous system. Therefore, thoroughly vetting the vendor to see how they align with your cybersecurity policies is a must.</p>



<p>Vendor security contracts allow risk mitigation. Such contracts outline a vendor&#8217;s primary IT responsibilities; they should hold the vendor responsible for protecting sensitive data and access to property management systems. Ensuring vendors adhere to industry-standard security practices will shield your investment from indirect cyber threats.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Regular audits of vendor security practices can help identify potential vulnerabilities. Vendors should be regularly required to provide cybersecurity compliance reports and submit background checks to verify that their systems meet your security expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A slip-up in vendor security can expose access controls to your property and your tenants, which can be dangerous to both.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secure-smart-home-and-security-systems">Secure Smart Home and Security Systems</h2>



<p>Smart door locks, security cameras, and automated property systems have become an easy way to create vulnerability in cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several systems of smart homes connect, posing a threat to your investment and tenants&#8217; lives when hackers take advantage of otherwise vulnerable systems and gain unauthorized access to your property. The proper configuration and secure maintenance of all intelligent devices are essential.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Smart security devices utilizing encrypted connections can protect data from hackers&#8217; interception. Many smart home systems connect via Wi-Fi, which ideally should have strong passwords and encryption protocols. Investment in high-quality, cyber-secure devices from recognized manufacturers will reduce potential threats.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Routine security updates and firmware patches for smart home technology fix many security loopholes. If the software is not routinely updated, it can serve as a secret getaway route for cybercriminals. Maintain a good habit of regularly checking and installing software updates so that no opportunities for illicit entry into your property remain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implement-data-protection-strategies">Implement Data Protection Strategies</h2>



<p>Investors and property managers deal with sensitive data, such as financial information, lease conditions, and tenant information. Such violations are expensive and may result in legal complications. Flawless data protection mechanisms are essential in guarding against unlawful access and dissemination of sensitive information.</p>



<p></p>



<p>What data must be kept safe is thus essential to security. Password-protected, encrypted files ensure that, even if hackers access your system, your sensitive information remains unreadable to them. Using secure cloud storage options with end-to-end encryption provides that extra layer of protection.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Access controls should also ensure that only a selected few are allowed to view and/or change property-related data. With role-based access management, access to particular information is only provided to individuals authorized to do so, thus minimizing the chances of internal threats or accidental data breaches.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-check-financial-transactions-regularly">Check Financial Transactions Regularly</h2>



<p>The complexity of financial fraud and mortgage cybercrime has also increased considerably. Cybercriminals frequently attempt wire fraud scams, phishing, and other unauthorized transfers. Utilizing monitoring systems to oversee financial transactions can reveal suspicious activity before the heavy damage begins.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Layering security systems in place is how banking transactions are made secure. Banks and financial institutions offer fraud detection software, which allows activities outside the set norm to prompt alerts. Use them to predict threats early.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Maintaining exclusive accounts for property transactions can prevent unauthorized persons from accessing personal or business funds. Segmenting rental incomes, security deposits, and operational expenses into three separate accounts considerably lowers the opportunity for financial fraud to attack each dimension of one&#8217;s investment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-back-up-critical-data">Back-Up Critical Data</h2>



<p>Data loss caused by cyber-attacks, hardware failures, or human-perpetrated errors can result in great monetary damages. Regular backups ensure critical property data is never lost permanently due to crises. An effective backup strategy calls for multiple copies stored in separate locations.</p>



<p>Choosing a secure cloud backup service that synchronizes itself regularly reduces the possibility of losing data. Cloud providers usually use security measures like encryption and redundancy to reduce the threat of cyber attacks on data secrecy.</p>



<p>Offline backups further secure the property by creating a third level of redundancy against emergencies. A physical hard drive or storage unit for an important signed contract or document ensures it is still available should an intrusion cause network failure or battles for access.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-use-of-secure-communication-channels">Use of Secure Communication Channels</h2>



<p>Real estate professionals, property managers, and tenants usually send sensitive information digitally. Communication channels with unsecured data naturally lead to data leaks, phishing, and unauthorized access to property-related documents. Secure channels always help protect confidential information. If email is the primary communication method, using a <a href="https://easydmarc.com/tools/dkim-lookup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DKIM checker</a> ensures the authenticity of emails, helping prevent phishing and unauthorized access to sensitive documents.</p>



<p>Encrypted email services and secure messaging applications are less susceptible than standard email and SMS. Standard <a href="https://www.sender.net/blog/business-email-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email providers</a> simply lack sufficient encryption to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-ends-partnerhsip-with-garbo-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safeguard against cyber threats</a>; switching to encrypted services does address that issue.</p>



<p>Motivating tenants and vendors to use highly secured channels for their online rent payments, maintenance requests, and document submissions raises the stakes for protection. Once more, avoiding public Wi-Fi for property management exposes the entity to more hacking attempts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cybersecurity-incident-response-plan">Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan</h2>



<p>Cyberattacks can occur despite the most diligent planning to prevent them. A proper cybersecurity incident response plan initiates immediate action to reduce the effects of a cyber attack. With a proper plan, money, tenants, and property are safeguarded.</p>



<p>With a team officially established with specific roles and responsibilities, call it into action to allow timely decision-making. Assigning members the duties of detection, containment, and mitigation improves the overall efficacy of your response.</p>



<p>Regular tests and updates of the incident response plan enhance its effectiveness. Conducting simulated drills can also allow you to enhance your procedures and ensure your team is ready when the need arises.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-endnote">Endnote</h2>



<p>Real estate investors in the digital age can expect their share of opportunities and risks. Proper cybersecurity policies, ongoing interaction with vendors, and regular monitoring of digital systems assure the safety of properties from hackers, long-term safety, and profitability of real estate properties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Transitioning from home ownership to renting is an exciting but responsible milestone. Living on your terms is made possible by your newfound independence but necessitates prudent money management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Understanding personal finance is crucial for first-time renters, and doing it correctly may guarantee a stress-free renting experience. You may successfully and more efficiently manage your funds with the help of this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-establishing-a-budget">Establishing a Budget</h2>



<p>One of the first steps to renting is creating a clear and realistic budget. Renting comes with several costs beyond just your monthly rent payment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/roomis-guide-for-the-first-time-renter/" class="broken_link">first-time renter</a>, you may need to familiarize yourself with the many expenses that must be factored into your budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how to break it down:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rent">Rent</h2>



<p>Your largest expenditure is rent, which should not take up more than 30% of your income. For instance, if your monthly income is $3,000. Try to keep your rent at $900 or less.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, where you reside, and your financial circumstances play a role. The aim is to ensure that <a href="https://junehomes.com/blog/2023/01/05/how-much-rent-can-i-afford/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rent comfortably fits your budget</a> while allowing room for other essential costs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-deposit-and-upfront-costs-nbsp">Security Deposit and Upfront Costs&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Most landlords want a security deposit &#8211; typically one month&#8217;s rent &#8211; before you move in. Additionally, some can wish to pay the first and final month&#8217;s rent in advance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember to factor in additional costs like background checks, applications, and relocating. Planning for these upfront expenses is critical because they may rapidly mount up. Moving in can go much more smoothly if you prepare beforehand.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-utilities">Utilities</h3>



<p>Additional expenditures to consider include utilities such as power, water, gas, and internet. If they are not included in your rent, you must estimate these costs depending on the size of your home and the number of people living there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To minimize surprises, find the typical utility bills in your region. Energy-saving behaviors can help keep these expenditures under control.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-renter-s-insurance">Renter’s Insurance</h2>



<p>While it&#8217;s not always necessary, renter&#8217;s insurance is a wise choice. It usually costs between $10 and $30 monthly and covers you in the event of theft, fire, or accident. You&#8217;ll be able to relax knowing that your possessions and responsibilities are protected for such a cheap price. If anything unforeseen occurs, it&#8217;s a simple method to prevent higher costs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emergency-fund">Emergency Fund</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s essential to have an emergency fund to deal with those &#8220;just in case&#8221; situations, such as a vehicle repair or medical cost. Strive to accumulate enough cash for three to six months&#8217; living needs. You won&#8217;t need it all at once, but putting aside a small amount each month can help you create that safety net and maintain financial stability in case anything unforeseen occurs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enhancing-liquidity-and-staying-prepared">Enhancing Liquidity and Staying Prepared</h2>



<p>Liquidity, or having enough cash to cover expenses, is crucial for renters. Unexpected costs like car repairs or medical bills can arise at any time. Just as contractors use systems like <a href="https://www.joist.com/trades/hvac-estimating-and-invoicing-app/">Joist HVAC invoicing software</a> to maintain steady cash flow, renters should ensure they have sufficient funds to cover rent, utilities, and other costs.</p>



<p>Automating payments and building an emergency fund will help you manage financial surprises smoothly. Apps like Mint or YNAB can track your spending and give insights into your liquidity, allowing you to make better financial decisions. By staying organized and preparing for the unexpected, you can maintain a stable economic situation throughout your renting journey.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-automating-your-finances">Automating Your Finances</h2>



<p>You have to stick to your budget and pay your bills on time. Not only may late rent payments damage your relationship with your landlord, but they can also <a href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/credit/how-to-improve-your-credit-score">lower your credit score. </a>Automating your financial transactions is one technique to prevent this.</p>



<p>You can set up automatic transfers with your bank so your rent is deducted on the same day every month. Doing this may prevent late fines and take the guessing out of remembering to pay your rent. You may use the same strategy for other monthly expenditures, such as utility bills.</p>



<p>To ensure you never miss a deadline, utilize the recurring payment capabilities if your landlord accepts payments online.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-managing-utility-payments-with-ease">Managing Utility Payments with Ease</h2>



<p>Utility bills can occasionally get tricky while renting, mainly if you live in a big apartment complex or share the expense with roommates. To keep things organized and clear, you may utilize applications to manage payments between housemates and divide costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Budget billing, which averages your utility bills over a year and costs a fixed amount each month, is now available from several utilities. This can reduce fluctuating payments, which can help you manage your budget more efficiently. Consider contacting your utility provider for energy-saving advice or even a home energy audit to determine where you may save money if you discover that your heating and cooling expenses are more significant than anticipated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-lease-agreements-and-tenant-rights">Understanding Lease Agreements and Tenant Rights</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s important to comprehend the terms of the lease and your rights as a renter before signing. A lease is a formal agreement specifying your obligations, the monthly rent, the lease length, and the guidelines for the rented property. Spend some time reading the lease, noting specifics like the security deposit clauses, your maintenance obligations, and the notice periods for moving out or terminating the agreement.</p>



<p>Knowing your rights as a renter might help you avoid possible trouble with your <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/" class="broken_link">landlord</a>. Learn about the local maintenance rules, eviction procedures, and rent hikes. Before signing the lease, don&#8217;t hesitate to get clarification or legal counsel if you have any questions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avoiding-debt-pitfalls">Avoiding Debt Pitfalls</h2>



<p>Many new tenants face the problem of wanting to use credit cards as a last resort to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Credit cards may be a helpful tool for managing cash flow and establishing credit, but avoiding taking on excessive debt is important. Credit card interest rates that are too high might send you into an impossible-to-break debt cycle, mainly if you can&#8217;t afford to pay off your balance each month.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble making ends meet, you might want to talk to your utility provider about setting up a payment schedule or negotiate a rent payment plan with them. As long as you are upfront and honest about your financial situation, many landlords and businesses are prepared to deal with renters with financial issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-planning-for-future-rent-increases">Planning for Future Rent Increases</h2>



<p>Over time, rent rates often rise, particularly in markets with intense competition. As part of your budget, set aside money for future rent changes to ensure you&#8217;re not caught off guard by an unanticipated rise in rent. You may prevent financial hardship if and when your rent increases by having additional money, even if it doesn&#8217;t happen immediately.</p>



<p>Investigating your rights as a renter is also a good idea. Rent control regulations restrict how much your landlord may raise your rent annually in some places. You may negotiate better lease conditions and feel more at ease knowing these regulations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Although certain financial obstacles are associated with renting for the first time, you may efficiently manage your money with careful planning and astute techniques. These methods will assist you in quickly navigating the rental world, from defining a realistic budget to automating payments and keeping liquidity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, being financially independent will release you from the worry of being unable to make your rent payments on time and let you enjoy the freedom and independence that comes with renting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the things a lot of people avoid but sometimes can’t control is bad credit. Having bad credit can make apartment searching very difficult. Your credit score is very essential because it plays a major role when you want to rent an apartment. Most landlords demand to know the credit scores of their tenants so they don’t rent out to a tenant with bad credit. If your roommate has bad credit, this can pose major problems. Here are a few tips that can guide you.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be aware of your credit score</h2>



<p>This is because the landlords have access to <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/who-are-the-three-major-credit-bureaus-960416" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit bureaus</a>. They check if you are a worthy tenant or a tenant with negative information on your credit score. This check can drastically reduce your chances of getting an apartment. You should know what is on your credit report so that you can correct any errors. You should also be aware of your roommate’s bad credit.</p>



<p>Some sites can help you <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-check-your-credit-score-free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">check your credit score</a> for free.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get financial recommendation</h2>



<p>To avoid situations where your roommate has bad credit, you need to get a financial recommendation before getting a roommate. You need someone to vouch for your roommate’s financial responsibility. This will prevent a situation of your roommate breaking the lease or having to sue your roommate for financial negligence. Your roommate can get someone to vouch for them by contacting their previous or current employers, previous or current landlords, or reaching the bank for a reference letter. Here are some concrete reasons why your roommate has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickclements/2015/09/10/3-reasons-responsible-people-have-bad-credit-scores/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad credit</a>.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Unemployment</li><li>Medical bills</li><li>Divorce</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get a roommate with a good credit score</h2>



<p>It’s said that you can get an apartment if you have a good credit score, even if your roommate has bad credit. However, it’s advisable to only get a roommate with a good credit score to avoid situations of unpaid rent or your roommate not paying for essentials that you both need. If both of you have good credit scores, it will help you make your payments on time and build your financial credibility for the future. Having no credit and a stable income that is 3 times more than the monthly rent is good. It shows reliability and gets you letters of reference from your former landlords when you need them. If your roommate has bad credit, they can submit any document that shows they are working on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-repair-your-credit-960377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repairing their credit</a>.</p>

				</div>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make your payments upfront</h2>



<p>Sometimes it’s a struggle to get a roommate, and when you finally get one that’s in sync with you, the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/bad-credit-when-finding-an-apartment-in-nyc-heres-help/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate has bad credit</a>. It is important to note that not all landlords check either your’s, your roommate’s, or both of your credit scores. This, therefore, enables you to provide proof of whomever’s credit score is better to secure the apartment. In addition, if that isn’t the case, you can pay a higher deposit upfront of 3 months. This will show how serious you are. It will show that you can be trusted and will subsequently ease the Landlord’s concerns. Also, the upfront payment helps to avoid your roommate breaking lease agreement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prove your worth and improve your credit score</h2>



<p>The fact that your roommate has bad credit does not mean they have not been entirely responsible for their finance. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-rent-an-apartment-with-bad-credit-960969">a stable income</a> can help fix their credit record and get that apartment for both of you. A stable monthly income, which is at least three times the monthly rent, will be a great indicator to your landlord when you provide solid proof that you can keep up with your payments. It is well known that <a href="https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/is-no-credit-better-than-bad-credit" class="broken_link">having no credit is better than bad credit</a>. Well, the first step to improve your credit is to catch up on all of your late payments and pay them in full to avoid additional interests. Sufficient income sometimes offsets a negative credit history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The sheer number of us that have graduated from high school without actual knowledge of managing our finances, is insane. You’re in your 20s, trying to figure the world out, and suddenly you’re forced to deal with taxes, student loans, and rent. Don’t even get us started on the costs of entertainment and grocery shopping! It’s a tough life. But believe us or not, it doesn’t have to be that way. Achieving financial freedom in your 20s isn’t an insurmountable task. And most of us are ready for it! There are some easy and practical ways to approach our financial situations. And, completely doable, even if you’re dealing with debt and just starting on your financial journey!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-living-within-our-means-is-the-first-step-to-financial-freedom">Living within our means is the first step to financial freedom.</h2>



<p>This might seem like the most obvious piece of advice. But for many, it isn’t. Many of us have spent thousands of dollars on our credit cards, not realizing that instant gratification is just that. Instant gratification. It also comes with the added trouble of credit card interest and debt, most of which becomes a huge financial burden on those of us that can’t limit our spendings. And believe it or not, that’s a lot of us.</p>



<p>Living on a budget can be the best thing you can do for yourself, especially in your 20s. Life can be fun, without the extra spendings on a credit card!</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/out-of-the-college-into-the-real-world-financial-tips-to-start-saving-money/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Out of the College, Into the Real World: Financial Tips to Start Saving Money</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-managing-whatever-debt-there-is-can-help-you-get-in-control-of-your-finances-fast">Managing whatever debt there is can help you get in control of your finances fast.</h2>



<p>When you have decided to create a budget for yourself, and skip on the extra credit card spendings, try focusing on managing your debt. This means, cutting down on your daily spendings, and whatever you’re saving, putting that towards the debt that you might be dealing with. This could be your student loans, car debt, <a href="https://www.freedomdebtrelief.com/learn/credit-card-debt/how-much-credit-card-debt-is-too-much/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit card debt</a>, and anything else you may have borrowed in the past. Most people also recommend picking up a side gig to help with their bills when they’re trying to get off of their debt.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-save-and-then-save-some-more-and-take-yourself-to-the-financial-freedom-you-ve-always-dreamt-of">Save and then save some more and take yourself to the financial freedom you&#8217;ve always dreamt of!</h2>



<p>Being able to save is a highly nifty and wondrous habit that takes a lot of willpower to inculcate. Unless of course you’re one of those people who save first, breathe later. (We’re highkey envious). Your 20s is the best time to start saving. Honestly, it doesn’t even matter if you’re 28 and just considering saving. Something is truly, better than nothing.</p>



<p>Consider the money that goes into a savings account an essential part of your budget (tip: you can even make it automatic by diverting a monthly amount into savings). Start with an emergency fund and go from there.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cultivating-marketable-skills-and-freelancing-on-the-side-can-help-you-quickly-catch-up-with-any-debt-you-might-have">Cultivating marketable skills and freelancing on the side can help you quickly catch up with any debt you might have.</h2>



<p>Yeah we mentioned this one briefly before, but this really is an important one. When you have the time, learning a new skill that you can sell as a freelancer, is yet another way of looking out for yourself financially.</p>



<p>Many people learn how to write if they’re good with communications, do accounting if they’re quick with numbers, and design stuff if they’re artistically inclined! It’s all about finding the sweet spot between things you can do and like to do. Start from there, and watch yourself find new ways to beef up your savings!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gaining-financial-literacy-and-learning-how-to-invest">Gaining financial literacy and learning how to invest.</h2>



<p>Most people, once they’re through their 20s, and thinking of the bigger picture, like marriage, and getting a house, find themselves wondering why they didn’t think about this same bigger picture before. Not all of us can be Youtube and TikTok famous in our 20s. (Though there’s no harm in trying!) And for those of us, it’s still possible to have a house before we reach our mid-30s.</p>



<p>Teach yourself as much as you can about things like investing. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/roth-iras">Open a Roth IRA</a>, and allow yourself to reach the financial freedom that you often find yourself dreaming about. The earlier you start investing, the more money you will have down the road, thanks to the awesome power of compound interest.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-establishing-a-good-credit-score">Establishing a good credit score.</h2>



<p>This is where our advice is just the slightest bit more complex. Once you have accomplished most of the aforementioned steps, start thinking about keeping one credit card, that you only sync those payments with, that you know your paycheck will be able to cover.</p>



<p>A credit card can be one of the most effective ways to achieve financial freedom, but only if you pay off the balance each month. You can also get a small auto loan or other small obligation that you can make monthly payments on. This will help you in the future as you buy a home, and even as you look for good deals on auto insurance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to buy groceries on a budget?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Add cheap, filling &amp; versatile items to your grocery list</h3>



<p>Eggs are a great choice as they are not only inexpensive, you can also easily whip up&nbsp;<em>sooo</em>&nbsp;many great dishes using them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. The best way to do grocery shopping in NYC? Just don&#8217;t.</h3>



<p>Before you head out to get groceries on a budget, take a good look at what you already have in your pantry. If you can prep a meal with those canned red beans and that ignored frozen chicken shoved all the way back in your freezer &#8211; then you don&#8217;t need to shop.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Focus on seasonal produce</h3>



<p>Drop whatever off-season fruit/vegetable you have on your grocery list. Not only will it cost a bomb, but it might also not taste that good.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. There&#8217;s more to shelved items that meet the eye</h3>



<p>Avoid picking shelved items linear to your eye level as they tend to be the most expensive variant. Which also means no grocery shopping in a rush. Take your time and explore other brands of the product you have on your grocery list.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Bring Your Own Bag</h3>



<p>Think 360 degrees when you&#8217;re getting groceries on a budget in NYC. A shopping bag from the grocery store can cost anywhere between 50 cents to a dollar.</p>



<p>Also, you might need a couple of them depending on how long your grocery list is. You can easily save $10-$12 per month.</p>



<p>What more can I say, it&#8217;s budgeting baeby!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>College exposed you to bits of the adult world – it taught you to live by yourself, find your own way, made you independent, and gave you the experience of jobs. As a college graduate, you’re doing great so far. But bear in mind that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/life-side-college-vs-post-grad-roommates/" target="_blank">adulting has more challenges</a> in store for you, like saving money.</p>



<p><strong>Related:<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-ways-to-save-money-and-make-money-in-college-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 7 Ways to Save Money and Make Money in College</a></strong></p>



<p>You’ll move out of your campus housing and find your own place; you won’t have a cafeteria but maybe a kitchen, and you’ll be traveling about a lot more.</p>



<p>The sooner you have a grasp on your financial situation, the better. It can be overwhelming, but don’t stress! We’re here to help you figure out the basics with these financial tips.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Open a savings account</h2>



<p>You may not have a lot right now, but opening a savings account is the first step. Keep your money in the bank and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.hellolatch.com/us/cyber/quick-safety-tips-for-online-banking-for-beginners-latch/149/" target="_blank">do the transactions</a> through there. Take a day or two to understand <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/savings-accounts" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">which savings account works best</a> for you and your career plans. The saved money in this account will serve you during emergencies, sometimes return interests, and make you feel more confident in your ability to save.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Review your budget</h2>



<p>Now that you’re taking care of your own finances, understand where your money is coming from and where it’s going. The next step is to draw a budget plan. Your budget plan should include a list of all your major expenditure, and how much of your money goes into each one monthly:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-november-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rent</a> and utilities</li><li>Food</li><li>Student loans</li><li>Transportation</li><li>Savings</li><li>Wardrobe, entertainment, miscellaneous</li></ul>



<p>Calculate the approximate amount of money you must set aside for these purposes. Now, if there are any leftovers, it goes into the savings or debt repayment. Install <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/best-money-saving-apps" target="_blank">apps that help you save money</a> and give you financial tips. At first, it’s not going to be easy at first. But as you get better jobs and get the hang of managing money, your budget plan will start looking better.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Make a student loan payoff plan</h2>



<p>Is the adulting college graduate in you ready for this? Student debt: The biggest challenge in the lives of Millennials and Gen Z. The sooner you clear your debts, the more you will save money on interests. The first steps to take:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Fix the budget</li><li>Set a goal</li><li>Consider your payment options (below)</li></ul>



<p>Consider switching payment methods for federal loans – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans" target="_blank">here are the different repayment plans by the government</a>. See if you <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/what-is-loan-forbearance-deferment" target="_blank">qualify for deferment</a> of your student loan, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/lower-payments/get-temporary-relief/forbearance" target="_blank">for forbearance</a> based on your financial situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Review your credit report and scores</h2>



<p>Get a credit card as it helps you build a positive credit history; it also comes with benefits and rewards. A card helps <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-build-credit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build your credit score</a>. The most important financial tip here is to use your credit card responsibly and make payments on time.</p>



<p>Your credit report holds details of your credit use and history. Your credit score is a score that depends on your credit report details. These are important in making long-term decisions like refinancing student loans, getting a mortgage, buying a car, etc. Check your credit report <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Prioritize your spending</h2>



<p>Your highest priority while saving money:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Pay off debts &gt; Emergency fund &gt; Everything else</p></blockquote>



<p>On a smaller scale, keep going back to your budget plan to remind yourself of the priorities. We’re not saying don’t have fun with friends at all, but consider what kind of fun you can afford to have as a fresh college graduate. There will be times when you come into more money than other months – resist the urge to splurge.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some everyday financial tips to save money</strong></h2>



<p>Learn to cook for yourself, clear your due payments and bills on time, use public transport, find free stuff and discount sales around you, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/7-ways-to-make-money-online-during-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelance</a>, hold your own movie nights, and make use of happy hours.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When it comes to filing your taxes, the whole process seems extremely, *&nbsp;cough *&nbsp;<em>taxing</em>&nbsp;if you don&#8217;t have the first clue about how to file taxes. However, with a couple of budges in the right direction, anyone can take up filing their taxes — and still, have the option of hiring professional help in their back pocket.</p>



<p>Tax season dawns upon the American population in the middle of April each year. This sends a good clueless fraction of the population into quite the flux.</p>



<p>Add to that the number of college students that pick up extra jobs increasing each year. We, therefore, witness an increase in the number of people who would qualify as first-time taxpayers each season.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a compilation of the most asked questions by college students who are considering filing their taxes for the first time. Read on to find out more.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do I have to file taxes as a college student?</h2>



<p>Determining if you should be filing taxes in a year is something that depends on how much income you made in that year. If your earned income (wages and tips) last year, was less than $6,300 and your unearned income (interest and dividends) was less than $1,050, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/refunds">filing a tax return</a> isn’t required.</p>



<p>Even if you made less than the minimum income required, you still might want to file taxes. Say you were working during any part of the year. And your employer took taxes out of your paycheck. Turns out, you might be able to get a fraction of that amount back as a refund for your effort.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a college student&#8217;s tax status?</h2>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://giphy.com/embed/8c12cvfahEqP5O3dO2" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/evite-eviteirl-evite-irl-taxation-8c12cvfahEqP5O3dO2"></a></p>



<p>Be sure to talk to your parents before you decide to file taxes. While living away from home and having the choice of making your decisions may feel like adulthood, you may still be considered a dependant when it comes to taxes. (<a href="https://www.irs.gov">Anyone under the age of 24 pursuing an education in the United States can be claimed as a dependant</a>)</p>



<p>The IRS states that if you&#8217;re a student, your parents can claim you as a dependant until you&#8217;re 24. Thus, it&#8217;s wise to consult your parents about your status of dependency. This is because it may affect how you prepare for your return.</p>

<p>The difficulty of a tax form differs with every individual&#8217;s situation. After you&#8217;ve received all your tax documents, you&#8217;ll be able to determine the<a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-instructions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> tax forms required in your situation to file your taxes with the IRS.</a></p>



<p>However, if your tax situation is relatively simple, you might be eligible for the 1040EZ. The 1040EZ can be considered the simplest tax form available — it&#8217;s a single page document available online as a form or in paper.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve filled in the preliminary details such as your name, Social Security Number, and address — consider yourself halfway done!</p>



<p>If your tax situation is a little complicated and you can&#8217;t use the 1040-EZ, then there&#8217;s the regular 1040 form. This form is relatively longer and more complicated than the 1040-EZ, but it isn&#8217;t more difficult.</p>



<p>For more clarification on&nbsp;<a href="http://irs.gov/forms-instructions" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">what form fits your tax situation and what documents you will be needed for the process, visit the IRS website.</a></p>

<p>There are two ways of going about filing taxes during tax season. You either do it yourself or pay someone to do it. If you&#8217;ve made less than $66,000 during the previous tax year and want to do your taxes yourself, you could use&nbsp;<a href="http://irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeFile, the IRS’ online basic tax filing software.</a></p>



<p>The IRS also has an easy to use app that can be used to file taxes called IRS2Go. It&#8217;s available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/irs2go/id414113282" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple App Store</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.irs&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Appstore</a>.</p>



<p>However, if you don&#8217;t feel confident enough about the process, or you&#8217;re on a time crunch or feel like you don&#8217;t know enough on the subject yet, you don&#8217;t have to file taxes on your own.</p>



<p>You can get help from a tax professional online, as well as in person. Your tax document needs and income level determines if and how much you have to pay to get your taxes done professionally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, countries around the world are facing COVID-19. But another pandemic lurks underneath and is less talked about: the epidemic of financial stress. The first one affects our lives, especially our health. And the second one is busy depleting our life savings however well we learn to manage our accounts. Although financial stress may be spreading as a by-product of the coronavirus pandemic, it has assumed massive proportions over time.</p>



<p>Financial stress has gained a life of its own with the closure of businesses, unemployment, and income loss. Needless to say, learning to cope with financial stress while learning to manage your accounts at such a critical time is important for your mental health. So we&#8217;ve put together some key tips.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Manage your mental health to deal with financial stress</h2>



<p>For the average person, financial stress is unavoidable right now. Sudden unemployment, a disruption in routine, uncertainty about the future, learning to manage your accounts are root causes of intense financial anxiety. And many of us feel there is no way out. It&#8217;s essential, then, to focus on your mental health during this stressful time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Take good care of yourself</strong> </h3>



<p>This begins with eating healthy food and following a good sleeping pattern. A healthy mind and body will be your best defense. Because it will give you the energy to deal with financial stress you might face right now. Health, they say, is wealth and is the best place to start.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practice healthy coping skills</strong> to deal with financial stress</h3>



<p>With lockdowns and physical distancing, it may not be possible to get to the gym or meet friends over coffee. So it&#8217;s time to change your go-to coping strategy and find suitable alternatives. You can experiment with other coping methods like video meetings with friends, using meditation apps, or spending more time in nature.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Be physically active</strong> </h3>



<p>In the current scenario, walking, strength training, and yoga are great ways to stay physically active. You&#8217;ll find lots of fitness trainers are running online classes to help you get in a great <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/creating-a-budget-friendly-gym-at-home-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">home workout</a>. So take advantage of this to keep financial stress at bay.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use your support system</strong> </h3>



<p>Share your financial stress with a trusted family member or friends if you feel that it&#8217;s getting overwhelming. Talking to your loved ones will lower your stress levels and make you feel less isolated. They could also find new perspectives on your situation or ways to get your financial anxiety under control.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Prioritize your payments</h2>



<p>As you need to spend cautiously right now, it&#8217;s important to manage your accounts and prioritize your bills. Especially those requiring immediate attention to deal with the financial stress. </p>



<p>As a first step, take care of your basic needs as a priority, as you may not have enough to make all payments. If you <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-things-to-do-if-you-cant-make-rent-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need to pay rent</a>, talk with your landlord to see whether they&#8217;re okay with you deferring the amount until you get back on track with your income. For credit card payments or home loan installments, talk to your bank. They may allow a delay in installments without the accrual of interest or late fees.</p>



<p>Depending on your location, government relief measures often allow banks and financial institutions to offer assistance. There could be options where you can pay late, pay less, or forego interest and late fees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Look for alternative sources of income</h2>



<p>No one is sure <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how long this pandemic will last</a>. So it makes sense to look for other income sources to supplement your earnings. Check out online projects where you can use your skills to earn extra money to deal with the financial stress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Get a loan for emergencies that cause financial stress</h2>



<p>If your savings are depleting and your emergency fund is empty, consider applying for a loan. You can check with private online lenders about whether they can offer you a personal loan, small business loan, or a <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.moneytap.com/blog/personal-line-of-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">line of credit</a> at favorable terms to help you deal with the financial stress.</p>

<p>Over 70% of people live from paycheck to paycheck. It&#8217;s a mental game called “Can we make it until next payday?” Surprisingly this way of life usually are not dependent on their earnings, but their attitude towards money.&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/earning-75000-and-living-paycheck-to-paycheck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS Money Watch</a>&nbsp;says about one-third of families earn more than $75k, and they live from one paycheck to another. It feels a bit like driving a car without a fuel gauge. There is no problem with running the vehicle, but there is always the risk of running out of gas. And people without there&#8217;s a plethora of excuses for not having a personal budget. But what we wonder is, why do people want to deny themselves financial freedom? Because that&#8217;s exactly what excuses for not having a personal budget do. They deny you financial freedom.</p>



<p>If we don’t budget, how will we know the areas where we are overspending, and how do we keep our finances in check? <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-develop-steady-habits-and-how-you-can-use-them-to-succeed/1399/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simply put: you can’t.</a>&nbsp;There are many excuses for not having a personal budget, and some of the most common ones are listed below!</p>

<p>Budgeting is not frightening, but it might shock you to know how your money is doing (or not doing!). Your spend analysis might prove that you help support businesses like Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Gucci, Chanel, Costco, Macy’s, and other designers from around the world. Try calling it ‘Cash Flow Plan’ for a change.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The best excuse for not having a personal budget: &#8220;I am not good with numbers!&#8221;</h2>

<p>Budgeting requires just fifth-grade math. Even so, this is the most common excuse you&#8217;ll hear! Having a personal budget requires minimal skills when it comes to numbers, and if you can solve 5–1=4, then you can budget your finances just fine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ignorance at its peak: &#8220;I am busy and don&#8217;t have the time to do a budget!&#8221;</h2>

<p>It may take a couple of hours the first time you create your budgeting plan because you may be required to go through your bank statements, past bills, outgoings, etc. The worst-case scenario is that you might have to spend 2 hours the first month. The following month, it will take half the time. The third month takes even less. Once you begin, you&#8217;ll find that it takes no more than 20 minutes to create a personal budget for the month.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;My friends and family will think I am crazy&#8221;</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>If your friends and family are making fun of you for being cautious about spending, you&#8217;re probably making a personal budget and sticking to it (that means not giving in to take-out every time they want it.) <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-ways-to-think-about-your-future-career-plan/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eventually, they will see you are debt-free and have extra money!</a> Freedom from debt is greater than mindless spending.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;I will start having a personal budget after I get ___.&#8221;</h2>

<p>The blanks are mere excuses to delay the inevitable &#8211; something that you are never really going to follow through with. When you say, &#8220;I am going to start training for a marathon after ________,&#8221; it requires thoughtful action to fill in the blanks. If true financial freedom is what you&#8217;re planning, go ahead and grab a pen and fill in the blank: &#8220;I will start budgeting <em>Right Now</em>.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The one that always fails &#8220;I already budget in my head and keep track of everything&#8221;</h2>

<p>Personal budgets get over, but excuses for not having a personal budget do not. </p>



<p>Utilities, cable, credit card payment, life insurance, mortgage, groceries, gas, gym membership, dining out, savings, auto insurance, student loans, birthday gifts, investing, mobile phone payments, hair and makeup, rent, coffee &amp; shopping. If you have an eidetic memory like Sheldon Cooper, then have it at. But if you&#8217;re anything like us, enjoying financial freedom will require you to make an excel sheet or use a budgeting app. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any money left to budget&#8221;</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>You don&#8217;t have money left to plan a budget because you aren&#8217;t budgeting. If there is even some money coming in, then you require a cash flow plan. Budgeting is merely telling your income where to go instead of wondering where it all went each month.&nbsp;Budgeting concepts are simple, and the equation is:</p>



<p>Budgeting = Having money</p>



<p>Not budgeting = Not having money</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;I cannot budget because I have an irregular income&#8221;</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>Honestly, it is slightly more challenging to budget on irregular income than fixed ones. But even when you have inconsistent income, you can still create a cash flow plan. There are different methods to set up your budget <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.moneypeach.com/how-to-make-a-budget-with-an-irregular-income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when your earnings are not the same.</a></p>

<p>Being on a first-name basis with your financial aid department will give you the opportunity to explore if you are eligible for financial aid or additional grants and scholarships. Don’t be afraid to ask for help!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Save money in college by making a weekly spending schedule </h2>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/tips-to-manage-your-finances-without-stressing-out-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It is easy to overspend during college.</a> Keeping a weekly spending schedule will keep you on track and to not overspend. Set a maximum limit for spending for each week of the semester (for example, $60 a week). Write down on your phone or computer what you spend money on each week. At the end of the week, calculate your total expenses. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Utilize your meal plan to save money in college</h2>



<p>It’s free food! If you’re paying for a <a href="https://www.everydollar.com/blog/create-a-meal-plan" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">meal plan</a>, make sure you use it. Go to the dining hall with friends and research other food spots on campus that are covered by your meal plan. Dining halls offer a variety of food options and are much more convenient than going to the grocery store weekly. Be smart, save money in college by going to the dining hall!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Be mindful of your spending on food and drinks</h2>



<p>Overspending can be tempting when friends regularly want to order pizza or go out to the bar (only if you’re 21, of course!) When making a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/10-ways-save-money-food-shopping" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">weekly spending schedule</a>, make sure a portion of that spending is for food and drinks. If you go out to the bar with friends, make sure that you have a limited amount of cash on hand instead of a credit card. </p>



<p>This will really help you save money in college, so you are not tempted to splash out. Don&#8217;t worry if you’ve spent too much money one week, suggest a movie night in with friends instead of going out!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Make a grocery list</h2>



<p>If you like to keep snacks in your room, make a list before going to the grocery store. Be sure to avoid going to the grocery store when you’re hungry; this will make you want to buy everything in sight! Buy off-brand items and items that come in bulk. They’re usually cheaper and will effectively save you money in college.</p>

Plan out the snacks that you want to have before making a trip to the grocery store. Try vegetables and hummus as a snack &#8211; it’s healthy <em>and</em> affordable!</p>
