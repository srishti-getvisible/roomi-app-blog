<p>We’re all on the same page on this. One of the most unpleasant chores is cleaning the bathroom! Stray hairs, mildew stains, and sometimes worse. But maintaining its cleanliness and regularly deep cleaning it is imperative. Because it <em>is</em> the place where you spend some quality alone time, too!</p>



<p>We have some easy hacks to help you get your bathroom cleaned quickly. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-divide-chores-with-your-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lighten your ch’ordeal</a> with these tricks:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Erase stubborn stains with baking soda</h2>



<p>When your bathroom cleaning solution and the sturdy dish brush have tried their best but conspicuous traces of mildew stains still stick around, reach for the baking soda.</p>



<p>Apply a paste of 3 parts baking soda and 1 part water and let it sit for three to four hours; spray with white vinegar liberally, and then thoroughly scrub and rinse it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Clean your toilet with antacid and mouthwash</h2>



<p>A few years ago, someone found out that pouring a can of cola into the bowl helped clean the toilet, and everyone had to try it! Even though it worked, here are two more alternative hacks you’ve got to try:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Antacid tablets:</strong> Drop two antacid tablets into the water in the toilet bowl and let them dissolve. After about 20 minutes, scrub the bowl and flush!</li><li><strong>Mouthwash:</strong> All it takes is a quarter cup of your daily mouthwash. Pour this into the bowl and let it sit for half an hour before you scrub and flush!</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Tackle grease and soap scum with baking soda and ammonia</h2>



<p>Get rid of those grease stains and aged soapy layers with a mixture of baking soda and ammonia.</p>



<p>All you need for this bathroom cleaning hack is 2 cups of warm water, 3 tablespoons of baking soda, and half a cup of household ammonia. Stir these ingredients together, wipe the solution on the stained spots, and rinse off with a wet rag.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Deodorize the drain with baking soda and vinegar</h2>



<p>The offensive odors from within the drain is a huge turn off when the bathroom is seemingly gleaming with cleanliness!</p>



<p>All you need is one cup of baking soda and two cups of white vinegar to get the drain to smell fresh, too. Pour the baking soda into the drain followed by the vinegar and after half an hour, flush it all with hot water.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Clean your bathroom chrome fixtures with lemon</h2>



<p>The citric acid in lemons is strong! Tackle the long-dried water flow and droplets on your chrome fixtures by rubbing lemon over these spots. A sponge should help you spread the lemon juice perfectly. The citrus fruit will also leave a pleasant smell behind!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Wipe the mirror clean with black tea</h2>



<p>All the condensed steam and soap-water droplets quickly get the bathroom mirrors dirty and blurry. It’s very unfair how unrealistically speckless the mirrors in movies are!</p>



<p>If you want a clean bathroom mirror, brew yourself a cup of strong black tea and take it to the bathroom! Wipe your mirror in circles with a soft cloth dipped in black tea. Then wipe again with a clean dry cloth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Soak your showerhead in vinegar</h2>



<p>It’s easy to clean your showerhead and prevent it from clogging. Do it with half a bowl of vinegar!</p>



<p>Every once in a while, remove the showerhead from the fixture and soak it in vinegar in a bowl. Cover with a lid and let it sit for a couple of hours. If your showerhead is undetachable, fill half a plastic bag with vinegar, immerse the showerhead in it, and secure the opening with a rubber band.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Clean the grout between tiles with these cleaning agents</h2>



<p>The dirt between tiles is tough! But with some Borax, baking powder, kosher salt, and bleach, you can trick them. Mix together one cup each of Borax, baking powder and kosher salt, sprinkle on dirty areas, and scour. Then place cotton balls soaked in bleach on grout lines that need cleaning; leave them overnight before rinsing your bathroom surfaces.</p>



<p>Cleaning your bathroom can really be made into a creative chore with these tricks to help you out!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Maybe you&#8217;re a bunch of students who have just moved away from home for four years of university. Or maybe you&#8217;re at home trying to reconfigure the dynamics of living with your partner. Whatever your situation may be, chores at home can make or break any co-living situation. We aren&#8217;t kidding. And without a chore chart or cleaning schedule, you and your roommate (or partner) are bound to fight. Trust us, chore list is extremely important, especially for roommates. </p>



<p>House chores are undoubtedly tedious and tiring. Folding the dishes, doing the lawn, mowing the laundry. Wait, no. Uh, you know what we mean. No. One. Likes. This. Stuff.</p>



<p>To be able to successfully and diplomatically work through this land mine, all concerned parties just need to come together one evening (preferably over snacks, maybe some wine) and with a pen and paper, make an actual activity out of this.</p>



<p>We doubt this can be accomplished to a similar effect if just one person chalks up a chores&#8217; list on the fridge on a frustrated morning.</p>



<p>The solution lies not in the list but in the system you set up.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Have a house meeting to work out the Roommate Chore Chart  ?</h2>



<p>When drawing up the roommate chore chart, take everyone&#8217;s input. After all, you don&#8217;t want to end up with a cleaning schedule where one roommate has to do more work than the other. After a set of household tasks are on paper, go through each task, asking around the table how many people wouldn&#8217;t mind taking up that particular job &#8211; you&#8217;d be surprised to know how many people find joy in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190515-can-decluttering-your-house-really-spark-joy" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">decluttering</a> or stress relief in mowing a lawn.</p>



<p>Similarly, ask for tasks that people absolutely despise. For instance, if you&#8217;re a despiser of washing the dishes three times a week, switch a few turns out with a couple extra runs for the grocery &#8211; with maybe someone who doesn&#8217;t mind getting their hands dirty (or clean?).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Welcome to Compromise City, Population: You and the roommate chore chart</h2>



<p>The list is bound to have certain tasks that no one enjoys. For the sake of maintained harmony and minimal shade served, split the undesired tasks as evenly as possible. You could also try switching up the chores over a monthly house-meeting (mmm, we smell a tradition ?).</p>



<p>A great tip is to tackle the less fun chores together &#8211; so time goes by quicker, and the entire house gets time to bond &#8211; or as we like to call it, a <a href="http://realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/laundry/laundry-room-cleaning-checklist" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">laundry</a> cleaning party.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Pocket Full Of Everyone&#8217;s Time</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s highly unlikely that your entire household will be running on the same schedule. Some might have the regular 9-5 grind, while others might have multiple jobs, off-timed shifts and others just regular nights of constant typing. Perhaps the sharing of chores can be done to fit everyone&#8217;s schedule &#8211; depending on what everyone&#8217;s most comfortable (re: least uncomfortable) with.</p>



<p>Also understand that people&#8217;s schedules change. And a foundational understanding and mutual respect for all members of the house is more important than any thing else here.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Remember, You Cannot Micromanage This.</h2>



<p>You may not be able to divide the chore list completely evenly amongst your roommates. And chances are, splitting the chores to a precise half, will only lead to resentment as things will never work out perfectly. We believe the most important thing at this junction is all parties sharing effort in maintaining your home: whatever that effort may be. The roommate chore chart will never be perfect, but it&#8217;s the effort that counts!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do as Elsa did</h2>



<p>Let it go. We all know that one nosey friend that will run to wipe the counter behind your back&#8230; After you have already done your best to clean it. And if you don&#8217;t know that one person, chances are you&#8217;re it. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s always best to remember that even with the best intentions in mind, you cannot impose your standards on people around you. Especially those people that are actually trying. Nobody&#8217;s perfect and being appreciative of those around you goes a really long way. Just make sure you and your roommates stick to the chore list as much as you can, and forgive the rest!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Last Resort</h2>



<p>Now this very preachy piece might click for you or it may not. Either way, we are all familiar with dysfunctional days when nothing seems to go our way. Those days call for scheduling help. Many people prefer a once-a-week <a href="https://www.tidy.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep clean service</a> (that can easily be hired over the internet). It&#8217;s basically meant to help you catch up on your chores while also catching all those corners we never really find the time for. So, come up with a cleaning schedule with your roommate that works for you. </p>



<p>This gives you the peace of mind that comes with a clean home and a mighty satisfied set of housemates!</p>
