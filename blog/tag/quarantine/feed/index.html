										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whether you&#8217;re already in a long-distance relationship and currently dating someone or single and swiping away on dating apps, having to self isolate thanks to the pandemic has been especially tricky for our love lives. While still respecting the safe at home order, it is only natural to feel a little antsy to not to be able to go out and see people. Well, this is where one has to start thinking of virtual date ideas.</p>



<p>We are sure the bars and the parks miss you, but just because you can’t go out on outdoor dates and see each other in person, doesn’t mean you can’t build relationships from the comfort of your house.</p>



<p>This could also be the perfect time to not only get to know someone on a deeper level but also introspect and further invest in your existing relationships.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick list of some fun activities you can do with someone when you’re not physically in the same space. A lot of these things could also be done with your friends and family; they don&#8217;t have to be specific to romantic or sexual partners.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Virtual date ideas for gamers! </h2>



<p>There are so many different kinds of games out there, both competitive and cooperative. Be it easy breezy and accessible fun mobile games or serious sit-down PC / console gaming, the possibilities are endless!</p>



<p>A lot of games that you play online together don&#8217;t involve speaking to each other, so a video call is a good way to carry on communicating whilst you’re playing the game.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse">Make it more fun by adding your own twists to it, such as the person who wins a game gets to ask the other person a challenging question or give them a dare.</pre>

				</div>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Virtual date ideas for your inner nerd!</h2>



<p>Make a book club! Read a book together and then organize a time to have a video call to discuss the said book. Consuming the same things together and discussing them is a great way to connect with your partner. Reading to each other is also a great virtual date because it can inspire thoughtful conversations.</p>



<p>You can experiment with a book, an article, or even a podcast episode! Taking an online personality test or relationship quizzes together is not only entertaining, but the results could be very amusing too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Netflix and….party?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.netflixparty.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix Party</a> (or Teleparty) is a chrome extension that allows you to watch content simultaneously while texting on the little chat box that appears.</p>



<p>And it is always a good idea to either have an audio or a video call or even plain texting to make sure its a conjoint experience.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Groovy virtual date ideas!</h2>



<p>This one’s for all the music lovers out there &#8211; Create a joint playlist!</p>



<p>You can create private playlists that you both have access to, can add songs to, and listen to at the same time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Get back to the classics</h2>



<p>Cooking and eating dinner together over video calls and the quintessential dinner dates never gets old. To spice things up, you can also decide to buy the same ingredients and plan what you’re going to cook. You could also get adventurous and order a surprise meal for each other.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Warning:</strong> Not for picky eaters.</pre>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Sing your sorrows away…</h2>



<p>Karaoke night is our favorite! Get some tunes up on YouTube, put your video call on, have a few drinks, and burst into song! Also, a good day to put on your favorite concert outfit and dance your heart out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Pop open a bottle!</h2>



<p>Wine nights are a must if you&#8217;re going to try out one of these virtual date ideas. Sorry, we did not make the rules. Hop onto Zoom or FaceTime and pour a glass of wine and talk about anything and everything. Don’t be afraid to get a little tipsy for a little wine helps to loosen up the conversation like nothing else can.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Last but definitely not least, make sure to treat it like a real date! Just because you’re alone in your room doesn’t make it any less of a date. Dress up in something that makes you feel confident and don&#8217;t forget to have fun y&#8217;all!</p>



<p>(If nothing else you&#8217;ll have some very interesting stories to tell your grandchildren!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While some of us might be willing to live with life’s ills, without investing time in cleaning during quarantine, there might be some who are desperately trying to find an antidote to the shelter-in-place situation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“When all else fails, cleaning the house is the perfect antidote to most of life&#8217;s ills.” </em></p><cite><em>Sue Grafton</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>The tricky part about staying at home 24/7 is REALLY getting to know your roomis. Things you might have been willing to overlook before, come entirely into focus when you’re staying in to flatten the pandemic&#8217;s massive curve.</p>



<p>One of the aspects: coming face to face with each other’s cleaning habits. There are different species of the human race when it comes to cleaning. There are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-roomate-is-a-slob/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the slobs</a>, the indifferent ones, the &#8216;wish I were cleaner, but I don’t want to do anything about it&#8217; ones, the excessively paranoid ones, and the ones who do it once in a while as a form of therapy.</p>



<p>If your roomi is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/style/ocd-coronavirus-challenges.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">diagnosed or shows signs of OCD</a>, you should be gentle and mindful about their condition.</p>



<p>But if they don’t, and are suddenly bent on endlessly performing house cleaning during quarantine, then there are some things you could do:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cleaning during quarantine isn&#8217;t bad. Figure why it&#8217;s annoying you and talk to them about it.</h2>



<p>Feels simple, doesn’t it? We all know it isn’t. But if their ways of cleaning during quarantine are acting as an obstacle to your peaceful dwelling at home, you need to talk about it instead of sweeping it under the rug.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t like confrontations, you could look at their display picture in the eyes and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/texts-resolve-common-roommate-conflicts/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">text them your issues to sort them out.</a></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find a middle ground between both your cleaning habits.</h2>



<p>If you’re bothered by their cleaning habits, there&#8217;s a possibility they might be bothered by yours. Try and meet at the clean middle ground. Even if you like a messy room to yourself, clean up after you use the shared spaces in your house. Keep the kitchen, pantry, bathroom, and living area tidy. If they still don’t loosen up when it comes to cleaning, it’s on them. At least you did your bit.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Their cleaning during quarantine could be a coping mechanism, let them have it.</h2>



<p>If your room is a mess and you like it that way (despite the worried stares from the squeaky clean roomi), it&#8217;s best to keep your mess out of their sight. Shut your door when you come out of your room, or hide your mess like you would from your mom.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Respect their cleaning habits!</h2>



<p>You know how you can&#8217;t help <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/best-netflix-shows-series-to-watch-in-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">binge-watching on Netflix </a>for hours on end as a coping mechanism; similarly, your roomi could <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/coronavirus-stress-cleaning-organizing_l_5e792b57c5b6f5b7c5498ecb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be cleaning during quarantine as a coping mechanism too</a>. While both of these are good in moderation, you should check yourself and the people around you if it becomes an excessive habit. Tell the other that it’s all going to be okay, and they don’t need to indulge in unhealthy habits to avoid reality.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Divide your quarantine cleaning among all roommates!</h2>



<p>This might sound like work, but it will make your life easier for them and you. Take the initiative, make a list, and share it with your roomis. The advantage of taking the initiative? You get to choose what you like and leave the rest for them! Your cleaning-obsessed roomis will be happy that you took the effort and might even thank you for leaving the dirty bits for them!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Try avoiding a fight. No one should be fighting over cleaning during quarantine.</h2>



<p>If you’re laidback and don’t care much about how your home looks when no one’s visiting, try being laidback about their preferences as well. Don’t pick a fight or let it go, even if they start it. Invite them to hang out with some beer or wine and let them pour their grievances all out.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:71%">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find some inspiration in their cleaning habits.</h2>



<p>If you’ve been thinking of cleaning up for a while now, without ever getting to it, take inspiration from your cleaning-obsessed roomi and give it a try. It will help you judge them less for their cleaning habits, and who knows, you might get obsessed too!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hey there, procrastinators, are you all set to leave your old ways behind and be productive? Many of us are spending a lot of time indoors as work from home becomes our new reality because of COVID. While this may be something you&#8217;ve yearned for for years, it somehow feels challenging to be productive in quarantine, especially because there&#8217;s no one watching you. Working from your home office just doesn&#8217;t feel right.   </p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you start work way after sunrise or at the witching hour, whether you&#8217;re a full-time employee or a freelancer. These tips are for anyone having hard time working from their home office. Let this article be your guide whenever the lines between comfort and work start to blur.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-define-a-work-from-home-station">1. Define a work from home station</h2>



<p>If you are like 98% of us who get distracted easily, you need a workstation like an island; serene but cut off from the world. Are you familiar with the distractions of the bed and the seduction of those crisp fresh sheets that call you to nap? This is by far the hardest part of working from home. Don&#8217;t fall victim to those temptations &#8211; separate your workstation from your nap station. Start by dedicating a corner or a room as your &#8216;workplace&#8217;. That way, when you enter it, you know, you are &#8216;going to work&#8217;. Bottom line &#8211; don&#8217;t try to sleep where you work and don&#8217;t try to work where you sleep. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-set-a-work-from-home-schedule">2. Set a work from home schedule</h2>



<p>Imagine reaching your 10 am shift at the office by waking up at 10 am. Impossible right? Unless you&#8217;re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(Barry_Allen)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barry Allen</a> &#8211; then it&#8217;s possible! For a successful work from home scenario, you need to work exactly how you used to work at the real-life office. If you used to wake up at 8 to exercise and commute to work, try following the same pattern with your work from home regime. Switch your otherwise commute time with a shower, prepping coffee, enjoying a hearty breakfast, or studying your to-do list. For all of the harm it has caused, COVID has also brought with it the gift of time for a lot of us. Use it wisely. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-don-t-work-from-home-in-your-pjs">3. Don&#8217;t work from home in your PJs</h2>



<p>We are all guilty of this. Working in our PJs and throwing a shirt on top for those office conference calls has become the &#8216;new normal&#8217; during quarantine. However, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/working-from-home-tips-get-dressed-never-wear-pyjamas-stay-productive-psychology/368185#:~:text=Sure%2C%20staying%20in%20your%20PJs,sleep%20patterns%20and%2C%20perhaps%20most" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies suggest</a> that staying in your PJs all day long may adversely affect your mental health, focus and productivity.  And no one wants that when you&#8217;re already in the middle of dealing with COVID.</p>



<p>We are a product of routine, and getting dressed every day plays a huge part in our daily routine. One of the biggest luxuries of work from home is the freedom to wear what you want. So ditch your regular sleepwear and get into those comfy clothes and only change into your PJs when you decide to call it a day.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-declutter">4. Declutter</h2>



<p>All the messy people in the house get your hands up&#8230;and clean. If your workstation adorns superhero miniatures, tangled up wires, and dishes from last night &#8211; it&#8217;s time for you to put those things away and declutter. COVID is already stressful enough, you don&#8217;t a messy home environment to make it worse.</p>



<p>An ideal desk should be close to a window and have all the stuff you need, like a bottle of water, quick snacks, and stationery. The goal is to avoid distractions, your trips to the fridge, and to maximize productivity. And who knows, maybe you&#8217;ll finally be able to revamp your home decor in quarantine!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-give-yourself-a-break">5. Give yourself a break</h2>



<p>Just because you&#8217;re at home all the time because of quarantine, doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t need a break. After all, most people haven&#8217;t been able to relax since they found out about COVID. But you need to schedule break times and use them to recharge (come what may). This will increase your productivity, especially when you start boring tasks that you have been procrastinating over for a while.   </p>



<p>When beginning these tedious tasks, set a 15-minute timer and train yourself to focus. When you know that there is light at the end of this dull tunnel, you will glide through it like a pro. Make sure your breaks are not more than 10 minutes, or this activity will turn counterproductive. ou can even consider playing PC games during your break and use your favorite game items, such as a <a href="https://www.yuplay.com/product/fortnite-catwomans-grappling-claw-pickaxe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Catwoman pickaxe</a>, to unwind and refresh your mind.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-prepare-your-to-do-list-and-your-meals-the-night-before">6. Prepare your to-do list and your meals the night before</h2>



<p>The pain of working from home and prepping your meals alongside this is something that we are all too familiar with. Save yourself the trouble and prep your meals and your to-do list the night before &#8211; it saves you plenty of time and energy and is something the entire Roomi team swears by. How else do you think you get an article every day?! Also, for all of you living on instant noodles and potato chips &#8211; get yourself a real meal, you guys! You can become amazing home chefs by the time quarantine ends if you start now! </p>

<p>Well, what a bummer summer has been so far; one bad news after the other. It&#8217;s only natural to feel sad and frustrated when you&#8217;re in quarantine. We&#8217;re all sitting on our couches, out of things we can do at home. Many of us are working from home, and most of us are just Netflix-ing and vegetating. </p>



<p>So, while the world takes its time to heal, here&#8217;s what you can do with all that free time you have. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Try your hand at some art therapy as you quarantine.</h2>



<p>Everybody can draw. Yes, even you! Coloring, drawing, and sketching are said to relieve stress, improve focus, and enhance sleep. If you&#8217;re a beginner, try mandala patterns or adult coloring books &#8211; it&#8217;s all bout having fun and creating something unique.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Aprender un nuevo lenguaje ?</h2>



<p>That means &#8216;learn a new language&#8217; (in Spanish).

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Train your dog a couple of quarantine tricks</h2>



<p>Honestly, our dogs are the only ones who are super happy about this whole COVID 19 quarantine &#8211; how else could they possibly spend sooo much quality time with you? Having said that, they too get bored, and all that boredom leads to chewed up bedsides, earphones, and finding shredded toilet paper trail around your house. You can not only train them to get beer cans from the fridge but also correct<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/zakgeorge21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> essential behavioral problems </a>while bonding at home with your doggo.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Give back through some online volunteering during such trying times.</h2>



<p>Do you wish to do social work and help organizations reach out to humans/animals in distress? With the COVID 19 virus keeping all of us inside our homes, it might seem challenging to volunteer. However, there are organizations like the <a href="https://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">UN</a>, <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zooniverse</a>, <a href="https://www.togeanconservation.com/remote-volunteer-openings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Togean Conserve Foundation</a> who are running virtual volunteer programs(how cool is that!) and are looking for good peeps like yourself.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do it yourself! DIY is a gift for those of us stuck at home.</h2>



<p>Think you don&#8217;t like DIY? Think again. With all the creative possibilities available to us, there&#8217;s gotta be something out there you can build. Either way, it&#8217;s time you harness all that hidden talent and put it to good use. Go grab your glue gun, scissors, and everything DIYish you can lay your hands on because today we are <a href="https://in.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=diy&amp;rs=typed&amp;term_meta%5B%5D=diy%7Ctyped" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">making something super pretty for your room</a> and for the gram.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Read a book or twelve as you quarantine.</h2>

<p>Here you have unlimited lives and death doesn&#8217;t matter(unless you forgot to save your game, then you&#8217;re screwed), you have a great bod, you can control your life, and you can go anywhere you want(Nepal or the underground &#8211; the world is your playground). <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Try steam</a> and let off some steam.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be a superhero!</h2>



<p>Ok, yes, we know it sucks to be at home in quarantine, but remember that you&#8217;re a real-life HERO! You&#8217;re not only protecting yourself but millions around you by staying home during this challenging time of Corona induced quarantine. </p>
