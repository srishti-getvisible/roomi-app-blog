<p>Queens can be easy to navigate by walking or cycling. With rush hour traffic, it can often be faster to just bike or walk if your commute is short and allows it. This may be something you want to keep in mind while finding rooms for rent in Queens. Walking or biking can be a great way to save money. When it comes to public transportation, there are many options to get around as well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Subway </h3>



<p>Many&nbsp;<a href="https://new.mta.info/maps">New York City Subway</a>&nbsp;lines run through Queens and serve 81 stations across 7 lines. You can use the Subway to get around Queens or even nearby places like Manhattan or Brooklyn directly.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mta.info/lirr">The Long Island Rail Road</a>&nbsp;also has many stops in Queens and you can visit their sites to check if your route is served by either.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Buses</h3>



<p>Buses can also be a great way to reach places that are not served by the subway system. If you are finding rooms for rent in Queens in a place that does not have a subway system, you can use express buses or local buses. You can use the&nbsp;<a href="http://tripplanner.mta.info/MyTrip/ui_web/customplanner/TripPlanner.aspx">MTA trip planner</a>&nbsp;to check the routes operated by the MTA New York City Bus and MTA Bus brands.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis</h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Ferries and water taxis in Queens</h3>
