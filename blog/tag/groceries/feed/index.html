<p></p>



<p>Now that you’ve unpacked your boxes and are somewhat settled into your first apartment, the next (big) step is grocery shopping. Remember, your first homemade meal in your first apartment is special! But before that, you have to prepare the ingredients and everything else you need. So, in creating your first apartment grocery list, make sure to include these essentials.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="kitchen-pantry">Kitchen/Pantry</h3>



<p>Usually, the pantry includes everything that you’ll buy most often or the staples you like to keep around the house. These can be snacks, cooking essentials, or beverages (such as coffee, of course!).</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Cooking oil</li><li>Bread</li><li>Rice</li><li>Peanut butter</li><li>Jelly</li><li>Easy-to-eat canned goods</li><li>Pancake mix</li><li>Cereals</li><li>Pasta</li><li>Pasta sauce</li><li>Coffee essentials (beans/instant coffee, creamer, sugar)</li><li>Tea</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="fridge-freezer">Fridge-Freezer</h3>



<p>Having your fridge-freezer full is a good to-do for your first apartment as you’ll be saving money from not eating out. Plus, proteins you won’t eat immediately can be kept in the freezer until you need them, while food for the following week can be stored in the fridge and cooked when you’re hungry. Here’s what you should keep stocked in the fridge-freezer:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Meat (ground beef, chicken, pork chops)</li><li>Seafood (fish, shrimp)</li><li>Eggs</li><li>Milk</li><li>Butter</li><li>Cheese</li><li>Fresh fruits and vegetables</li><li>Fried food (hotdogs, fries, sausage, bacon)</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="spices-and-condiments">Spices and Condiments</h3>



<p>Cooking delicious food requires some basic spices, so make sure to have these in your kitchen. More than that, having condiments and sauces can add that extra kick to your meals. Here are some of the basics you need:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Salt</li><li>Pepper</li><li>Garlic powder</li><li>Chili powder</li><li>Ketchup</li><li>Mayonnaise</li><li>Mustard</li><li>Salad dressing</li><li>Hot sauce</li><li>Vinegar</li><li>Soy sauce</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="baking">Baking</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="19596" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/first-apartment-grocery-list/attachment/baking-goods/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="baking-goods" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="baking-goods" class="wp-image-19596" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=1250%2C834&amp;ssl=1 1250w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>You don’t need to be an expert baker to make cookies or even banana bread! So, grabbing these ingredients is totally harmless, not to mention you might even develop a skill or two. Plus, these ingredients don’t spoil easily, so even if you’re not big on baking, keeping them in your kitchen until you need them is totally fine. Just make sure to keep them in air-locked containers or zip-top bags to stave away bugs.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>All-purpose flour</li><li>Baking powder</li><li>Baking soda</li><li>Granulated sugar</li><li>Yeast</li><li>Shortening</li><li>Canola or vegetable oil</li><li>Vanilla extract</li><li>Toppings (Chocolate chips, nuts, sprinkles)</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="toiletries">Toiletries</h3>



<p>If you didn’t bring any with you or just want to stock up, toiletries should be part of your first apartment grocery list. Here’s everything you need for the bathroom.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Body and hand soap</li><li>Facial cleanser</li><li>Toothbrush and toothpaste</li><li>Mouthwash</li><li>Floss</li><li>Cotton swabs</li><li>Feminine hygiene products</li><li>Facial wipes</li><li>Toilet paper</li><li>First aid kit</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cleaning-supplies">Cleaning Supplies</h3>



<p>Not only can you get an exercise out of cleaning, but also a clearer mind (and better focus). With that, keeping your first apartment squeaky clean should be a priority! So, to have a clean and tidy living environment, include these cleaning supplies in your apartment grocery list:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Paper towels</li><li>Garbage bags</li><li>Zip-top storage bags (Ziploc bags)</li><li>Dishwashing materials (sponge and soap)</li><li>All-purpose cleaner</li><li>Laundry detergent</li><li>Rubbing alcohol</li><li>Baking soda (this is GREAT <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/8-cheap-bathroom-cleaning-hacks-to-ease-your-chore-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">for cleaning</a>!)</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tips-for-your-new-apartment-shopping-list">Tips for your New Apartment Shopping List</h3>



<p>Now that you’ve got a rough idea of what to shop for while settling into your first apartment, here are a few tips. You can also find a few <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/8-secrets-to-spending-less-while-grocery-shopping-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">grocery shopping secrets</a> that can come in handy for your first apartment grocery list.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Don’t shop hungry!</strong> Giving in to temptations (and impulse buys) is much easier when you’re hungry. Maybe you didn’t need those three packs of Oreos after all&#8230; To avoid this, eat a snack before going shopping or simply go once you’ve had a meal.</li><li><strong>Budget accordingly.</strong> Shopping for groceries is fun (especially if you’re shopping for yourself), but remember to follow your budget! When going for groceries, one thing you can do to follow your budget is have a specific amount of cash on hand. With this, you’d be avoiding overspending because you’d only be spending what you have in your pocket.</li><li><strong>Organize your list.</strong> Having your first apartment grocery list organized will make shopping much more manageable. Put similar items together so when you’re walking through the aisles, you’ll be able to grab them all in a single go rather than having to double back to aisles you’ve been to previously.</li><li><strong>Consider your space.</strong> If you’re a college student or a young professional living in a tiny apartment, you may have limited space. When shopping for groceries, think about the space they will take up. You may think buying a lot of canned food is okay until you’re trying to fit them all on your shelf!</li></ul>

<p>And when it comes to cutting corners, the easiest place to start is your groceries. This doesn&#8217;t just help you inculcate habits of spending less but also helps you save more money.</p>



<p>That being said, people&#8217;s reasons for wanting to split bills can run beyond wanting to save money. Ever so often, conflicts arise and bills are some of the toughest topics to argue over.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-fix-your-relationships-with-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Even when roommate conflicts are pretty much inevitable</a>, eliminating them is our favorite thing to do. Setting systems that reduce conflicts is the best thing you can do when managing monthly expenses with roommates.</p>



<p>Here are some things that you can do if you&#8217;re looking to split your bills wisely, budget better, or set boundaries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communicate your need to budget better.</h2>



<p>Communication needs to be the central aspect of any relationship. And talking about money is also an important aspect of your relationship with your roommates. It may seem like an uncomfortable topic at first, but getting it on the table is required for a healthy relationship.</p>



<p>Have a house-meeting with your roommates and talk about your household expenses. This is one of the first steps in creating a better budget.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">List out all your expenses.</h3>



<p>Go through all the expenses you will be collectively enduring and write it down in the form of a document. This will also come in handy if you&#8217;re faced with confessions later on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fix your household costs.</h3>



<p>This is how you will be creating a better budget. You can take this opportunity to make notes, and divide who pays for what. Or who pays <em>how much</em> for every item.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Discuss your rent.</h3>



<p>Is there a difference in the sizes of your rooms, or the way space is divided in your apartment? Here&#8217;s where you adjust your budgets accordingly.</p>



<p>Some people like to divide the costs equally, no matter the difference in housing. Others prefer dividing it based on who uses what. We don’t think there’s a right or wrong way to do this, but a transparent discussion will ensure everyone is comfortable.</p>



<p>Your ultimate goal should be to create a monthly budget for your household that is inclusive of most of everyone&#8217;s needs. Yep, <em>most of everyone&#8217;s needs</em>, because all would be too idealistic. Unless of course you&#8217;re able to accomplish that. In which case, hurray! You&#8217;re already budgeting better than most of us!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">List your respective budgets.</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re splitting groceries, you must communicate each person&#8217;s bills accordingly. A vegan roommate would probably be uncomfortable paying for their roommate&#8217;s meat consumption.</p>



<p>Additionally, some people might have their monthly expenses for groceries capped at $100, while others might not be comfortable shelling out more than $40 dollars.</p>



<p>Talking about how you will be dividing groceries is an important aspect of budgeting better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create a system that suits all your roommates&#8217; budgets.</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s technological support for everything today. Based on the way we&#8217;ve tried and tested, two methods stand out the best.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Create a spreadsheet to help you budget better.</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re a bunch of people that anticipate changes in your living, this is the way to go. Creating spreadsheets is a flexible way of budgeting groceries better. A spreadsheet is completely customisable and can be tailored based on your exact needs.</p>



<p>This needs to be a team effort, and will require patience. Especially when you are importing Excel formulas to automate your monthly expenses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use a budgeting app.</h3>



<p>This is the best way out for roommates who do not appreciate sitting down together every month to do the math. Automating calculations is also an easy way to save time. There are several apps available today that can help you budget better. Some of our top recommendations include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.splitwise.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">SplitWise</a> — super easy interface, one of the best options in the market currently.</li><li><a href="http://www.spendee.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spendee</a> — Syncs with online banking options and allows for easy finance management for families or groups living together.</li><li><a href="http://billr.me/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billr Me</a> — Great app for people spending on an outing. The app will also add in taxes and tips. A copy of the split bill can be sent to the rest of the group members.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Out and about shopping for groceries with your roommates? Here are <em><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/8-secrets-to-spending-less-while-grocery-shopping-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Secrets To Spending Less While Grocery Shopping</a>!</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Discuss payment schedules</h2>



<p>The last straw in creating a better budget for you and your roommates is to discuss when all payments will be made. You will have to take into consideration the date mentioned on your lease for rent payment. As well as the date everybody gets paid from work.</p>



<p>Finding a middle ground between the two is the sweet spot you should be aiming for. The whole process in general will also require active inputs from every individual along the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you&#8217;re prepared for the unexpected, you can readily embrace last-minute accidents or a change of plans without feeling like you&#8217;re losing control. Earlier this year, we saw how COVID-19 sneaked up on us, reshaping our society in lasting ways. When an emergency strikes, it&#8217;s never expected. It could be an earthquake, or a family member falling ill. Even losing power for a few days is unthinkable, and we wonder about basic essentials.</p>



<p>Also, chances are you might be working from home. And so, now with all of the above in mind, it makes sense to stock up mindfully for an eventuality. Now is the time for preparation – not to panic. Even if your local stores are open and stocked, you want to avoid crowded places and maintain distancing. While toilet paper and bottled water are flying off shelves, the list of COVID essentials is longer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Shelf-stable food, groceries </h2>



<p>Before purchasing food, check expiration dates, and plan out your consumption. Keep food allergies in mind and take only the necessities.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Canned goods</li><li>Pasta</li><li>Cereals</li><li>Crackers</li><li>Granola bars</li><li>Dried fruits</li><li>Dehydrated foods&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mountainhouse.com/m/shelf-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like this 24-serving bucket with a shelf life of 30 years</a></li><li><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=lp_16310101_nr_n_17?fst=as%3Aoff&amp;rh=n%3A16310101%2Cn%3A%2116310211%2Cn%3A16322721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Chips, crackers, nuts</a></li><li>Other fun (but also healthy) food</li></ul>



<p>Non-perishable foods are a must for plenty of potential emergencies; they&#8217;re perfect COVID essentials food-wise. Protein bars and dehydrated fruit have long shelf lives and deliver high energy despite their small size.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Drinking water</h2>



<p>If you do not have a water filter and your tap water is unfit to drink, you could stock bottled drinking water. As per the Department of Homeland Security, on average, a person requires half to one gallon of water per day. But it depends on you to decide how many days of water supply you need.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Prescription medications</h2>



<p>You can stock or refill essential drugs vital to you with the help of your doctor and pharmacist. This way, you avoid venturing out. This is especially helpful with the elderly at home as they are the most vulnerable when it comes to COVID-19. Also, you may want to consider some First-Aid kits as the time taken for ER admissions just keeps increasing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Toiletries</h2>



<p>If you have a particular skincare routine that depends on specific products, now is the time to buy a few months&#8217; worths of those toiletries. All over the world, supply chains are being disrupted by the pandemic. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you need to worry about running out of basic essentials like soap, which many different companies make.
