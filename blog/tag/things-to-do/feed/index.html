<p>Looking for new places to grab a quick and economical bite to eat in the Big Apple? Street food in NYC has always been a big part of the city’s culture. Rich or broke, young or old, there can’t be many New Yorkers that wouldn’t readily agree to a hot dog.</p>



<p>The tricky thing about food carts, however, is that they’re constantly on the move. So, if you like one, you’d better save their phone number!</p>



<p>To help you keep track, we’ve pinned down the current locations of all the best street food vendors in NYC. You could be a newbie to New York or a native, looking for that one food cart you loved but lost. Whatever the case may be, the food trucks on this list will not disappoint you!</p>



<p>Take a look below.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. NY Dosas</h2>

<p>Located in Washington Square Park, this food cart operates from 11am &#8211; 3pm every day except Sundays. It serves authentic South Indian food so good that it’s even got its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NY_Dosas" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>



<p>The cart is owned and run by just one man, Thiru Kumar, who’s basically a local celebrity. And he makes some of the best Indian street food in NYC. The dosas (a savory, Indian-style crepe) and samosas are its most popular items, highly sought-after by college students.</p>



<p>The dosas are served with sambhar and coconut chutney. And unlike a lot of street food in NYC, all the food is fully vegan and gluten-free. After finishing your mouthwatering meal, you can pay by either cash or Venmo.</p>



<p>Thiru posts regular updates about the cart on his <a href="https://twitter.com/nydosas?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nydosas/?hl=en" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> pages. For his <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MpvZVXVkNPX91uaL7" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">exact location</a> and other info, you can check out the <a href="http://nydosas.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">NY Dosas website</a>.</p>

<p>Mom’s Momo serves some of the most famous street food in New York. It&#8217;s located in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/UvPA3n1mz8Q5kE7n7" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackson Heights</a> and serves traditional Tibetan cuisine. Momos are steamed flour dumplings, usually filled with meat or vegetables, and served with spicy schezwan sauce. As far as street food in NYC goes, there aren’t many carts that serve momos like this!</p>



<p>Mom’s doesn’t have a large menu, which we feel adds to its appeal. They serve a select few dishes that will leave you licking your fingers off. One review states, “The dumplings were a form of perfection never before realized on this planet.” Need we say more?</p>



<p>So forget the FOMO and just try these momos. For regular updates, you can follow their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/momsmomo18/?hl=en" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page. And, if Jackson Heights is too far, you can check out their second truck in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cBCDf8JDoGsKrsBH8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Queens Boulevard, Sunnyside</a>.</p>

<p>Operating since 1982, Ling’s serves some of the best Manhattan street food. From its name, you can probably tell that the cart serves sweet cakes. For just $1, you can buy a bag full of the original-flavored fried cakes. Their fluffiness makes it super easy for you to finish them off without much help!</p>



<p>While these cakes are also served with multiple condiments, Ling’s regulars suggest eating them as they are. So, for some of the lightest and sweetest street food in NYC, give Ling’s shot.</p>



<p>Ling’s is located on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/e81ZA8yNiLVVMyQB6" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Manhattan’s Canal Street, Chinatown</a>. And, though not very active, you can visit their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LingsSweetMiniCakes/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> page to learn more about them!</p>

<p>Kwik Meal is owned and run by former Russian Tea Room chef, Muhammed Rahman. The most talked-about and sought-after meal at this Manhattan street food cart is its marinated lamb.</p>



<p>The lamb is marinated overnight in multiple spices, yogurt, and green papaya. Then it’s served up in a slice of pitta bread or over a plate of basmati rice. We think it’s some of the tastiest street food in NYC.</p>



<p>Is your mouth watering yet? The cart’s owner is also quite a treat, serving up fun conversations along with his food. Catch this famous food cart on the <a href="https://g.page/KwikMealNYC?share" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">6th Avenue</a> of Manhattan and follow their <a href="https://m.facebook.com/373209939376999/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> page for more updates!</p>

<p>The Halal Guys is a chain of street food carts operating across New York City. Considering the lawsuits they’ve had to file on various impersonators, they’re definitely serving the most famous street food in NYC.</p>



<p>The original Halal Guys have been around since 1990 and have an ever-increasing fanbase. As suggested by many reviews, their white sauce is a definite must with whatever dish you choose.</p>



<p>These guys are so popular that they have their own <a href="https://thehalalguys.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>, as well as an app! They also offer the option to start a franchise, if you’re interested in that. You can find the cart nearest to you using the website’s <a href="https://thehalalguys.com/locations/location-finder/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">location finder</a>.</p>

<p>Indian King Biryani House, as its name might suggest, serves up some of the best Indian street food in NYC. As you can see from the picture, this food cart has got quite a vast menu. That doesn’t make its food any less amazing, however.</p>



<p>On the contrary, the chicken biryani served here is a foodie favorite, with meat that’s super tender and well spiced. Besides that, some other popular dishes are chicken tikka, kati rolls, and samosa.</p>



<p>For some of the spiciest and best street food in NYC, catch Indian King Biryani House on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/17sGTnTKdkb8wncC6" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Broadway</a>. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find any social media handles for this one.</p>

<p>Would a street food guide really be complete without some Mexican food? We think not. Birria-Landia is mostly known for its eponymous dish <em>birria.</em> It is a traditional Mexican stew made using a combination of spices.</p>



<p>Besides that, Birria-Landia is also quite popular for its tacos and mulita. This food truck has got some of the tastiest Mexican street food in NYC. It’s also one of the very few places in the city that actually serves birria.</p>



<p>Birria-Landia is currently present in two locations, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Hu8FcKuM7PbxXt3D7" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooklyn</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/qB83MDDbE1HihBfd8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Queens</a>, with a third one on the way. You can check out their <a href="https://thebirrialandia.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">website</a> for menu and other information, as well as their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/birrialandianyc_/?hl=en" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-job-opportunities">1. Job Opportunities</h3>



<p>Right now, the economy in the whole Bay Area is booming. Silicon Valley and other high-tech firms in the area have created a job surge, making it one of the most healthy economies in the country today. If you have the right skill set, you can work for Netflix, Google, Facebook, Apple, Tesla, and other companies. There are several possibilities for you to start up a&nbsp;business in this market.</p>



<p>If you aren&#8217;t interested in working in high-tech, there are still plenty of opportunities in healthcare, hospitality, and other non-tech industries. But keep in mind, only a well-paying job will help you survive the high cost of living in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Pros and cons of living in San Francisco &#8211; Nature &amp; Fun</p>



<p>Some people find that they can fill their free time without ever leaving the area, whether they go down to see the Golden Gate Bridge, cross to see the redwoods, stay on the piers, or enjoy the unique culture.</p>



<p>If you feel like taking a day excursion, you may go to Yosemite and enjoy the sunshine on the peninsula or drive to Lake Tahoe for world-class skiing in four hours (with decent traffic). Half Moon Bay is around thirty minutes east of San Francisco. You may also get to Napa Valley in approximately an hour when traveling north.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-extremely-dog-friendly">3. Extremely Dog-friendly</h3>



<p>If you spend any time in San Francisco, you&#8217;ll immediately question whether you&#8217;re in a city designed for humans or dogs. It was named the most dog-friendly city in the country in 2016. There are accommodations and amenities for your canine companion everywhere, from dog parks to dog hotels.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-boasts-diversity-and-progressive-values">4. Boasts <strong>Diversity and Progressive Values</strong></h3>



<p>San Francisco is a minority-majority city with a diversified ethnic population. The Mission District is home to many Hispanic communities, and you can still sense the city&#8217;s rich Hispanic culture and heritage there.</p>

<p>The high cost of living in San Francisco is mostly due to demand exceeding supply, particularly because tight zoning restrictions prevent &#8220;Manhattanization,&#8221; or the development of towering, high-density homes. Living with roommates and picking a good location will help! But, expect to spend a significant portion of your income on housing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-homelessness">2. Homelessness</h3>



<p>San Francisco does not have a larger ratio of people who are homeless than other large American cities. However, a combination of conditions, including warm weather, a shortage of space, and a huge population of unsheltered homeless people, has caused the problem to spread rapidly.</p>



<p>The homeless problem in San Francisco is also more evident than in other places. Because the Tenderloin, the city&#8217;s poorest area, is near South of Market (SoMa), the city&#8217;s wealthiest commercial district, it&#8217;s not uncommon to find homeless people strewn amid high-rise office buildings and luxury condominiums.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re likely to spend a lot of time caught in traffic if you plan on having a car in San Francisco to go across the Bay Area. In addition to the sky-high cost of living in San Francisco, it also had the fifth-worst traffic congestion in the world in 2017. Additionally, it has the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inrix.com/scorecard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-worst</a> traffic congestion in the United States, with drivers spending an average of 79 hours stuck in traffic. Gas rates in San Francisco tend to be higher than in other places. So, idling in your car will cost you money.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-unpredictable-weather">4. Unpredictable Weather</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ll experience wide-ranging temperatures, as well as microclimates that cause weather variations within the city. Moreover, cold, powerful winds are usual, and wildfires and earthquakes are always a possibility. Some people are worried by the weather&#8217;s unpredictability, while others appreciate the general moderate temperature, which lacks snow and scorching heat.</p>



<p>Moreover, they don’t call San Francisco “Fog City” for nothing. It tends to blanket the west side of the city most heavily, to the point where Divisadero Street is often called the “fog line.” Some like the fog, however, thinking it gives the city character.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-moving-to-san-francisco-for-you">Is Moving to San Francisco for You?</h2>



<p>San Francisco, in addition to the regular difficulties of city life, has its own concerns to deal with. This includes a homelessness epidemic, headline-grabbing housing pricing, and unusual weather patterns. Of all, no city is ideal, so the pros and cons of living in San Francisco largely come down to your own priorities.</p>

<p>Everyone wants something different, and you can make what you want out of it. That being said, the pros and cons of living in San Francisco do not undermine its unique approach to “big city life”.</p>

<p>The iconic <a href="https://palaceoffinearts.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palace of Fine Arts</a> is one of the city&#8217;s most visited San Francisco attractions. Whether you visit during the day or at night, Greco-Roman architecture is a sight to see. You can do an informal photoshoot or walk around the palace; it&#8217;s totally free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="try-out-various-free-walking-tours">Try out various free walking tours</h3>

<p>Spending a day exploring <a href="https://goldengatepark.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Golden Gate Park</a> isn&#8217;t enough for some people due to its many attractions. It&#8217;s mapped just like Central Park in New York City and has museums, gardens, and various activities within the park. Here are some of the cheap things to do in San Francisco:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong><a href="https://www.calacademy.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Academy of Sciences</a>:</strong> As the most visited museum in San Francisco, the California Academy of Sciences is the gem of the park. It&#8217;s like going to a science fair with interactive exhibits, a four-story rainforest, and &#8220;<em>Claude</em>&#8221; the albino alligator! They have different kinds of tickets which range from $29 to $33 each, and they even offer a student discount.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.sfbg.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Botanical Gardens</a>:</strong> With more than 50,000 plants, visiting the Botanical Gardens is like going on a nature trip in the middle of the city. The garden also has meditation sessions and a botanical wreath-making class! Plus, admission is free for San Francisco residents, just bring a document showing your address and ID, of course. The Botanical Gardens is a great place to hang out with your roomies without spending a dime.</li><li><strong>Stow Lake &amp; Strawberry Hill</strong>: Head straight to Strawberry Hill and sit by the falls for a more peaceful and quiet retreat. Pro tip: bring a pair of binoculars for some bird watching, a camera, and packed food. Strawberry Hill has a small artificially made waterfall where you can take pictures and just relax. Plus, you can even meditate at the Golden Gate Pavilion or jog to the top of the hill. These are just one of the fun things to do in San Francisco.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="experience-the-magic-at-magowan-s-mirror-maze">Experience the magic at Magowan&#8217;s Mirror Maze</h3>



<p>For $10, <a href="https://www.magowansinfinitemirrormaze.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magowan&#8217;s Infinite Mirror Maze</a> offers a one-of-a-kind psychedelic experience (that&#8217;s 100% legal!). With black lights and &#8220;infinite mirrors,&#8221; escaping the maze sure is a challenge! You can spend a day in here and just let loose with your roomies!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="have-a-feast-in-chinatown">Have a feast in Chinatown</h3>



<p>One of the best things to do in San Francisco is <a href="http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">explore Chinatown</a>, the oldest and largest in North America. You can have a feast of the best Chinese food and walk through culture and history.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Chinese temples:</strong> There are many colorful temples you can visit with your friends while in Chinatown. Here, you&#8217;ll get a glimpse of the Chinese religious culture, and some offer rare historical artifacts. You&#8217;re free to enter the temples, but remember to keep the sanctity of the place by being respectful during your visit.</li><li><strong>Golden Gate Cookie Factory:</strong> If you&#8217;re curious about the process of making fortune cookies, visit the Golden Gate Cookie Factory for a free tour. You can even get a free sample of a freshly made fortune cookie!</li></ul>

<p>Think a playground is just for kids? Think again! One of the most fun things to do in Berkeley, this landmark is a must-visit for all ages.</p>



<p>More commonly called the <a href="https://www.visitberkeley.com/directory/adventure-playground-family-fun/">Adventure Playground</a>, this place is located at the Berkeley Marina. What sets it apart from a regular playground is that it’s made to depict a makeshift playground using scrap materials.</p>



<p>This concept was derived from the ideas of architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Playground_(Berkeley)">Carl Theodor Sorensen</a> who turned junkyards in Copenhagen into playgrounds during World War 2. It is one of the most unique things to do in Berkeley and introduces kids (and adults!) to a cool hands-on learning experience.</p>

<p>Of all the things to do in Berkeley, this one is the most tranquil. Spread across 34 acres on the campus of UC Berkeley, this diverse garden is home to nearly 10,000 different plants from all over the world.</p>



<p>Different sections of the garden are dedicated to the different regions of the world, featuring their prominent as well as lesser-known native plants. It’s a nature lover’s paradise. And, if you like to stop and smell the flowers, you’ll find yourself coming back more than a few times.</p>



<p>Besides its obvious attraction, the <a href="https://botanicalgarden.berkeley.edu/">Botanical Garden</a> is perfect for nature walks and picnics on a sunny day. You can also start your very own home garden with supplies from its garden shop.</p>

<p>Did you know that even non-students can visit the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> campus and just hang out? The campus is more than a place to study for Berkeley’s students and locals &#8211; there’s so much to do! We’re not kidding: nearly half the things to do in Berkeley are on this campus itself.</p>



<p>Relive your college days (part of them, at least) by visiting the UC Berkeley campus and experiencing all the attractions it has to offer. If we’re honest, this one could have been a whole blog in itself &#8211; that’s how vast the campus is.</p>



<p>To begin your exploration of the university, join a campus tour (they happen all the time) or check out <a href="https://www.lawrencehallofscience.org/">The Lawrence Hall of Science</a>. Besides this, there’s so much more you can do. Take a look at the university’s website to get an idea of all the attractions, and start exploring!</p>

<p>There are so many fun things to do in Berkeley, but this one is a local favorite. As one of the oldest parks in the Bay Area, <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/tilden">Tilden Regional Park</a> is a special place for many of the Berkeley residents.</p>



<p>The park features more than 40 miles of hiking trails, an 18-hole golf course, and its very own Botanic Garden. Tilden is also home to Lake Anza, where you can take a dip or practice your swimming skills during spring and summer. It’s also got a mini beach if you’d like to tan!</p>



<p>This is a super-fun place for kids and adults alike, with its antique Merry-Go-Round that’s a sight to see at night. There’s also the Children’s Garden where kids can learn how to plant different kinds of fruits and vegetables. And, if you love farm animals, you’d better check out the Tilden Little Farm where you can play with sheep, goats, pigs, chickens and rabbits.</p>

<p>Did you really think we’d leave this one out, the very thing Berkeley is famous for? The number of theaters and film archives in Berkeley is high, so we decided to club them all into one.</p>



<p><a href="https://thegreekberkeley.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Greek Theatre</a> is the longest-running outdoor amphitheater in America and is still pretty sought-after. It’s a popular place for indie musicians to put on their performances.</p>



<p><a href="https://calperformances.org/visit/venues/zellerbach-hall/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Zellerbach Hall</a> at UC Berkeley is a Cal Performances favorite, where they frequently put up phenomenal performances. Cal Performances is the performing arts organization of UC Berkeley. There’s dance, music, drama — the whole package! Also on campus is the <a href="https://www.berkeleycityclub.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAuP-OBhDqARIsAD4XHpcK57draL5RHJ39ddC_xaUviF1ZMK8JoUG46wYUVAhK2ZIBCpXTqzEaAi3WEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Berkeley City Club</a> where the Central Works Theater presents various plays.</p>



<p>Additionally, if you’re an art and film lover, you’ll want to check out BAMPFA. The <a href="https://bampfa.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive</a> holds over 16,000 films and videos, along with more than 19,000 works of art. The building, originally built in 1939, has seen multiple modern expansions over the years. It now includes film theaters, a café, an art-making lab, a reading room, and so much more!</p>

<p>How awestruck were you by the library Beast gifted Belle in Beauty and the Beast? Well, <a href="https://www.moesbooks.com/">Moe’s Books</a> is that, but real!</p>



<p>It’s a bookstore spanning <em>four floors</em>, with more than 250,000 titles to choose from. The store was founded in 1959 and has been thriving ever since. It’s one of the many independent businesses of Berkeley that don’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon!</p>



<p>Visiting this store is one of the favorite things to do in Berkeley for bookworms, and we can totally see why. To offer something for everyone, Moe’s also holds regular events like indie film screenings.</p>

<p>Sake is a traditional Japanese alcoholic drink that’s found in just about every Japanese household, no matter where they live.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.takarasake.com/visit-us/sake-museum" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Takara Sake Museum</a> is a subset of the Takara Sake USA factory, which is the biggest sake manufacturer in the country. The museum is located inside the factory, where you get to learn all about the Japanese drink, including its history and how it’s made.</p>



<p>You can even taste all the different kinds of sake for a small fee. For a price of just $10, the museum lets you taste 7 different types of sake. So if you do decide to pay this place a visit, make sure you don’t drive!</p>

<p>When they say Everybody, they mean&nbsp;<em>everybody;</em>&nbsp;this well-loved bar not only features a separate space for some live performance but a neat little art gallery tucked in the corner as well.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a new event every day of the week, from burlesque shows and dance parties to comedy shows. With its monthly Romy and Michele&#8217;s Saturday Afternoon Tea Dance party deemed one of the city&#8217;s best gay dance parties, it is no surprise that it is a queer-owned and operated bar.

Grab a drink if you&#8217;re on the run, or enjoy a meal while taking in their shop&#8217;s funky interiors. Their Santa Monica branch also counts as an outdoor coffee shop since it has patio seating. Must-try: their turmeric almond macadamia latte.</p>

<p>Alfred Coffee &amp; Kitchen makes the list of cute restaurants in LA for its Instagrammable interiors.

<p>Cognoscenti Coffee Bar, founded by Yeekai Lim, started as a pop-up in 2009. Its first store opened in 2012 in Culver City, and since then, it&#8217;s expanded with two more locations. You can find them at DTLA South Park and in the Fashion District, too. Loyal customers consider them one of the best coffee shops in LA because of every cup&#8217;s clarity and sustainability. Not everyone&#8217;s into experimental drinks, so Cognoscenti&#8217;s perfect for you if you want your regular, no-nonsense latte, brew, iced tea, or americano. Order for pick-up from any of their branches on their website.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a cause to support, check out Silverback Coffee of Rwanda, founded by Rwandan native Jack Karuletwa. Silverback uses African beans for their roasts and donates to conservation efforts for Rwanda&#8217;s endangered Silverback gorilla. You have to try their cold brew and nitro offerings, and their turmeric ginger latte and lavender fog latte. They have lots of yummy brunch items too, like the chipotle chicken panini and soy chorizo breakfast wrap. It&#8217;s one of those restaurants in LA you&#8217;ll find yourself coming back to. Find them in Echo Park along Sunset Boulevard.</p>

<p>Civil Coffee is one of those cafes in Los Angeles where you can take IG photos all day. They&#8217;ve got an interesting mix of textures: mosaic tile flooring, marble walls, wooden tables, and an industrial-looking facade. The brightly lit interiors and pastries on display make the space totally inviting. Customers keep coming back for their Figueroa, made with cinnamon, espresso, milk, and sweetened condensed milk, topped with a Maria Cookie. Sink your teeth into their chilaquiles, burrito Angelinos, and barbacoa burrito for some hearty grub. &nbsp;If you want to dine al fresco, there&#8217;s a roomy patio in the back.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a reason why people line up outside Intelligentsia Coffee &amp; Tea, one of the best coffee shops in LA. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s one of the pioneers of craft coffee in LA. Which means they know how to make a mean cup of joe. Intelligentsia takes pride in its single-origin coffee from Guatemala, Mexico, and Ethiopia, among others. Try their signature Angeleno drink and black cat espresso. They also have loose leaf teas and milkshakes, making it a perfect pit stop for families. No wonder they&#8217;ve got a massive following of more than 186,000 on IG. They&#8217;ve got five locations in LA alone and six more in Chicago.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you just love beaches? The water, the smooth sand, the great food. There&#8217;s nothing quite like the beach &#8211; whether you&#8217;re there to get active or chill out. There are a lot of things to do in LA, and if you&#8217;re a fan of beaches, you&#8217;ll certainly have a blast in this city. So, if you&#8217;re looking forward to exploring the famous beaches in Los Angeles, or even the quiet beaches, then stick around.</p>

<p>Also a well-known suburban neighborhood, Manhattan Beach is a great choice if you&#8217;re looking for a relaxing place to chill out after a long day. It&#8217;s perfect for soaking up the fresh ocean breeze and taking walks. You can also play your favorite sports here, with beach volleyball being a big pastime for the LA locals.</p>

With fall ending and everyone around you bundling up in layers, you’ve probably got your own winter preparations in mind. However, if you’re moving to LA this winter, your preparation will be a little different from others in the country. Why&#8217;s that? Well, read on for seven things you should know about winter in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles weather overall is uncharacteristically warm because of its sub-tropical climatic conditions. What does that mean for you? If you were moving to LA in the summer, you might’ve had to deal with super-hot temperatures sometimes touching 100°F. That, coupled with the sweat from moving boxes would’ve put you in a very sticky situation (literally)! But luckily for you, sub-tropical climate = mild winter in Los Angeles! Even December, which is the coldest month in Los Angeles, experiences an average low of about 48°F.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-it-can-still-get-warm-in-winter">2. It Can Still Get Warm in Winter</h2>



<p>The winter in Los Angeles lasts from December to March and although it’s usually kind of mild, it can also get very hot because of the Santa Ana wind. Bringing in hot, dry weather, the Los Angeles weather can even go as high as 86°F on the days that this wind blows over the city. Be careful if you live near wooded areas, because these hot winds have been known to trigger fires.</p>

<p>Because of the mild climate experienced in winter in Los Angeles, it’s a top destination for tourists from all over the world! You can expect thronging crowds in all parts of the city, but more so in particular areas that have tourist attractions set up. We’ll explore these attractions some more later in the blog &#8211; there’s something for everyone!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-preparation-for-every-weather-is-key">4. Preparation For Every Weather is Key</h2>



<p>Even though the weather is generally mild and sunny, you can experience some bouts of terrible weather. And by this, we mean heavy rains that could dampen whatever plans you had that day. A coat to keep you warm and dry, and a cup of something hot, should be enough to get you through!</p>

<p>Moving to the city just before winter in Los Angeles? You&#8217;re in luck! Winter is a perfect time to get outdoors and explore the city.</p>



<p>Here are a few things to do while you enjoy the Los Angeles winter weather:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Hike up to Hollywood</strong>: What better way to enjoy the lovely weather than by going on a hike up to the Hollywood Hills? Winter is off season for hikers, so you’ll enjoy a relatively uncrowded trail! The view of the landscape from the top, especially during sunsets, is something to definitely watch out for.</li><li><strong>Visit theme parks</strong>: There are three major theme parks you can enjoy during the winter season. If you’re travelling with a family, you’ve got Disneyland. If you’re the adventurous type, then Six Flags Magic Mountain has a whole bunch of rides for you! And lastly, if you’re in the city of Hollywood, you should definitely go to Universal Studios for the movie-themed rides. Keep in mind that Thanksgiving and Christmas can get busy, but if you can deal with crowds, you’ll get a special treat alongside that fuzzy, holiday feeling!</li><li><strong>Visit the zoo</strong>: The Los Angeles Zoo is one that is renowned all over the world. For three months every year, from November to January, you can experience a magical winter at the zoo. Decorated all Christmassy with lights and animal sculptures, it’s definitely a treat for the senses! The coldest month in Los Angeles will be just a little cozier when you&#8217;re surrounded by families and the warmth of the festive spirit!</li></ul>

<p>Just because it’s going to be mild-weathered during winter, doesn’t mean you can’t visit places around LA to enjoy the holiday spirit! Here’s a short list of places you can hit up:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Pinos</strong> &#8211; Mount Pinos gets several inches of snow every year and is ideal for you if you enjoy snowshoeing and skiing.</li><li><strong>Snow Valley Mountain Resort</strong> &#8211; About an hour away from LA, this resort is a top skiing destination. Less explored than other popular spots, you can enjoy a variety of ski slopes.</li><li><strong>Palm Springs</strong> &#8211; Even during the hot winds of winter, Palm Springs makes a great getaway if you want mild hiking weather. You can also go camping, hiking or fishing!</li><li><strong>Los Angeles Beaches</strong> &#8211; Beaches are a hot destination during the summer months but they&#8217;re perfect for a quiet escape during winter. With few tourists and locals, you can take full advantage of the space!</li><li><strong>Descanso Gardens</strong> &#8211; Visit these beautiful gardens for a unique light display during Christmas!
