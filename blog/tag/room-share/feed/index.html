<p>It’s okay to feel confused on where to start when it comes to shared apartment hunting, especially in NYC. You have all these chaotic stream of questions like “<a href="https://www.instructables.com/Tips-for-Moving-in-New-York-City/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">where to begin</a>? how to find someone to share an apartment? how to be within budget?” and so on. Here, at Roomi, we hear you! So, here’s your go-to guide that answers all questions about a shared apartment, finding your perfect roommate and room share in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is an apartment share?</strong></h2>



<p>A shared apartment is defined as two or more people who live in one permanent rental housing unit. They all are responsible for sharing costs associated with maintaining housing such as rent and utilities. In simple terms, share houses are basically rental places with shared spaces separate from your private room.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why share an apartment?</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s face it, apartments and rooms are expensive in NYC! So, for most people, renting on your own is going to be exorbitant unless you&#8217;re earning megabucks. For many, living with roommates is the best alternative to living somewhere out in the suburbs. That being said, there are plenty of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/rooms" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">opportunities to find affordable</a> shared apartments, and room share possibilities in NYC. After all, living&nbsp;in&nbsp;the city is all about living&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;the city, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Besides, it’s a great way for gathering together to share and exchange in a new way of living, and make amazing friends along the way. Shared apartments have lower initial and monthly costs paralleled to regular rental apartments. This makes life more comfortable as one can live quite reasonably in them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is a shared apartment different from room share?</strong></h3>



<p>A room share is when two friends rent a room from an owner directly. This also is the situation where there are 4 roommates living in a <a href="https://theconversation.com/room-sharing-is-the-new-flat-sharing-84359" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">2-bedroom apartment</a>. This can ruin your privacy unless you’re accustomed to the habits of your roommate.</p>

<p>In the case of shared apartment, often a business manager leases the house by finding residents to oversee and supervise the property. The management, cleaning, and responding to residents&#8217; problems are all the responsibility of the management company so you can live comfortably.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">R<strong>oom/apartment share go easy on the wallet</strong></h3>



<p>One of the room share benefits is that, you&#8217;ll split the cost of the apartment with others. This will bring down the amount you spend on rent, leaving you with more dollars in your pocket to spend on actually living. Not only will your monthly outgoings be lower, but you&#8217;ll also have to worry less about a full security deposit. This would make it easier to secure a room than a shared apartment for rent. Utilities are generally inexpensive when you split the cost with roommates too.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>With shared apartment comes shared living</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re new to a city, living with roommates gives you an instant connection, plugging you into the life of the city. Even in situations when you don&#8217;t have an established network of friends to socialize, shared apartment culture is riveting. In cases where you&#8217;ve already got a social life, you rarely feel like coming home to a silent apartment.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you traverse the net in search of a room share in NYC and potential roommates, you’re going to come across a lot of different styles of ads. Some will be from legit people looking for a good situation. Others . . . not so much. Here is a helpful guide on<a href="https://www.spareroom.co.uk/content/info-tenants/safety-tips-for-room-seekers/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> what to look for</a> in room share ads in NYC, for peaceful co living. Also, you can assess whether the person is for real or up so something shady.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lookout for price points in room share ads  </strong></h2>



<p>Are they reasonable rates, or to good to be true? <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you see low rent for co living in NYC, it can feel like wandering the Sahara desert for forty days and forty nights and stumbling into an oasis. Your heart races, your eyes grow wide, and with a wild whoop of joy, you race towards it, exhaustion forgotten.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in the cartoons, this always turns out to be a mirage. And the over-eager wanderer ends up with a mouthful of sand.</span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="679" data-attachment-id="10985" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/underrated-nyc-neighborhoods/attachment/best-neighborhood-nyc/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1246&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1880,1246" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="best-neighborhood-nyc" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?fit=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=1024%2C679&#038;ssl=1" alt="apartment in NYC" class="wp-image-10985" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1018&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?resize=1200%2C795&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/best-neighborhood-nyc.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, room share in NYC is crazy expensive. But the rates are that high because supply and <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/lc/resources/home/articles/rental-tips-for-first-time-renters" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">demand allow it</a>. With a strong emphasis on demand. New York is so incredibly awesome, so rich in opportunity, that people are willing to pay through the nose to live in one of the greatest cities on Earth.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To end, there are two lessons here, really. One. Don’t wander around deserts without water, a map, and a camel. That’s just science. Two. If someone is posting really low rent for a room share, you should be very, very cautious. There’s a good chance they’re up to no good.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Room Share Ads Details: Quantity Has A Quality All Its Own</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s compare two different room share ads in NYC. One says, “Brooklyn. $1000 a month. Got floors. A window. Thanks.” Okaaay. Clearly, not super detailed. Hopefully, the ceiling is included with this amazing package deal. The other ad has offered lots of helpful info about the lease, stressed the roommate’s co living rules, and added a few free-written paragraphs about the room. Like this </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/rooms-for-rent/Brooklyn/rPQr5w7bZ?source=local" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well written <span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Roomi. Nice! Lot’s more information here.</span></p>

<p>Further, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he obvious advantage is that you can get a better understanding of the room. Similarly, of the co living situation. Yet, there’s a second, less obvious reason to go for the well written room share ad in NYC and avoid the sparse one. The person who wrote a detailed ad was willing to invest their time.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do details in room share ads make co living in NYC better?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone isn’t willing to put in a little effort to write up a complete room share ad, what’s that say about them? Truly, they don’t seem very respectful of your time. They expect you to do all the work which makes finding rooms for co living exhausting. Heck, they may even be hiding something. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would explain why they are treating their room share ad like an interview with the police and offering as little information as possible. Not good signs. So always look for well written, detailed, complete room share ads in NYC that show the individual is honest and willing to put some effort in to make you feel at home.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So ten pictures are worth, like, ten thousand words. Throw in twenty pictures, and we’ve got a novella. If an room share in NYC ad reads well and the price is right, but there aren’t any photos, buyer beware. However, this isn’t to say there needs to be hundreds of photos to qualify as a good room share ad. For instance, there could be five photographs in the room share ad, chosen from helpful angles.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, this determines what your co living life in NYC could look like!</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should get a sense of the entryway, the main room, the bedroom if it has one, bathroom, and kitchen, at the very least. If there are fifty pictures of the main room and not a single one of where you’ll be sleeping, then approach with extreme caution. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe they didn’t take a picture of the bedroom because if they opened the door, all the stacks of pizza boxes and ramen noodles cups would tumble out. Also, the cockroach colony hates that because they labored for days to arrange it all into a miniaturized village.</span> Forget co living, you definitely wouldn&#8217;t want to live there in any way!</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey. It’s New York. Anything could happen.</span> </p>
