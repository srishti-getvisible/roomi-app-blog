<p>As humans, we have a profound need to share our lives with fellow sapiens. If you&#8217;re lucky, living with roommates is one of the best phases of your life. Most of us have had our fair share of both good, bad and even some perfect roommate experiences. While some of us might feel living solo is better, others disagree. Life can certainly be fun with roommates. Before you choose your side, we want to show you some surprising reasons why having an awesome roommate along for the journey of life is truly a blessing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Having an awesome roommate = You always have someone to talk to!</h2>



<p>Good day or lousy day? You will always have someone to hear you out and cheer you up. A roommate can offer a fresh perspective to your current situation. While you might want to burn your ex&#8217;s gifts to ashes, your roommate might offer some creative DIYs to transform those gifts. Now imagine having to deal with a bad day all alone &#8211; doesn&#8217;t sound very appealing, does it?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. You won&#8217;t be cooking for one- we all know how much that sucks!</h2>



<p>Why even bother cooking when peanut butter and jam have all the nutrients to keep one alive? We all know how much it sucks to cook for yourself. It is a tedious process and by the time you&#8217;re done, you don&#8217;t even feel hungry anymore. With a roommate, cooking is always fun &#8211; especially if your roomi is from another country. Hello, delicacies I never knew existed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Your life will turn into a great adventure. Courtesy: your awesome roommate!</h2>



<p>If you live alone, it&#8217;s easy to drop into a boring schedule &#8211; dinner by 9 pm and weekend movie marathons. With a roomi, you invite tons of spontaneity into your otherwise dull schedule <em>(sorry about that assumption, maybe your life is super fun).&nbsp;</em>Midnight runs, photography sessions, stalking your current love interests, and catching up on movies are glimpses of the spontaneity you may be missing, living solo.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. You&#8217;ll feel safe!</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s no doubting the level of comfort, security, and safety you feel when living with a roomi. Especially, if you&#8217;re scared of the dark or theft &#8211; knowing that you&#8217;re not alone is reassuring.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Your expenses are shared!</h2>



<p>Now we are talking! This is a finance hack &#8211; most of your bills are shared, and it takes a load off of your earnings &#8211; from rent, groceries, electricity to Netflix &amp; TV subscriptions. Believe it or not, this is a jackpot, and you&#8217;re in for the gold.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Your roommate may actually become your close friend!</h2>



<p>It could be that you and your roommate were friends before you started living together or became friends after moving in together. Life is always more fun with roommates anyway! Either way, your bond will strengthen over time &#8211; you will be able to confide in them and vice versa. It&#8217;s a beautiful friendship built on trust, companionship, and mutual respect that everyone should get to experience. And what&#8217;s better than living your best life with a perfect roommate/ bestie?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. You always have someone to fall back on!</h2>



<p>Your roommate is your support system!</p>



<p>Lost your key &#8211; thank god for roommates! Feeling low and existential &#8211; press the roommate button! No matter what you need support with, a good roomi, like a good friend, will always be there. Be sure to be there for them when they need you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. You now have an extra pair of helping hands!</h2>



<p>All your chores are divided, so keeping the place looking pristine doesn&#8217;t seem like such hard work. Busy with a meeting? Your roomi will feed/take Pablo for a walk. Your roomi is occupied with her online class &#8211; you offer to do the dishes. It is a give and a take relationship.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. There&#8217;s never a dull day!</h2>



<p>Everyone who has ever had experience living with a roommate will agree to this. Every day may not be different or exhilarating, but it also will never be dull. Having fun with roommates is easy-peasy. You will always have a snack buddy, a yoga partner, a sous chef, a gossip queen, or a silly dance instructor, all wrapped up in one perfect roommate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living with roommates has its pros and cons, but in times like these when you’re stuck inside, it is often easy to focus more on the cons. If you&#8217;re not exactly BFFs with your roomis, it can feel like a challenge to navigate this isolation period &#8211; especially when you have to implement novel social distancing measures in a place that feels smaller by the day. But self-quarantine with your roommate isn&#8217;t as difficult as it may seem in theory.</p>



<p>So now more than ever, there is a need to find the perfect roommate equation till our outside lives resume again.</p>



<p>Here’s our guide to be your best self while you self quarantine with your roommates:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Start by getting to know each other</strong>, of course.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="646" data-attachment-id="1410" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-self-quarantine-with-roommates-without-losing-your-sanity/attachment/roomi-blog1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?fit=500%2C646&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,646" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="friends meme" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?fit=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?fit=500%2C646&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?resize=500%2C646&#038;ssl=1" alt="a collage from the show &quot;Friends&quot;, where the actors who live together as roommates are playing a word guessing game" class="wp-image-1410" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?resize=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1 232w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>When seeing so much of each other while housing in captivity, the best thing you to do is look at the situation in a more positive light. Instead of texting your friends about how hard it is to adjust, or how you wish you were quarantining with them instead, it is time to be friends with your roommate.</p>



<p>Play an ice-breaking game that urges you to confess one negative thing, followed by one positive thing about each other. In your free time, invite them to play board games you all enjoy. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/science-roommate-makes-happier/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crack open a beer and order some tacos, ask them about their lives, and tell them about yours.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learn something new together!</h2>

<p>If you and your roommate share different backgrounds, try learning parts of their language or cooking their favorite family dish. On the other hand, if you’re from the same cultural background, surely there are some things you never bothered to learn about them. Maybe you can finally try to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/sharpen-your-professional-skills-in-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">understand what they do for a living!</a></p>

<p>Take turns to pick out your favorite movie/series while you munch your way through packs of Doritos. You might discover there are more similarities than you thought. Wondering what to watch? <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/7-binge-worthy-netflix-shows-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here are some of our favorite picks of 2020.</a> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Respect each other’s privacy and give each other the gift of personal space.</h2>

<p>The most crucial thing to keep any relationship healthy is to respect each other’s need to be alone. Make arrangements for the other person to know that they don’t want to be disturbed. Make a (friendly!) do not disturb sign or hang a sock at your doorknob. The more you respect each other, the easier it will be to be the perfect roommate!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Cleaning together when you self-quarantine with your roommate!</h2>

<p>Self-quarantine with roommates can be anxiety-inducing for some, but don&#8217;t let those hygiene standards slip! Wash your hands frequently and if you suspect you might be ill, wear a mask when you’re around roommates. Don’t leave a mess after cooking, bathing, or snacking on the couch. Get rid of expired stuff in your pantry and it wouldn&#8217;t hurt you to open a window from time-to-time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Keep the communication <em>open</em> with your roommate.</h2>

<p>While it is always unhealthy, being passive-aggressive might have worked for you before. But right now, communication is key to being the perfect roommate. Keeping your problems to yourself right now can be devastating &#8211; building resentment and destroying your inner peace. Learn how to communicate with your roommates about how their habits affect you. If you’re not keen on confrontation,<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/texts-resolve-common-roommate-conflicts/1157/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> you could use texts to resolve conflicts.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Cut each other’s hair (if you&#8217;re both interested, of course)</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>Remember at the start of quarantine, when everyone was trying to cut their own hair? If you&#8217;re still waiting for your go-to salon to open, why not try it yourself! Let your roomi give you a fun makeover. Embrace the new look and indulge in a photoshoot!</p>
