										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you consider yourself a collector of stuff (even though your roomis might prefer to just call it trash), you&#8217;re probably not concerned about the insects or spiders living within, and you&#8217;ve even started calling them your <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spiderbro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">spider-bros.</a> But what you do have is &#8211; disposophobia! Or in simpler terms, your roomis, friends, and family members call you a hoarder. The thing is, you no longer need to spend your days wondering how to declutter. If you are willing to accept help, we&#8217;re here to guide you through it. The thing is, you don&#8217;t like being called that. You feel attached to these things (like your ex&#8217;s sweater), or maybe you collect them (like egg cartons, waste paper, etc.) to repurpose and make something out of them on DIY weekends.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let&#8217;s talk about hoarding for a second.</h2>



<p>If you relate to this, you&#8217;ll probably find some consolation in knowing about geniuses who were hardcore hoarders. From <a href="https://vimeo.com/19378813" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s boxes</a> to <a href="https://www.faena.com/aleph/articles/the-adorable-eccentricities-of-composer-erik-satie/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Erik Satie&#8217;s love for umbrellas</a> shows the love of hoarding and the value it offers to the creative process.</p>



<p>More often than not, you continue to hoard because you enjoy it, and it gives you happiness to add another item to your collection now and then. Stamp and coin collectors are often appreciated, even respected. But if you are a collector of egg cartons or fallen twigs and leaves, you become a compulsive hoarder? Life isn&#8217;t fair.</p>



<p>But then one day, you might look at the stuff you hoard and think &#8211; &#8216;Am I EVER going to use that?&#8217; &#8216;Or is it adding even a little value to my life?&#8217; and thought of decluttering might enter your mind.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/i.pinimg.com/originals/24/32/3f/24323f74b4730ee2987ed4a1647d30f3.jpg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="a meme on what hoarders are like, and how to declutter"/></figure>



<p>One of the facets of compulsive hoarding is that you refuse to declutter and throw the stuff out, but instead, you organize and keep them in neat little labeled boxes, making it even harder to recognize that this might be a problem.</p>

<p>But when that doubt does arise, don&#8217;t ignore it. Get rid of some stuff, slowly but steadily, and make space in your home and life for the things you do need.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Take baby steps to declutter</h2>



<p>When stuff is lying around your house, you can do nothing but take baby steps. So take the metaphorical baby steps to stop being a hoarder. The first of many is: deep clean your apartment and find all the things you like to hoard. Make it fun by inviting your roomis to join in for a hoarder&#8217;s treasure hunt! As and when you find the little treasures, think about the objects that add little or no value to you. Think about which items might be compromising your hygiene and health, and say your final goodbyes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Donate your riches</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re the kind of hoarder that collects useful items like clothes, shoes, books, stationery, etc. but never use it, consider donating your riches. Many people can make use of the stuff you don&#8217;t use. Find organizations that look for donations and get rid of things with zero guilt of throwing stuff away. Once you know they&#8217;re going to the right place and might help people in need, de-cluttering and de-hoarding will become much more comfortable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Find your support group</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to give up your identity as a hoarder but are too emotionally attached to your treasures, ask a roomi, friend, or family member to help. Show them your collection and tell them to get rid of things that they think are completely useless and have never seen you use. We understand that this can be a bit invasive, but if you&#8217;re willing to get help, you will realize that most of the stuff isn&#8217;t as important as you thought.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. What makes you emotionally attached?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re holding onto an object that reminds you of something in your life, think about whether it&#8217;s good times you&#8217;re remembering or an event that you need to let go of. For instance, if you&#8217;re holding on to a grade card or encouraging note from a teacher or a friend, that&#8217;s great, and maybe you can put the best one on display and throw the rest out to declutter. On the other hand, if it&#8217;s an ex&#8217;s t-shirt or airplane tickets from a trip with your ex, you NEED to throw them out. Whether good or bad, that phase of your life is gone. And you need to let go of things that keep you stuck in time.</p>

<p>Is that paper piled desk or &#8216;the chair&#8217; where you dump your laundry giving you nightmares? When does mess turn into slob behavior? If you know someone who collects a lot of things with little or no value, and if your roommate is a hoarder, we&#8217;ve got something for you.</p>



<p>Real hoarding is different from clutter. Hoarding has severe traits of mental illness, and shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly or masked as laziness. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If your roommate is just a slob, that&#8217;s another story entirely,</a> but with a real hoarder, you need to proceed with caution.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Lee&#8217;s experience &#8211; Buried in Treasures</em></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/compulsive-hoarding-live-chat/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scientific American</a> came out with the story of one hoarder named Lee Shuer, who got help and then later created a program called &#8220;Buried in Treasures.&#8221; His hoarding started in his youth, even as he moved from place to place. It became acute after college when he began aiming at acquisitions from the Salvation Army, Goodwill, and tag stores. During workdays, he would prioritize visiting a thrift store rather than eating lunch during his afternoon breaks.</p>



<p>Lee found help through his wife and he slowly learned to catch himself in the act of acquiring something he didn&#8217;t need. He learned to challenge his beliefs about the value of his possessions and paid attention to space at home. He gradually learned to get rid of things he didn&#8217;t need without mourning their loss.</p>



<p>Lee went on to co-found The Buried in Treasures program, which also turned into the book &#8220;Buried in Treasures.&#8221; The book has led the way for organized support groups of people with problematic hoarding tendencies, especially ones who cannot afford one-on-one therapy.</p>



<p>It is crucial to know that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/hoarding/Pages/Introduction.aspx#profile" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">people dealing with hoarding</a>&nbsp;have to treat their underlying mental health issues, and not just tidy up the place. If you are helping a friend work through their problems with hoarding, it may just be too much to handle on your own.</p>



<p>The primary treatment for hoarding disorder is cognitive-behavioral therapy. If they have anxiety or depression, then prescriptions of medicines can be sought.</p>



<p>There are five key signs of hoarding that you should keep an eye out for when you suspect your roommate is achieving hoarder status.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The emotional attachment that comes with hoarding.</h2>



<p>Even though hoarders may be requested to clear their stuff by anyone from landlords to roommates, they will most likely react with extreme, aggressive, or emotional reactions that are out of proportion to the request. Hoarders will either avoid the issue or respond with dismissiveness or overt anger. Their emotional attachment with &#8216;things&#8217; will not let them discard anything. And their slob behaviour might interfere with your days as well as theirs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Your hoarder roommate might be collecting useless treasure.</h2>



<p>Most collected items will seem strange or useless to strangers &#8211; worse than having a garage in their bedrooms! This aspect separates hoarders from collectors. Right from old magazines to expired canned food, much of it will seem to have no apparent use. And their slob-like traits might start taking over both your days. According to the International OCD Foundation, hoarders may also&nbsp;<a href="https://iocdf.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hoarding-Fact-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">develop a sense that inanimate objects have their own</a>&nbsp;emotions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;I&#8217;m a collector,!&#8221; says my hoarder roommate.</h2>



<p>While collectors may organize their belongings, hoarders will keep disarray of their rooms, and things will just pile up. They often feel like they are collectors and will try to convince you to believe that as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hoarders and private space</h2>



<p>Hoarders tend to meet people outside their homes &#8211; this is a sign to keep in mind. They become reclusive and feel threatened when someone enters their private space. It&#8217;s very challenging to treat hoarders since they don&#8217;t accept hoarding as a problem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Added emotional value to hoarded items.</h2>



<p>The Clinician&#8217;s Guide To Severe Hoarding mentions that one of the most prominent symptoms of hoarding behavior is &#8220;overvalued ideation.&#8221; Hoarders ascribe logic to acquiring possessions by giving objects massive sentimental weight or believing that they &#8220;may be useful someday.&#8221; The Clinician&#8217;s Guide says that a hoarder develops &#8220;inflated responsibility,&#8221; They think that they are the only ones responsible for deciding to keep or discard items, which paralyzes them.</p>



<p>Hoarding can also accompany a fear of contaminating or harming others â€“ if they abandon their belongings. They also get superstitious with an unreasonable belief that throwing something away will result in a catastrophe of some kind.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-live-life-to-the-fullest-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The best way to deal with this is to approach the problem with empathy</a>. Focus on the person compared to the &#8216;stuff.&#8217; Be there and set achievable goals, and help your roommate find professional help if they need it.</p>
