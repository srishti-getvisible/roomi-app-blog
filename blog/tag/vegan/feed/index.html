<p>You just moved into your apartment, and everything’s pretty swell. You and your roommate are <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-bonding-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting along great</a> and making plans left and right. You’ll watch Netflix together, go to the gym together, and cook together! Then you remember: You co live with a vegan roommate or a vegetarian roommate.</p>



<p>Before you freak out about giving up your meat and leather goods, take a step back. These days it’s&nbsp;not uncommon to co live&nbsp;with someone whose lifestyle is drastically different to yours. Veganism has gained immense popularity over the last few years. So if you find&nbsp;yourself trying to balance a delicate carnivore/herbivore relationship with your vegan roommate, don’t worry! You’re not alone. We talked to the experts for some&nbsp;tips on living with a vegan roommate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Get the facts right about your vegan roommate </h2>



<p>A <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.vegan.com/what/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegan</a>&nbsp;is someone who avoids consuming or buying animal products. This includes animal flesh (red meat, chicken, fish), dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese, butter), eggs. And other animal-derived products (fur, wool, leather, fish oil, honey, etc.). Some vegans are more strict than others. But you should find out what your vegan roommate or vegetarian roommate personally avoids eating or drinking. And make sure you ask how they feel about cross-contamination.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“While it’s pretty clear that animals are non-vegan, there can be things hiding in foods, such as broth, milk, cream, cheese and butter,” says&nbsp;<a href="http://sharonpalmer.com/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharon Palmer</a>, a&nbsp;registered dietitian and plant-based nutrition expert and author.</p>



<p>“Choose a margarine brand that is dairy-free. Use egg-free mayo and salad dressings, and breads that are vegan. You can also try soy or almond milk instead of dairy milk if you are worried about sharing food.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many vegans also have strong beliefs about harming animals in any way. So pest control can become a conflict in a co-living situation with a vegan roommate. New York City tenant Lauren Paulauskas experienced this first-hand with her vegan roommate. She suggests addressing pest control and lifestyle beliefs during initial roommate discussions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“You should be on the same page when it comes to how you will get rid of mice, cockroaches, etc.,” she says. “We had a period when we had mice. And she had to be okay with us choosing to protect the food we purchased over the mice’s lives,” she says.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Be&nbsp;open minded</h2>



<p>When you’re living with a vegan roommate or a vegetarian roommate with different beliefs, it’s important both parties are willing to be&nbsp;flexible to each other’s lifestyle choices, even if they change.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I had already begun living with my future wife before I made the decision to turn vegan,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/pvptowers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Paul Tower</a>, a triathlete and tech entrepreneur. “So it&nbsp;came as quite a shock to my friends and family.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As as result of his own experience, he&nbsp;stresses the importance of allowing time for someone to adjust,&nbsp;no matter what side of the issue you’re on.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Don’t jump in and start making tofu burgers for your roommate on day one,” he says. “While you may be extremely interested to try out the new tofu and mayonnaise recipe you discovered, they probably won’t be.</p>



<p>“Over time, however, you’ll find that they’ll start sharing meals or asking to try things. If you want to find food that is easy to bond over, try some great vegan cookies or chocolate. Hardly anyone can turn down a chocolate cookie, whether it’s vegan or not.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Have a system for living with your vegan roommate</h2>



<p>Before you begin living with a vegan roommate or a vegetarian roommate, be sure to define expectations for the relationship. Will you be cooking together? What things will you share? What will you keep separate? One easy fix many cohabiters suggest is having two sets of all kitchen utensils.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“There was an unfortunate evening when my roommate got sick because a pan hadn’t been cleaned very well after cooking meat,” Ysmay Walsh, founder of <a href="http://www.42yogis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42 Yogis</a>, recalls. “To ensure it didn’t happen again, we went out and bought another set of cookware and another set of dishes.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Though she’s the vegan roommate now, having been the meat-eating roommate previously gives Ysmay particular insight into vegan/non-vegan living, and she promises that it can be done with some planning.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We would each have a shelf of the kitchen, with meat on the very bottom. That meant the vegetable crisper was used for beverages and products in sealed containers instead of vegetables so they would not be contaminated should the meat package leak,” she says.</p>



<p>“We also each had a separate time to cook — first him, then me, so that nothing became contaminated while we were moving around.”</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Plenty of things you eat on a day-to-day basis are vegan, and numerous dinners can easily become vegan without too much effort. My wife comes from an Italian background and many of their soups, pastas and bean dishes are vegan to begin with.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Be respectful </h2>



<p>Whether you’re cooking meals together or not, the most important thing is to be considerate of the other person’s choices when you live with a vegan roommate. Everyone wants to feel supported and comfortable in their own home, so simply listening and respecting someone’s decisions — even if they’re different to yours — can go a long way.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“One of the most important things when you&#8217;re a vegan is to feel that there is a sense of community. And that people are being understood and that people ‘get’ you,” Palmer advises.</p>



<p>“So, being understanding and supportive of your roommate is a wonderful thing you can do.”</p>
