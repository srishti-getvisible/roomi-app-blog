<p>Cycling may be your eco-friendly choice for transportation, but storing them can be quite challenging. Not sure how you can store a bike in an apartment? Here’s what you need to know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Can You Store a Bike in an Apartment?</h2>



<p>Apart from being an eco-friendly way to get around the city, cycling every day can help you get some fresh air and is a <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits#:~:text=Regular%20cycling%20stimulates%20and%20improves,and%20reduces%20blood%20fat%20levels.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">good way to exercise</a>. However, storing your bike can be difficult, especially if you live in a small apartment. Storing your bike outside is not an ideal solution, even if your building has dedicated areas for bicycles. Keeping your bicycle outside exposes it to weather elements that reduce the longevity of your precious ride.</p>



<p>So, what can you do when you have a small apartment and like to cycle regularly? Well, you have to get creative with how you store your bike in your apartment. From buying bike racks for small apartments, to hanging your bike on your wall, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/iFFas72-dTY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remember Me</a> style, there’s a lot you can do with them! We’ve curated a list of creative, yet practical ways you can store a bike in an apartment to help you get started.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Classic Option: Hang it on the Wall</h2>



<p>The easiest way to store your bicycle in a small apartment without sacrificing your storage or floor place is to hang it on the wall. To mount your bike on a wall you can use simple hooks, or those that are designed for heavier bikes.</p>



<p>Some bike racks are designed for small apartments and allow you to hang up your bike to get it off the floor. Such bike racks help you hang your bike vertically, making it look unique and artistic, rather than a nifty way to save some space.</p>



<p>Mounting the bike on your wall can give your apartment a rustic feel, or you can hang coordinated paintings around it to make it feel like a part of the décor!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Use Your Storage</h2>



<p>If you do not mind sacrificing some storage space, then keeping your bicycle stashed away in your storage cupboard will do the trick. Storing your bicycle away in your storage cupboard frees up your space, without ruining the aesthetics of your apartment. If you’re planning on ditching your cycle <a href="https://www.welovecycling.com/wide/2019/11/01/how-to-store-the-bike-away-for-the-winter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the season</a>, this is the ideal way to store your cycle for the upcoming months.</p>



<p>Tuck your bike behind your coat to ensure that it is well out of sight. Placing it flush along the wall of your cupboard ensures it does not take up too much space. There is no special equipment needed for this method, and it is usually fairly easy to take your bike out when you think it is time to ride it again.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hiding in Plain Sight: Make it a Part of Your Décor!</h2>



<p>Apart from using bike wall mounts, you can also include your bike in any room as a part of the décor. For this, you can either add bike racks which can hold multiple bikes, or simply arrange it in any space to make it look more filled out. Coordinate the colors in the room to match your bike and make it seem cohesive. Now, no one will be able to tell that it wasn’t meant to be there in the first place!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Peek-a-boo: Tuck it Behind Furniture</h2>



<p>Have a long sofa or a couch that takes up a lot of space? Well, if it is big enough you can simply tuck your bike behind the furniture to store it there. It is a simple and convenient way to store a bike in an apartment at no extra cost. If you don’t think bike racks for your small apartment are worth the investment, hiding it behind furniture may be the best choice for you. Your guests wouldn’t spot it, and you won’t have to worry about arranging extra space for your bike.</p>



<p>If your apartment has a laundry room, you can also tuck your bike between your washer and dryer to keep it out of the way. This is an age old, tried and tested method, that is inexpensive but effective.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Bike Under the Stairs: Create a Nook for It</h2>



<p>If you love to bike and do it frequently enough, you will have some equipment to go along with it as well. Why not opt for a bike dock in your apartment? Bike docks are user-friendly and easy to install below your stairs. With these docks, you can create a nook for your bike and store your gear neatly in one place. For those who have <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cycling-accessories/">a lot of biking equipment</a> which cannot be hidden away easily, getting a dock is a great choice. If you are renting your apartment, ensure that you check in with your landlord, or your lease to ensure that you can store your bike below your stairs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Outside Your Home: Store It in Your Balcony or Porch</h2>



<p>If you have a balcony or a porch, you can easily store your bike there. Although you may need to check with your landlord if you’re renting; keeping your bike right outside your home ensures that it is safe and out of the way. It is easy to take your bike in and out when it is in your balcony, and ensures that you do not have to sacrifice any storage space!</p>

<p>Look around you and, tell us what do you see? An avalanche pile of clothes, toiletries, scattered books, a glaring roomi? If your answer is yes, then you need some serious organizing. Hence, here are our top 7 storage hacks will help you organize your mess and make your roomi go from ? to ?.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Drawer organizers</h2>



<p>If you have a bedside table, then you must be familiar with the way it works. Firstly, open the drawer and put away things you don&#8217;t need &#8211; chargers, pens, books, face masks, that person you don&#8217;t like, glasses, and toiletries. Chances are that when you do need any of these things, you won&#8217;t find them.</p>



<p>Bin there done that!</p>



<p>But, my friend, things are about to change; this &#8216;drawer organizing&#8217; storage hack uses <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://makeitorfixit.com/homemade-sock-drawer-divider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardboard</a> and empty cereal boxes. How cool is that? You can decorate them like Jonathon Fong does or leave it at its most original carboard-y look. It&#8217;s totally up to how lazy you&#8217;re feeling today!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Hide the cleaning supplies(one of the best storage hacks to store cleaning supplies!)</h2>



<p>Your broom is not the Nimbus 2000, please put it away. Undoubtedly, the <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/organizing/g3366/how-to-organize-your-cleaning-supplies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best way to store your cleaning supplies</a> is to either put it in a tall closet! Additionally, use hooks to hang it neatly behind the door or on a spare wall.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Vertical shelves</h2>



<p>This shelving method works really well with books and magazines! Moreover, it is an ingenious way to add extra color while organizing those stubborn stacks. The trick is to paint the shelves in the color of the wall, which makes it look super tidy. Don&#8217;t take our word for it &#8211; go crazy and experiment with colors. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Trash is storage treasure</h2>



<p>Use old drawers, bins, and baskets instead, use them to store things in your home! Like wire baskets, big cardboard delivery boxes(after a little redecorating with cute paper), or wooden crates that you were thinking of throwing away. Give trash a new meaning! Not to mention, almost all things can be used again. Indeed a great storage hack to store cleaning supplies, groceries etc. Here&#8217;s how <a href="https://decordemon.blogspot.com/2018/03/a-fresh-modern-farmhouse-by-leanne-ford.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leanne Ford uses baskets and crates &#8211; we are in love!</a></p>

By doing this, you can reset your life and embark on a new lifestyle.&#8221; &#8220;The best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one&#8217;s hand and ask: &#8220;Does this spark joy?&#8221; If it does, keep it. </em></p><cite><em>~ Marie Kondo</em></cite></blockquote>
