<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding rooms for rent in Oakland</h2>



<p>Oakland has varied terrain, with a total area of 77.89 sq mi. There are more than <a href="https://youtu.be/hMp18y9sGZQ" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 distinct neighborhoods</a> and each of them can be quite unique. Locals refer to the city&#8217;s area as &#8220;the flatlands&#8221;, and &#8220;the hills&#8221;, which were the more affluent areas. A lot of Oakland has been through rapid gentrification in recent times. Big companies have continued to transform the communities and culture of Oakland. Hence, modern apartments have appeared, making it harder to find cheap rooms for rent in Oakland.</p>
