<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of opportunities out there to help you find a roommate through apps. Choosing the right one is a bit like picking between the same job at different companies. While the core functionality remains the same, each has different perks and benefits. It’s the same way when searching s</span>pecifically <span style="font-weight: 400;">for a &#8216;find a roommate&#8217; app. Here’s a comparative list of benefits for different roommate finder apps out there, ordered from the fewest to the most.</span></p>

It has the</span> option<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8216;find roommate&#8217;</span> in the<span style="font-weight: 400;"> app. There are some</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">basic posting guidelines that people have to follow. But outside of that, posters have a lot of freedom in how they write their ads. This leads to a lot of diversity in posting style, which can be a bit confusing and make room-to-room comparisons a trial. Unfortunately, it also has a reputation for being a haven for scammers, shady brokers, and other undesirables.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rent.com/cheap-apartments-for-rent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Rent.com</a> isn’t flashy, but its best benefit is that it’s straightforward to use. A quick filter menu at the top lets you set things like minimum and maximum price, pop in the neighborhood, and off you go. If you want more filters, you can add them in this room finder app. The interface gives you a scrolling option of whatever fits your filters, or you can jump over to the map view and select things based on location. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it doesn’t let you find roommate in </span>this<span style="font-weight: 400;"> app, so you’re still stuck there. And while each listing has some very basic neighborhood info, it doesn’t really help you get to know the area before you decide to move in.</span></p>

The listings update quickly and smoothly, which is a nice perk for large scale searches while finding a room. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two major drawbacks though. One, this app doesn’t help you find a roommate. Two, it’s built for more national and state level searches. The renter&#8217;s advice on the blog is quite good but very general. The local guides offer nice overviews of a city or neighborhood but don’t get into many specifics and don’t update often.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splitting utilities with roommates should no longer be a cause for concern. With so many resources to be utilized, it’s really hard to get it wrong. Here are a few tips, tricks, and apps to help you split utilities and navigate your way through fair sharing</span>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There&#8217;s always an app to save you.</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to splitting utilities with roommates, precision is of utmost importance. A calculator and dry-erase board leave too much room for human error and discrepancy. Here are a couple apps that are designed to help equally and fairly split costs and bills including utilities. Splitwise is a free mobile app that allows you to keep tabs. Everyone in a “group” can see the running tab of who owes who and how much. It&#8217;s great at maintaining accountability. </span></p>



<p><a href="https://venmo.com/about/product/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venmo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows easy transferring of money amongst roommates. Some banks even have mobile apps that will allow money transfer at your fingertips. An electronic receipt helps record who spent what and when.</span></p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-tell-roommates-moving-out/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Moving Out When You&#8217;re In A Roommate Agreement</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It&#8217;s important to discuss every factor when considering how roommates must split utilities.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.pexels.com/photos/4009777/pexels-photo-4009777.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="two people in an apartment, at home, discussing how as roommates they should split utilities"/></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before everyone starts downloading apps it’s vital to discuss the position of all roommates. Just as everyone decided the person in the largest room with a view pays a little more rent than the person sleeping in the walk-in closet, fairness is applied to the utilities. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one roommate needs 3,000 television channels and another hasn’t had a TV in a decade, adjustments need to be discussed. Timing is important. These conversations need to be had right away, not when the late notice is slid under the door. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, that one person who turns the AC down to 65 in the middle of the night- don’t let him get away with it. That energy consumption comes at a price.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Determine and distribute</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determine how and when payments are to be made and who is responsible for that particular utility. This should be evenly distributed. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leader or control freak of the group may insist she make all the payments, avoid this. Someone take the internet, the other electric, etc. This person is responsible for collecting everyone&#8217;s share and submitting payment.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Come to an agreement and type it out.</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all roommates agree on how utilities will be split get it in writing. Type out all the details, big and small, and have everyone sign the roommate agreement. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And no, this will only prevent problems. All roommates keep a copy and one posted on the fridge. Leave no excuses for when bills are due.</span></p>

<p>Finding a roommate is hard, but it pales in comparison to the daunting task of getting to know them. Depending on the length of your lease, you may be forking over a year of your life to this person. Living in the same <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/decluttering-101-to-be-or-not-to-be-messy/">home</a>, sharing good times, laughs, but also stress, bills, and responsibilities. Even if you’re a private person, your life will inevitably seep over into your roommate’s existence, and vice versa. Since getting to know your roommate is super critical to a healthy, happy living situation, you need to choose the best approach to get to know a prospective roommate as thoroughly as possible before the pen hits the paper and you’re locked in. Using a roommate finder app on your phone has a lot of advantages.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background wp-block-heading"><strong>The Benefits of a Roommate Finder App</strong>!</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#1</strong> <strong>You can text people in a natural setting with a roommate finder app</strong></h3>



<p>When people are at home, at the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/frugal-living-how-to-get-groceries-on-a-budget-in-nyc/">grocery store</a>, or waiting for a bus, they are more relaxed. More themselves. Interviewing face-to-face tends to create the infamous “interview honeymoon” scenario. When a company interviews a potential employee, they are on their best behavior. With a polished, toothy grin, they assure you everything is just so great! And the interviewee is also on their best behavior. They nod enthusiastically, yes, yes, everything is wonderful! Nobody wants to even begin a conversation that might allude to something negative three questions down the road. </p>



<p>It’s like politically correct chess, always thinking a few moves ahead. Then, work starts and the employee realizes everyone is, in fact, miserable there and the company realizes the employee thinks 9-5 is for chumps. (And seriously, who works 9-5 anymore? More like 7-7.) So use intermittent text messaging through a secure roommate finder app like Roomi to get a more realistic feel for who your roommate is by catching them in natural settings.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#2 Get to know roommates just like you would anyone else</strong></h3>



<p>Pretty common scenario: you meet someone for the first time. They seem cool. You exchange numbers and text each other for a while before you actually do anything together. It’s a great system. You get to know them a little at a time, do you best to filter out the weirdos, and by the time you actually hang out, you’ve got a feel for who this person is. So why should getting to know a roommate be any different? If it’s because you’re slammed for time, that sucks. But to help out, <a href="https://roomiapp.com/">roomiapp.com</a> has lots of expert blog posts on moving strategies so you can avoid that in the future, and find great roommates too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#3 Catch people in different moods and modes</strong></h3>



<p>Have you ever met someone, then described them to a friend as really happy-go-lucky? Then your friend wrinkles their nose in confusion and says, “Wait, that guy? I know that guy, and he’s a total <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/coliving-101-help-my-roommate-is-really-creepy/">jerk</a>!” And then either you or your friend find out that you just happened to catch them during an off-moment and got a totally off-kilter impression. Roomi lets you get to know someone over time, and you’re bound to catch a few different moods and get a sense of how they handle different scenarios. When their car <a href="https://www.allstate.com/tr/car-insurance/what-to-do-when-car-breaks-down.aspx" class="broken_link">breaks down</a>, do they laugh about it, or send a tire iron through the nearest window? (Statistically speaking, the nearest window is liable to be their own, so hey. Not super smart dude.)</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background wp-block-heading"><strong>The Conveniences of a Roommate Finder App</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#1 It works better for your schedule</strong></h3>



<p> Your life is busy. You’ve got some unfathomably <a href="https://www.snagajob.com/blog/post/balancing-a-busy-schedule" class="broken_link">hectic</a> combination of work, a social life, school, and family. Taking an hour out of your day to sit down and do an interview with someone, especially if you have to drive, is tough to fit in. An app will make life so much easier because you can use it anytime, anywhere.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#2 You’ve got a log you can go over later</strong></h3>



<p> We’ve all a moment where we were in a fantastically good mood and, as a result, let our guard down or made a bad call. If you are really excited over talking to your new roommate, then great! But did you misinterpret anything? Are there questions you forgot to ask? Do yourself a favor and go over it all again when you’re feeling a little more level headed, just to be sure. Have you ever gotten the wrong impression of a roommate? What happened to change your opinion? Post your comments below.</p>
