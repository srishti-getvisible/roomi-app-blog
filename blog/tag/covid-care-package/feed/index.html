<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <a href="https://www.1800flowers.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">1800-Flowers</a></h2>



<p>We could all do with a little more color in our lives, and when you’re looking for a care package for a friend, a blooming gift is sure to make them smile. But it doesn’t stop at flowers. 1800-Flowers also has a variety of other things your friends and family will love; from gifts in baskets, care packages, wine, plants, and gourmet chocolate-covered strawberries! However, bouquets are where they specialize; the family behind 1800-Flowers has been selling flowers since 1976!</p>



<p>1800-Flowers offers same-day delivery in the U.S. &#8211; handy even if you forgot a friend’s birthday.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=care+package&amp;ascsubtag=4785137%2C2%2C18%2Cmobile_web%2C1%2C0%2C0%2C%2C%2Cd%2C%2C%2Csemrush.co%2C923%3A2%2C0%2C0&amp;linkCode=gs3&amp;tag=buzz0c-21&amp;ref=sr_nr_p_72_0" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Amazon Care Package</a></h2>



<p>What did we do before Amazon brought absolute convenience to our lives? (Last minute rushes to the store, probably.) Now, you can order an Amazon care package to just about anyone, anywhere &#8211; just to let them know you’re thinking about them.</p>



<p>From kid-friendly snack boxes to adult treats and pamper packages, a quarantine care package from Amazon is a treat for the entire family. Thinking of gifts for your family during a quarantine Christmas? Amazon&#8217;s got you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <a href="https://www.cratejoy.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cratejoy</a></h2>



<p>The super pretty website from Cratejoy makes giving a gift just as fun as receiving one. And, because no one knows your bestie quite as well as you do, there is a handy variety of categories to choose from. This includes beauty, books, gaming, home and living, food, kids, health and fitness, and arts and culture!</p>



<p>Cratejoy is all about creating subscription boxes for everyone. That means your gift doesn’t have to be a one-off; you can keep your favorite person smiling month after month!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <a href="https://shopboxfox.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">BOXFOX</a></h2>



<p>Personalization is the key with BOXFOX. Your go-to place when you want a custom care package for that special someone, BOXFOX feels like they’ve found that perfect balance between a premium product and a simplified ordering system.</p>



<p>Choose from pre-curated boxes or create your own custom gift from a selection of items, to build the gift that suits your recipient to a tee. You won’t see a hint of tacky packaging here, either &#8211; just sleek, stylish boxes that are a thrill to receive (and give!)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. <a href="https://happyboxstore.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Happy Box Store</a></h2>



<p>Happy Box Store is proudly a female-run startup, born when one of its founders wanted to send her recently-dumped sister a fun gift that would make her smile. She found that running around different stores and waiting in line at the post office kind of ruined the experience, so went on to build Happy Box Store, to make creating care packages for friends convenient, easy, and fun.</p>



<p>Select from corporate gifts (because your clients and employees need some love, too), pre-curated boxes, or build your own custom care package. With a number of cute designs available, receiving one of these deliveries is sure to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/gifting-ideas-for-the-babe-on-a-budget-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make quarantine a little sweeter.</a></p>
