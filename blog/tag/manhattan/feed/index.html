<p>Whether you&#8217;ve just <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-manhattan/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> to Manhattan, or you&#8217;re planning a visit, Room is on-hand to help you explore things to do in Lower East Side!</p>



<p>Occasionally abbreviated as LES and known in Spanish as Loisaida, this is the region linking Bowery and the East River. LES falls under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Community_Board_3" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Manhattan Community Board 3</a>, comprising Alphabet City, East Village, Two Bridges, and Chinatown. It&#8217;s also the oldest neighborhood in the southern-eastern Manhattan borough, NYC. Back in 2008, the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed it as one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Most_Endangered_Places" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">America&#8217;s Most Endangered Places</a>.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s just one of the reasons we recommend you visit some parks and museums in Lower East Side; the other reason is they are beautiful! Today, LES is famous for its bars and restaurants, arts and culture, and vibrant nightlife scene. With this in mind, we&#8217;ve listed some restaurants in Lower East Side that&#8217;d be hard to find anywhere else.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve curated exciting things to do in Lower East Side for you to discover. We&#8217;ll begin with outdoorsy activities and end with thrilling events. Read on to learn more.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-outdoor-activities-in-lower-east-side">Outdoor Activities in Lower East Side</h2>



<p>Formerly, during its past years, LES had no open public recreational spaces for the many Eastern European immigrants arriving here. Nowadays, that&#8217;s all changed, and you&#8217;ll find plenty of beautiful natural spaces. So, after arriving in Lower East Side, be sure to stop and enjoy the parks.</p>

<p>Visit the first municipal public playground built in the US, which is now a historical landmark. Seaward Park has walking paths, a children&#8217;s playground, and volleyball and basketball courts. Enjoy a snack and stroll around this public recreational space in LES. If you walk in at the right time, you might find a group of people practicing T&#8217;ai Chi, a popular form of exercise regularly practiced by LES denizens &#8211; one of the things to do in Lower East Side.</p>

<p>Be sure to visit the John V. Lindsay East River Park for its noticeable views of New York&#8217;s harbor, one of our favorite things to do in LES. It lies along the Loisaida waterfront, with Williamsburg Bridge cleaving the park. You&#8217;ll find fields and courts dedicated to soccer, football, baseball, softball, and basketball, including a tennis complex and a track.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sports-in-lower-east-side">Sports in Lower East Side</h2>



<p>Sports stadia aren&#8217;t readily available in LES to attend uproarious game events like in other NYC locations. But that&#8217;s not to say people here aren&#8217;t conscious about recreational activities in order to keep fit and have fun.</p>

<p>As we mentioned before, one of the things to do in Lower East Side is to get to know the popular T&#8217;ai Chi form. Local communities understand the importance of regular physical activities that keep the mind and body right. So, in LES, T&#8217;ai Chi is a popular activity to learn, and meet new people at the same time.</p>

<p>Lastly in the list of outdoors and sports activities, check out the Manny Cantor Center. Here, you&#8217;ll find the LES community&#8217;s fitness enthusiasts breaking into a sweat. Besides fitness, it has other wellness-related things to do in the neighborhood, like art classes, community volunteer programs, and workshops. It&#8217;s also a great place to meet like-minded people.</p>

<p>Almost as exciting as the displays inside the museum is the story of how the Rubin’s Museum, which has a massive collection of art and photography works from the Himalayas, came to be. Shelley and Donald Rubin, the founders of the Rubin Museum, began collecting art in the 1970s when they fell in love with a Himalayan art piece they had seen in the window of a gallery. As their collection grew, the museum was born, purely out of their love for the art produced by Himalayan artists.</p>

<p>Hearing about the tragic 9/11 is very different when you hear about it through the experiences of the victims and their families. The museum has a collection of times, photographs, videos and artifacts recovered from the site, along with audio tapes from families recalling the incident recorded in four languages. At the Ground Zero Museum Workshop, you get a whole new perspective on the terrorist attack, the recovery period, and what exactly happened at Ground Zero on September 11th, 2001. It is one of the must visit places in Chelsea, NYC.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability</h3>



<p>This neighborhood is the 20th <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/NY/New_York/Upper_East_Side" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">most walkable</a> neighborhood in NYC with a Walk Score of 99. It&#8217;s known as a pedestrian&#8217;s paradise! When you live here, your daily errands don&#8217;t require a car as you can easily get them done by foot.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Roads &amp; Traffic</h3>



<p>The Upper East Side can feel far away from the rest of the city, so you might be surprised by the beauty of this quiet neighborhood. The neighborhood&#8217;s north-south avenues are Fifth, Madison, Park, Lexington, Third, Second, First, York, and East End Avenues. The important east-west streets are 59th Street, 72nd Street, 79th Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street. Taxis represent a major component of the traffic stream and account for about 50% of the total traffic volume.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Nearby Train Stations</h3>



<p>Being familiar with <a href="https://williambolls.com/the-real-estate-guide-to-the-upper-east-side-nyc/transportation-options-in-the-upper-east-side/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">transit options</a> can help save time while you&#8217;re looking for rooms for rent in the Upper East Side, Manhattan. The 4 Train – called the Lexington Avenue Express – is perhaps the most comprehensive option for access to Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Q train travels across Central Park and then makes a run directly through the center of Manhattan with stops along 28th, 23rd, Canal, and Prince Streets, to name a few.</p>

<p>FiDi falls under NYPD&#8217;s 1st Precinct and is one of the safest places in NYC. Having said that, we&#8217;d suggest you don&#8217;t venture out alone at night unless you have to. Also, previously FiDi did not have much nightlife, but things are changing. Today, you&#8217;ll find people out and about in the evening enjoying themselves. However, everywhere can be unsafe at times. For peace of mind, carry mace and keep emergency numbers handy. Here are some helpful numbers you can use if you ever need them.</p>
