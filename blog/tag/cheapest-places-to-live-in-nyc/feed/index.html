<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know New York is experiencing a massive influx of millennials looking for roommates; thanks to the rising cost of rent, falling incomes, and never-ending college loan payments. Are you one of the young career-oriented millennials still trying to make ends meet? Maybe you&#8217;re looking to find the best place to live in NYC, which&#8217;s cheap &amp; beautiful. Finding the cheapest place to live in NYC is probably on your mind. And for good reason &#8211; New York is one of the most expensive cities out there.</span> Along with a good apartment, you also need a good roommate. However, p<span style="font-weight: 400;">rior discussions make it a lot easier to find a great fit factoring. </span>Especially, i<span style="font-weight: 400;">n important things that matter to you such as amenities and house rules. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are quite many young people in NYC especially current students or fresh graduates just starting their careers as you. This is a generation that concentrates on lifestyle. &nbsp;Making the choice of a roommate and living in a doorman building seems to be a better option than living alone in a walk-up. New York is one of the upper-life cities that millennials would love to live in but the high cost of renting forces them to live in the outer boroughs where it is a bit cheaper.</span> However, if you get roommates you can find the best place to live in NYC! Depending on your preferences you could get your dream apartment in Brooklyn or Manhattan.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that even established older New Yorkers are today considering the option of getting a roommate to continue living in their preferred neighborhood and apartment they love. You do not have to give up on your favorite apartment simply because of changes in income, it is a lot easier to find a roommate that will supplement the rent and continue living in your favorite apartment. So you can find the cheapest</span> place to live in NYC, but it depends on the neighborhood you choose and if you&#8217;re willing to live with roommates or a shared apartment. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $580 Million Ferris wheel in St. George expected to open in 2018, with several other residential and commercial constructions make Staten Island the place to be. The Ferris wheel is an awesome upgrade of the Island with the addition of the renovations of the mall.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great residential constructions also can’t be left out such as Urby, the Island’s largest residential building with about 900 apartments. The residential construction is an eco-friendly building that attracts class of its own kind. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part of Staten Island; you have convenient transportation that connects you to other cities and neighborhoods. Despite the fact that the transport system can’t be said to be the best ever, at least it offers the convenience for commuters who love travelling outside the Island.</span></p>



<p>Moreover, there is the railway system that connects the Island to Tottenville through St. George, a ferry connecting to Manhattan,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and bridges that connect Staten with New Jersey and Brooklyn. You don’t need to worry about transport if you want to live in Staten Island while working in other parts of the city. Roommates from any of the New York City’s boroughs can conveniently reach out to each other, thanks to the convenience of the transport system.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staten Island is a small and least populated of New York City’s boroughs. This is an amazing thing to consider if you are looking for a home that gives you enough room to breathe. Staten Island brings forth a wealthy history, peaceful fascination, and attractive neighborhoods that will go well with everyone’s everyday life preferences. For a Millennial, it is a great place to live solo but among the best area to have roommates. </span></p>
