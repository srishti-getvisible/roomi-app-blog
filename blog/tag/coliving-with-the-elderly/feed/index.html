<p>Having a senior roommate can be beneficial in a variety of ways. If you hadn&#8217;t thought about it before, it’s time to reconsider. In the sitcom Two And a Half Men, we see Alan and his son Jake move in with Alan&#8217;s older brother, Charlie. Jake didn&#8217;t really get a choice in the matter (Charlie is his uncle), but he does wind up living with a senior roommate. And it doesn&#8217;t turn out so bad!</p>

<p>Life on social security or retirement payments can make it difficult for many seniors to maintain the same standard of living they enjoyed during their working years. In an increasingly costly world, living on a fixed income presents problems. Especially since the expense of maintaining living spaces and the cost of an assisted living facility have both increased.</p>



<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.seniorly.com/resource-center/senior-living-guides/understanding-the-cost-of-assisted-living" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Understanding the Cost of Assisted Living</a></p>



<p>According to data from SpareRoom, the number of individuals over 50 living with roommates is rising nearly twice as quickly as any other age group. One in every five of them is sharing a room for the first time. And it&#8217;s typically following life events such as divorce or empty nesting. Many of them are motivated by financial considerations, particularly by elderly individuals who want to remain in their homes as they age, much like Charlies’ situation. And as they say, maybe living with roommates is becoming a little less <em>Friends</em> and a little more <em>Grace and Frankie</em>.</p>



<p>If you think these are the qualities you are looking for in a person sharing a space, having senior roommates is definitely your cup of tea.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. A unique first hand experience</h2>



<p>While senior housemates are increasingly using social media, they are still lagging behind younger generations. This implies that elders have a wealth of information that you can only learn by living with them or through connecting with them in person. And, especially if you&#8217;re new to the city, who knows what amazing things you&#8217;ll learn! If only there was a book that contained the wisdom passed on by Charlie to Jake right?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Financial and social benefits</h2>



<p>With one of the highest generational divorce rates and more children moving out, many baby boomers are finding themselves living alone. Living alone is a predictor of loneliness and a risk factor for health concerns. These concerns include depression, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline, according to some studies on social isolation among older individuals.</p>



<p>Sharing a place with someone else can help them feel less lonely. And sometimes also helps you feel like you have family around. Though Charlie had no issues with his ‘social life’, he did consider Jake and Alan a bond he needed.</p>

<p>Older Americans who live alone are likewise more financially strained than those who live with others. According to Pew Research, just 33% of older individuals feel financially secure living alone. Further, SpareRoom statistics show that 63% of tenants over 50 are rent-burdened.</p>



<p>Sharing expenses while living independently can help senior citizens extend a fixed income before they decide to move to a more expensive assisted living residence. As long as the seniors can maintain their independence, the savings over continuing care retirement communities can be substantial.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Social security – especially for senior women</h2>



<p>Older women typically feel less pressed to stay in marriages for cultural or religious reasons now that divorce is less stigmatized. In fact, studies show that women are the ones who initiate the majority of divorces. Living with someone who loves her independence may be freeing and powerful for any young person. However, it&#8217;s also reassuring to know that simply being yourself can add to a senior roommate&#8217;s or older person&#8217;s happiness!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to find senior roommates</h2>



<p>Roomi is a roommate finder app that works on both Android and iOS devices. All of the postings and users on Roomi are screened to ensure that there are no red flags or fraudsters posing as potential roommates. It&#8217;s simple to use for both millennials and elders, and you can sign up for an account for free. Simply submit an ad or search for roommates once you&#8217;re up and running. Then, message those you think could be compatible. The software even goes so far as to transfer your roommate&#8217;s share of the rent on the day they move in. So, it&#8217;s well worth your time.</p>

<p>Cohousing is a method of <a href="https://www.cohousing.org/what-cohousing/cohousing/">forming a community</a>. It&#8217;s sometimes referred to as an intentional living, and it&#8217;s just that: people living in a society that they&#8217;ve purposefully created. One important thing to note here is that, cohousing communities are neither forced nor regulated by external authority. All decisions are made and values are created by the residents alone. That’s what makes this kind of community living special and a lifestyle worth considering.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is a cohousing community?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="746" height="419" data-attachment-id="13788" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/cohousing-communities/attachment/cohousing-communities/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cohousing-Communities.jpeg?fit=746%2C419&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="746,419" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Cohousing-Communities" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cohousing-Communities.jpeg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cohousing-Communities.jpeg?fit=746%2C419&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cohousing-Communities.jpeg?resize=746%2C419&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-13788" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cohousing-Communities.jpeg?w=746&amp;ssl=1 746w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cohousing-Communities.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" /><figcaption><br>via <a href="https://www.iberdrola.com/social-commitment/cohousing" class="broken_link">Iberdrola</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>We have learned that intentional living societies are described as a group of people coming together to create a neighborhood. Here, everyone has their own personal living space, in addition to a shared common house. This house typically includes a large kitchen, dining room, den, and laundry room.</p>



<p>Cohousing communities represent a set of values. Much of the time, the ideals revolve around living in a manner that fosters connection, fosters a sense of caring for one another, and is environmentally responsible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How intentional living can make us happier</strong></h2>



<p>Cohousing communities are organized around common space, so the relationships extend beyond civility. There’s a sense of unity and integrated support, which makes this concept a modern house with village virtues. People living in these communities collectively celebrate important occasions, new spouses, babies, and businesses. Moreover, offer comfort after the loss of a job or a loved one.</p>



<p>This is cohousing. It’s dependent and personal, but for all good reasons.</p>

<p>This type of a community can also act as a safety net during natural disasters such as heat waves or hurricanes. Sociologist Eric Klinenberg discovered that the close relationships built in cohousing communities set them apart — far more so than resources or preparedness — in successfully enduring such disasters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is cohousing for seniors</strong></h2>



<p>Interest in cohousing communities for seniors is rapidly growing. Many seniors have embraced this form of community living, and it&#8217;s on the rise in the US.</p>



<p>Senior living communities include 20 to 40 single-family or attached homes arranged so that everyone shares the same lawn space and walkways. eople are living longer, and the demand for houses that are constructed for people to stay independent for longer with community support are high on the wish list.</p>



<p>Not just that, but loneliness and social disconnectedness have raised the need for social bonding and health services in many places.</p>

<p>In affluent cities, sharing daily meals in a community can be both cost-effective and mentally and emotionally relaxing. Rather than relying on the nuclear family unit to fulfill all of their emotional needs, residents have access to a diverse group of individuals.</p>



<p>Part of this growth is a recent boom in senior housing community, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/business/cohousing-communities.html" class="broken_link">The New York Times</a>. The <a href="https://www.cohousing.org/senior_community_list" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Cohousing Association of the United States</a> reported 13 completed senior housing developments, with two more being built and another 13 coming together, in the US.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How much does cohousing cost</strong></h2>



<p>Cohousing homes typically cost more than other new condos or townhomes, due to generous common facilities and environmentally sustainable features.</p>

<p>Most communities offers communal living including regular maintenance and free Wi-Fi. When you compare that to the median rent of the same cities for a one-bedroom apartment, intentional living&nbsp;starts to look appealing.</p>

<p>In other places, intentional housing developments include single-family residences within a community. <a href="https://www.wildsagecohousing.org/ourcommunity_whatis.htm">Wild Sage</a>, for example, is a community neighborhood in Boulder, Colorado, where homes cost more than the Denver metro average; a three-bedroom, three-bathroom home was advertised for $725,000 at the time of publishing. Residents, on the other hand, contribute to house share management, resulting in lower homeowners association (HOA) costs.</p>



<p>Premium services are included in some cohousing communities. The WeLiving group in New York City has community studios starting at $3,091 a month, which include furnishings, housekeeping, a 24/7 front-desk crew, and a common chef&#8217;s kitchen.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to decide if intentional living community is for you</strong></h2>



<p>Depending on your lifestyle choices, you can live in a general cohousing environment or one specifically for seniors. Some individuals, for example, would choose to live in a mixed-age environment with a more family-like atmosphere and different age groups. Seniors will be willing to move to a quieter, slower-paced environment, such as a senior housing community.</p>



<p>Moreover, a study conducted by <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.cohousingresearchnetwork.org/bibliography/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cohousing Research Network</a> in 2011 found that 96 percent of people interviewed who lived in cohousing communities reported improved quality of life; 75 percent felt their physical health was better than others their age, and 96 percent had voted in the 2008 presidential election.</p>

<p>Remote and location-independent workers who enjoy moving easily and often may appreciate intentional living. Modern properties cater to several needs, offering fully furnished units and flexible rental terms so that occupants are never stuck in a lease.</p>



<p>If you want to&nbsp;combine the best parts of solo living with the benefits of a small community then cohousing is for you. It’s a beautiful way to build meaningful social connections, utilize community amenities and, hence, a lifestyle worth experiencing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you think of having roommates in a new city, you might picture a “Friends” situation: a group of 20-somethings fumbling through their careers and relationships, and still having a grand ol’ time because their roommates are awesome. While that sounds fantastic, we’re firm&nbsp;believers that an awesome roommate can be any age. Ever wondered what&#8217;s it like to live with a senior roommate? More importantly, the potential benefits coliving with the elderly provide? </p>



<p>We&#8217;ll answer all your questions! But first, let&#8217;s see how this phenomena of having an elder roommate came into being. A <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/10/08/till-death-do-us-part-no-way-gray-divorce-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">recent rise in divorces</a> for people over 50 has increased the number of seniors who have spare rooms to fill.&nbsp;That means more and more seniors are using their golden years to start another phase in their lives — much like someone in their 20s. </p>

<p>Having a senior roommate can, in so many ways, be pretty great. If you weren’t considering it before, you might want to rethink it now. We talked to Sophia, a 29-year-old Harlem resident, who shared five unexpected benefits while coliving with the elderly, who we’ll call Gabby for privacy’s sake.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. It Offers a Unique First-Hand Experience.</h2>



<p>While senior roommates are using social media more frequently, they’re still a little ways behind the younger generations. This&nbsp;means there’s a wealth of knowledge seniors have that you can only discover by coliving with the elderly. Moreover, by interacting with them&#8230; in real life. And who knows what fascinating things you’ll learn — especially when you’re new to the city.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I learned a lot about how New York used to be,” Sophia explains. “Gabby told me how New York City was in the ’70s and ’80s. As someone from Ireland, I would have never had that insight otherwise.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. There Are No Judgments When Living With A Senior Roommate</h2>



<p>Overnight guests can be a topic of contention in any roommate situation, but when Sophia first moved in with Gabby, she says she was worried that she would have to modify her behavior. But she says Gabby, then 71, didn’t mind at all if Sophia had a boyfriend or wanted to watch TV for three hours straight. Now, that’s a pretty cool senior roommate.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Originally, I thought living with someone older would mean I would have to be more subdued,” Sophia says. “But I didn’t have to change at all.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Coliving with Elderly = Mutually Beneficial Relationship</h2>



<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 28 percent of Americans aged 65 or older <a href="http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p23-212.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lived alone in 2010</a>. Loneliness can have detrimental effects on a senior’s health, and having a roommate can help. On the flip side, besides living with a caring senior roommate, it’s an opportunity for someone younger. An opportunity to gain a friend, confidant, or influential contact&nbsp;they may have never met otherwise.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We talked for hours,” Sophia says about her relationship with Gabby. “I became sort of like a daughter.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since they were both working in similar fields, Sophia says Gabby&nbsp;was also kind enough to introduce her to some of her work contacts. What started out as coliving with an elderly person, grew into something so much more enriching.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4.&nbsp;You Can Have a Lot in Common with your senior roommate</h2>

<p>Millennials are in a time of transition and are now putting off having kids until they’re older (if they decide to have families at all, that is). Only 26 percent of millennials marry before they’re 32 (as opposed to 48 percent of the baby boomers), <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. This means they may have more in common with a baby boomer, whose kids are grown and out of the house, than they originally thought.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Gabby had spent most of her savings caring for her mother and husband, who both died after debilitating illnesses…but she had a youthful spirit,” Sophia says. “She was starting her freelance journalism career, getting her name back out there. She had to start over.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sophia says she was in a similar place, both in her career and with her financial situation when she moved in with Gabby — and they became closer as a result.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. It’s Liberating for a Senior Roommate&nbsp;— Especially Women</h2>



<p>Now that there’s less stigma surrounding divorce, older women often feel less pressured to stay in marriages for societal or religious reasons. In fact, research shows that women initiate the majority of divorces.&nbsp;Living with a person who values her independence can be liberating and empowering for any young person, but it’s also comforting to know you can contribute to a senior roommate or an elderly person’s happiness by just being yourself!</p>
