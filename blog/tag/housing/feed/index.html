<p>More gender-neutral housing options are gaining popularity to cater to a more inclusive group of accommodation seekers. With these welcome changes, it has become easier to find mixed-gender housing today. If you are looking for a safe space that is inclusive of all genders, gender-inclusive housing can be great! Here is all you need to know about all-gender housing and if it is the right choice for you.<br></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-gender-neutral-housing"><strong>What is gender-neutral housing?</strong></h2>



<p>Gender-neutral housing or gender-inclusive housing is a type of accommodation that can be shared by residents of any gender. A lot of housing can be gender-specific (male/female) and can be challenging for those who do not fit into the<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary#:~:text=Gender%20binary%20(also%20known%20as,social%20system%20or%20cultural%20belief." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gender binary</a>. Therefore, neutral housing makes an inclusive option for non-binary renters. All-gender housing is great for those who may not feel comfortable or don&#8217;t prefer a same-gender-only accommodation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-gender-neutral-housing-only-for-lgbtqi-residents"><strong>Is Gender-Neutral housing only for LGBTQI+ residents?</strong></h2>



<p>No! Gender-neutral housing is for anyone who would like to live in a space that is not limited to one gender. If you are comfortable with mixed gender and inclusive space, you can consider gender-inclusive housing as an option! The whole goal is to provide a space for people who prefer a gender-neutral accommodation. This could be because you do not identify with the gender binary or a personal preference.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-i-live-with-a-romantic-partner-in-gender-neutral-housing"><strong>Can I live with a romantic partner in gender-neutral housing?</strong></h2>



<p>Well, that&#8217;s complicated. While you technically can share gender-neutral housing with a romantic partner, it is generally discouraged. On one hand, you do have a right to privacy and can live with a romantic partner. However, this can be a problematic situation in many cases and be unpleasant for you and other residents. For instance, other residents may feel uncomfortable sharing their space with a romantically involved couple. On the other hand, live-in relationships can be a big step for a couple, and one that you may not be ready for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros-and-cons-of-gender-neutral-housing"><strong>Pros and cons of gender-neutral housing</strong></h2>



<p>There are probably more benefits to all-gender housing, especially if you prefer a mixed-gender space. However, here are some of the things to keep in mind to decide whether gender-neutral housing is right for you or not.</p>

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros"><strong>Pros:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Gender identity goes beyond the gender binary, and traditional accommodation can exclude many. Gender-neutral housing recognizes the complexity of all gender identities and provides a space for it.</li>



<li><strong>Diversity:</strong> All-gender housing allows you to interact with a diverse group of people. This means you can learn about gender identities and expressions in an inclusive space. Interacting and living with a mixed group of different genders can help you gain new perspectives. Hence, you can gain deeper insights and grow as an individual.</li>



<li><strong>Safe Space:</strong> An all gender housing can be a safe space for LGBTQI+ residents to discuss their opinions and issues. A more inclusive and accepting environment can make it easier to relate or be heard and understood. Being able to interact with your peers comfortably means this type of housing can be a safe space for non-binary residents.</li>



<li><strong>No pressure!</strong> Some non-binary individuals may not identify with any particular gender or maybe still discovering their identity. Gender-neutral identity does not force you to state or disclose your gender. Hence, this option respects their privacy and gender identity. </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cons"><strong>Cons:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Though increasing in popularity, not all Colleges or places have gender-inclusive housing options. Even in places where it is an option, the capacity of mixed-gender housing facilities can be limited. Hence, the availability of gender-neutral housing can be an issue with waiting lists for some.</li>



<li><strong>Comfort-zone:</strong> Some people may not be comfortable with sharing spaces and living in close proximity with people of other genders. Having to live with people of other genders may not suit some people. In cases like this, you may be better off looking for same-gender accommodation instead.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve searched for New York apartments and narrowed your choices with organization, research, and skill. You’ve nailed all the common pitfalls of signing a lease, and you have steely-eyed confidence that nothing, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is going to get past you. You will not be ripped off, scammed, or bamboozled in any way, shape, or form. Right? Hold on there, tiger. Here are three common housing issues in NYC that you’ll want to check in any apartment you’re considering.</span></p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Everything You Need To Know About Lease Signing In New York</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ground-floor-apartments-are-cheaper-for-a-reason"><b>Ground Floor Apartments Are Cheaper For A Reason</b></h2>



<p>This one&#8217;s probably the easiest to miss, out of all the housing issues in NYC.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.pexels.com/photos/378570/pexels-photo-378570.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="New york city street with views of apartments, depicting traffic and the many housing issues in NYC"/></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That ground-floor apartment caught your eye all right. It’s the least crazy-expensive option in the building. You don’t have to fret about feeling like a Sherpa as you haul groceries up several stories on a bi-weekly basis. But why is it the cheapest, exactly? Pests, crime, and traffic. That’s why.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pests"><b>Pests</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cockroaches are appallingly durable little critters, but do you think they relish the idea of scaling the side of a skyscraper and clinging on for dear life just to snack on some tasty garbage? Of course,</span> you don’t. Because that would involve thinking about consuming trash and that’s weird. But bugs prefer to infest bottom floor apartments because there is<span style="font-weight: 400;"> more cover and less exposure to predators.</span> Even in NYC, pest control is a pressing issue for ground-floor apartments. For comprehensive solutions outside the city, check out <a href="https://www.thebiggreenk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TheBigGreenK</a> services.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-burglars"><b>Burglars</b></h3>



<p>This might be pretty crazy to think of, for housing issues in NYC, but the city just has so much to offer!</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t want to carry a big screen TV up five flights of stairs. Do you think a burglar feels any different doing it in reverse? It’s not as if they got into the burglary biz because of their sterling work ethic. Burglars often focus on bottom-floor apartments. More cover, less time. Lower exposure to the police. So, uh . . . for the exact same reasons, cockroaches prefer them, basically.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-traffic"><b>Traffic</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York never sleeps. Anyone who’s lived in a bottom-floor apartment with headlights constantly blazing through the window like photonic scythes harvesting sweet dreams can attest to that. Cars pulling in and out, people walking by and talking, laughing, or arguing, the occasional late-night crazy person doing . . . something. Something puzzling, morbidly intriguing, and undeniably loud. So if you’re looking to save some cash by sticking to the ground floor, check those windows and check them well. They should form a solid seal to diminish sound, and the shades should be made of solid material that you can pull down and block out light on demand. Those slotted Venetian blinds are like sieves for headlights. </span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-top-floor-new-york-apartments-are-so-hot"><b>Top Floor New York Apartments Are So Hot</b>!</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sultry hot, just muggy hot. Hot air rises to the top floor. In the sweltering summer of New York, the apartments higher up can be miserable if the dehumidifiers aren’t up to the task. Increased heat and humidity put the apartment at risk for mold and mildew. So make sure the HVAC system can take the heat and keep the apartment comfortable. Even if it can, expect to pay considerably more for utilities in the summer. Although you won’t have to fork over as much of your hard-earned cash once winter comes around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elevators in New York apartments and around town are so common they just fade into the background. Like pink flamingos in Florida or swimming pools in Arizona. It’s easy to forget that those things can break, and when they do, it could well mean you’re walking until they get it fixed. When was the last time your apartment building’s elevator got checked out? It should have a certificate in the elevator itself. Scope them out before you commit to signing a lease. Not just the one you plan to use because it’s closest to your room, but the backup options as well.</span></p>
