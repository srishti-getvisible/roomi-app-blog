<p>More gender-neutral housing options are gaining popularity to cater to a more inclusive group of accommodation seekers. With these welcome changes, it has become easier to find mixed-gender housing today. If you are looking for a safe space that is inclusive of all genders, gender-inclusive housing can be great! Here is all you need to know about all-gender housing and if it is the right choice for you.<br></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-gender-neutral-housing"><strong>What is gender-neutral housing?</strong></h2>



<p>Gender-neutral housing or gender-inclusive housing is a type of accommodation that can be shared by residents of any gender. A lot of housing can be gender-specific (male/female) and can be challenging for those who do not fit into the<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary#:~:text=Gender%20binary%20(also%20known%20as,social%20system%20or%20cultural%20belief." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gender binary</a>. Therefore, neutral housing makes an inclusive option for non-binary renters. All-gender housing is great for those who may not feel comfortable or don&#8217;t prefer a same-gender-only accommodation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-gender-neutral-housing-only-for-lgbtqi-residents"><strong>Is Gender-Neutral housing only for LGBTQI+ residents?</strong></h2>



<p>No! Gender-neutral housing is for anyone who would like to live in a space that is not limited to one gender. If you are comfortable with mixed gender and inclusive space, you can consider gender-inclusive housing as an option! The whole goal is to provide a space for people who prefer a gender-neutral accommodation. This could be because you do not identify with the gender binary or a personal preference.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-i-live-with-a-romantic-partner-in-gender-neutral-housing"><strong>Can I live with a romantic partner in gender-neutral housing?</strong></h2>



<p>Well, that&#8217;s complicated. While you technically can share gender-neutral housing with a romantic partner, it is generally discouraged. On one hand, you do have a right to privacy and can live with a romantic partner. However, this can be a problematic situation in many cases and be unpleasant for you and other residents. For instance, other residents may feel uncomfortable sharing their space with a romantically involved couple. On the other hand, live-in relationships can be a big step for a couple, and one that you may not be ready for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros-and-cons-of-gender-neutral-housing"><strong>Pros and cons of gender-neutral housing</strong></h2>



<p>There are probably more benefits to all-gender housing, especially if you prefer a mixed-gender space. However, here are some of the things to keep in mind to decide whether gender-neutral housing is right for you or not.</p>

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pros"><strong>Pros:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Gender identity goes beyond the gender binary, and traditional accommodation can exclude many. Gender-neutral housing recognizes the complexity of all gender identities and provides a space for it.</li>



<li><strong>Diversity:</strong> All-gender housing allows you to interact with a diverse group of people. This means you can learn about gender identities and expressions in an inclusive space. Interacting and living with a mixed group of different genders can help you gain new perspectives. Hence, you can gain deeper insights and grow as an individual.</li>



<li><strong>Safe Space:</strong> An all gender housing can be a safe space for LGBTQI+ residents to discuss their opinions and issues. A more inclusive and accepting environment can make it easier to relate or be heard and understood. Being able to interact with your peers comfortably means this type of housing can be a safe space for non-binary residents.</li>



<li><strong>No pressure!</strong> Some non-binary individuals may not identify with any particular gender or maybe still discovering their identity. Gender-neutral identity does not force you to state or disclose your gender. Hence, this option respects their privacy and gender identity. </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cons"><strong>Cons:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Though increasing in popularity, not all Colleges or places have gender-inclusive housing options. Even in places where it is an option, the capacity of mixed-gender housing facilities can be limited. Hence, the availability of gender-neutral housing can be an issue with waiting lists for some.</li>



<li><strong>Comfort-zone:</strong> Some people may not be comfortable with sharing spaces and living in close proximity with people of other genders. Having to live with people of other genders may not suit some people. In cases like this, you may be better off looking for same-gender accommodation instead.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Going off to college is both an exciting and nerve-wracking experience. It can be hard to figure out what to bring and what you will actually use while at school. There’s no need to feel overwhelmed; here&#8217;s a list of essential items to bring to college that will make your life easier and keep your dorm room organized.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. A mattress pad is on top of our essential items list!</h2>



<p>Most dorm rooms come with a twin XL mattress that isn’t always that comfortable. Be sure to bring a mattress pad so your bed is cozier and you can happily sink into it after a long day of classes! <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/7-storage-hacks-that-will-transform-your-home-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bring a throw blanket and extra pillows in order to make your dorm room feel homier!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. A trunk</h2>



<p>This is a must and perhaps one of those essential items in our list that you shouldn&#8217;t skip. Freshman dorm rooms are often limited in the amount of space that is available. Bringing a trunk to store extra clothes or other items will help you if you run out of space. To maximize your dorm room space, raise your bed frame so you are able to put your trunk and other items &#8211; such as storage bins &#8211; underneath. This will make your room look less cluttered.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Drawer dividers</h2>



<p>Dorm rooms usually have one large dresser, so clothes can easily get messy inside. Bringing drawer dividers will help to maximize your space as well as keep your clothes organized. For all of you wondering &#8211; &#8220;why are drawer dividers in an essential items list?&#8221; Well, friends if you like rummaging through a messy drawer to find your stationery and glasses like ATT &#8211; these dividers are surely not for you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. A mini-fridge (if you&#8217;re possessive about your snacks add this to your essential items) </h2>



<p>Don’t forget this! A mini-fridge is an essential item to bring to college to store drinks and snacks. You will want to have a place to store food in case you don’t feel like going to the dining hall (and to avoid the risk of your snacks being stolen). If possible, make sure to get a mini-fridge with a freezer. This way you will have ice to keep your water cold.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. A shoe rack</h2>



<p>Bringing a shoe rack is another way to help keep your dorm room clean and organized. A shoe rack helps to maximize your closet space and makes it easier to get ready in the morning. If your dorm room has a closet, tuck your shoe rack inside to hide it away and save space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6.Command strips/hooks</h2>



<p>If you want to hang up string lights, posters, a tapestry, or pictures, you should definitely bring command strips and hooks. This is an easier and cleaner way to decorate your room without having to use a hammer and nails &#8211; which you could get in trouble for! Using command strips or hooks will also make moving out less of a hassle.</p>
