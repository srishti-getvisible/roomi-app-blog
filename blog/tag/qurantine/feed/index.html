										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Unfortunately, COVID-19 is an unwelcome guest in the world that is either keeping us trapped at home. Or we&#8217;re feeling on edge with our masks on every time we step out, imagining COVID symptoms in everyone we encounter.</p>



<p>And if you live with roommates, an inevitable panic can set in, even in our safe spaces at home. You find yourself worrying about your roommate contracting the coronavirus if they&#8217;re an essential worker, or if they&#8217;re stepping out more often than required. Each time they come back home, you may have had some unwelcome thoughts entering your head.</p>



<p>While you don&#8217;t need to be worried all the time, there are some basic guidelines you should be aware of to cope with shared housing in times of coronavirus. While the CDC says <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">most people have mild COVID-19 illness and can recover at home without medical care</a>, it is better to get tested to be sure and stay safe.</p>



<p>If you can see signs that your roommate has COVID symptoms, it&#8217;s always best that they get tested. In the meantime, this guide will help you navigate shared living.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Practise the COVID-19 social distancing within your home</h2>



<p>In a situation like this, it is best to physically isolate your sick roommate to a separate room, so that they are comfortable moving around in that space without worrying about infecting the other members of the house. And you will be comfortable, too. This includes having a separate bathroom, if that&#8217;s possible.</p>



<p>But if you live in a small apartment where the number of rooms is limited, make sure your roomi has a physically isolated space in the home you share. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-work-from-home-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keep your activities separate</a> and try to keep a distance between you and your sick roommate at all times. If you share a bathroom, advise your roomi to use a toiletry bag instead of keeping their things on the counter. Also, keep all dishes, towels, electronics, and gadgets separate. In this case, NOT sharing is caring.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Stay in touch (emotionally)</h2>



<p>If your roommate has COVID symptoms, they are more scared than you are! While you practice social distancing and avoid any physical contact with your sick roommate, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/mindful-habits-for-your-mental-health-during-covid-19/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">do remember to check in on them emotionally</a>. Take advantage of your thin walls, and talk through them, or sit by their door and make conversation. You could drop in notes for your sick friend to let them know you care about their well-being. Or just call or text them on their phone. Admit it: you guys always used to text from the other room just because getting out of bed was too much of an effort. So put that practice to good use now.</p>



<p>If you need to be around your sick roommate physically, both of you should wear masks and you should thoroughly wash your hands after each visit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Help your sick roommate out with food &amp; laundry</h2>



<p>To avoid the risk of exposure, it is best to prepare food for your roommate and deliver it to their room. Once they&#8217;ve eaten, carry all dirty dishes and whatever else they might have touched with gloves on. Sanitize everything they&#8217;ve touched in hot water before you wash them. You can do your roomi&#8217;s laundry with gloves on as well. Once you&#8217;ve rinsed them, you can wash their load with yours without any risk of exposure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Quarantine yourself too</h2>



<p>If you live in a household where coronavirus is present, you should avoid going out too. Even if one roommate has COVID symptoms, opt for no contact deliveries for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-covid-essentials-to-keep-at-home-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID essentials</a> or ask a neighbor or friend to help. Stay in with your roommate, even if you don&#8217;t feel sick. After they&#8217;ve recovered, all members of your household should self-quarantine for another two weeks, at least.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Keep up with high standards of hygiene</h2>



<p>Make sure you frequently sanitize all countertops and surfaces your roommate might be coming in contact with. Except for entering their confined spaces, disinfect the other areas regularly. It would be best if you also practiced washing hands more often to stay safe.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Stay alert, but do not panic!</h2>



<p>A situation like this could be panic-inducing, but don&#8217;t give in to the panic. What has happened has happened. The best thing you could do is be there for your friend while keeping your mental peace. It may feel like you have a lot on your plate if your roommate falls sick with the coronavirus, but remember that you&#8217;re strictly adhering to guidelines for your own health too.</p>



<p>These are trying times, but trust that you&#8217;ll come out of this victoriously!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 unleashed a load of unexpected change in all our lives. The pandemic altered and disturbed the natural course of our professional and academic growth, slowing down our skills development and practices. This has rendered many of us feeling doubtful about our future. Most of us are spending time moping and hanging on our phones all day, trying to figure out life until we can begin living normally again.</p>



<p>Take it from us: it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way! Many students and graduates are adding to their professional developmental skills using all their free quarantine time. If you&#8217;re feeling up to it, why not see what you can achieve? (We can see your mom nodding approvingly at the back). So here&#8217;s a list of professional skills that can boost your job opportunities and help you use your precious quarantine time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-fix-your-resume">1. Fix your resume!</h2>



<p>When was the last time you updated or fixed your resume? This task is probably the most procrastinated of &#8217;em all. The quarantine may be a great time to dust it off; a professional resume needs a different kind of treatment compared to a high school resume. <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/cv-format-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Your professional resume must entail</a> skills, projects, and experiences aligned with your goal. If your goal is to become a copywriter, make sure to include any experience and skills that support your goal. Add class projects, internships, research, new skills, and student involvement in your resume. There are some great tools like Canva, visme that offer awesome templates for free and will sweep your interviewer off their feet because they not only help you in getting your first interview but with the help of such interactive content creation tools you can make your interview assignment look even more appealing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-take-up-college-courses-and-learn-new-skills">2. Take up college courses and learn new skills</h2>



<p>Studying at Yale or Stanford is easier than ever with&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coursera</a>. This site lets you choose from nearly 3,900 online courses from more than 190 prominent universities and businesses from around the globe. You can get college credits or a certification depending on the course model you choose. The learning curve is endless here, and most courses that teach you are free on this site. Other options for free and affordable skills development courses include <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edX</a> and <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.futurelearn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">FutureLearn</a>. Happy learning, folks <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-build-your-online-presence">3. Build your online presence</h2>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re a writer, digital marketer, data analyst, or web designer – your online presence can help you get more clients and work. Here are some practices that will help you do so during quarantine:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linkedin-nbsp">LinkedIn&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Get your LinkedIn profile up to date using the content from your resume.&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/how-to-make-your-profile-stand-out-on-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revamp your LinkedIn profile to stand out</a>; choose a great photo and invest in LinkedIn Learnings. All of these efforts are worth it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-media-platforms">Social media platforms</h3>



<p>Businesses around the world are leveraging top platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to build and maintain their presence. You, too, can <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/10-steps-to-building-your-personal-brand-on-social-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harness social media’s strength</a> by presenting your work and connecting yourself with like-minded individuals/businesses. Using tools like an <a href="https://murf.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI voice generator</a>, you can create engaging audio content to complement your posts on these platforms. These low-cost platforms can enable your work to be seen worldwide and noticed within your personal network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-website-nbsp">Website&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Another great tool to display your portfolio is via your own site. A neat and user-friendly website can speak volumes and scream, &#8220;I am so professional, I have a website, you guys!&#8221; Some popular user-friendly sites include&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wix.com/html5en/in-hiker-create?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2-G7jLOO6wIVVwQrCh0UKQfnEAAYASAAEgIQVPD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wix</a>,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://webflow.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=general-paid-branded&amp;utm_term=keyword-targeting&amp;utm_content=branded-ads&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5LLMw7OO6wIVSgwrCh2O_gMmEAAYASAAEgLWTPD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Webflow</a>, and&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wordpress.com/create/?v=india_go_to_market&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=google_wpcom_search_brand_desktop_in_en&amp;utm_medium=paid_search&amp;keyword=wordpress&amp;creative=329641414965&amp;campaignid=683204332&amp;adgroupid=31861711621&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;targetid=kwd-313411415&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9JzB2bOO6wIVzBErCh3EwgxtEAAYASAAEgI2UfD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-new-professional-skills-learn-a-new-language">4. New professional skills: Learn a new language</h2>



<p>Being fluent in a second language adds extra oomph to your resume. This valuable skill can also help you get job placements in your dream state/city. Learning a new language needs patience and time, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-places-to-learn-a-new-language-online-for-fre.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">some great mobile apps</a>&nbsp;are making this process easy and fun, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duolingo&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.babbel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Babble</a>.</p>

<p>Quarantine or no quarantine – never stop learning new skills! There&#8217;s just so much you can pick up online – from millions of courses, tutorials, and classes, you have material for skills development that can last you a lifetime. From cool video editing software to intense Ted Talks on building businesses, the world is your playground or workground (depending on how you perceive work).</p>
