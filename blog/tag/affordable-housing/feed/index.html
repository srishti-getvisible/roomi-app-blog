<p>You&#8217;ve finally decided that you&#8217;re moving to NYC and now you can&#8217;t help but dread the unnerving yet exciting process of apartment hunting. While apartment hunting is always stressful, coronavirus has made it even worse. Well, don&#8217;t you worry. Because our guide to renting affordable housing in New York is here to save you. This is a really handy guide for all of you who&#8217;re wondering: <em>&#8220;ugh, where should I start?&#8221;</em>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got your renting needs covered; from paperwork &amp; documents, and from research to different online portals that&#8217;ll help you find studio apartments &amp; affordable housing in NYC!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can I find affordable housing in New York City?</h2>



<p>Start apartment hunting&nbsp;<em>a month to six weeks</em>&nbsp;before moving to NYC. Research is vital in finding cheap and affordable housing in New York. If you&#8217;re moving from another city, spend some time to look at rental postings online to get an estimate of rent, space and neighborhoods. Some great platforms to find apartments and do research are&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_rent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Zillow rentals</a>,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.listingsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Listing Projects</a>, and&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://streeteasy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Streeteasy</a>. You&#8217;ll have to do much of your apartment hunting online, because coronavirus has pretty much shut everything down. </p>



<p>You could also browse a variety of rental postings on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/547466899383959" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">private and public groups on Facebook</a>. Additionally, explore&nbsp;Craigslist&nbsp;to find sublets or rental postings, and if you&#8217;re lucky, you might even come across Rent Stabilized Apartments too! Rent Stabilized places are hard to come by, but they are great and can save you from crazy price hikes and unfair landlord behavior.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Rent stabilization is a form of rent regulation in New York that&#8217;s overseen by the New York state Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR). It is different, but related to, rent control. For an apartment to be rent-controlled, the same tenant, or a &#8220;lawful successor&#8221; of that tenant (i.e., a family member or spouse), needs to have been living in the apartment continuously since 1971. No new rent-controlled apartments are created. &#8221; </em></p><cite><em>&#8211; Curbed, New York</em></cite></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s an ideal time to find affordable housing in New York?</h2>



<p>Fall and winter are the best seasons to move if you want to get affordable housing in New York! So, if you have the luxury to choose (<em>consider it!</em>), it could save you tons of money. Student internships and graduate programs start in summer, which attracts students to find accommodation in the city. This makes the New York City rental prices even more competitive. Typically, fewer people will be moving to NYC during the winters, making landlords more willing to cut you a great deal. We live in unprecedented times due to the coronavirus pandemic, which is unfortunate in all aspects except for one silver lining &#8211;&nbsp;<em>the buyer&#8217;s market</em>.</p>



<p>The coronavirus pandemic forced many residents to leave the city because of the ambiguity and large scale impact. This has led to many landlords willing to rent their apartments at a lower cost (this means we are in the buyer&#8217;s market and can essentially negotiate the price.) The coronavirus pandemic has also opened sublet options because of many students moving back home. So, a good relationship with your subletter could land you an excellent deal. Use this opportunity to stay in the city while finding your dream apartment.</p>



<p><em>Conclusion: Offseason and unpopular times mean cheaper rent.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Paperwork &amp; finances before moving to New York</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re moving to NYC, money flies. It&#8217;s advisable to plan all your expenditures &amp; paperwork well in advance before you move to the city.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi advice:</strong> <em>It&#8217;s recommend to keep your rent money separate from the rest of your expenditures.</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So how much should you keep aside?</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re moving to NYC, prepare to save at least $3,000 before renting your accommodation. That might seem a little expensive, but that&#8217;s just how much affordable housing in New York is going to cost. Depending on your needs and outgoings, this amount may vary. Still, New Yorkers (or renters in any high-demand markets) must save 3-4 months of rent before moving.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rental Structure </strong></td><td><strong>Price</strong></td><td><strong>What is it?</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Application fee</td><td>$20</td><td>A fee that all potential tenants pay to submit their applications for the landlord to review.</td></tr><tr><td>Security deposit</td><td>$2000</td><td>A good faith deposit along with the application fee. If your application is denied the deposit is refunded.</td></tr><tr><td>First month&#8217;s rent</td><td>$2000</td><td>If your application is approved, the landlord keeps the deposit and requests the first month&#8217;s rent.</td></tr><tr><td>Broker&#8217;s fee</td><td>$3600</td><td>Most broker fees include one month&#8217;s rent and 15% of the annual rent. * insert palpitations *</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Note: <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/nyregion/nyc-landlord-rental-broker-fees.html#:~:text=A%20judge%20has%20temporarily%20halted,barring%20brokers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">The New York Department of State released guidance specifying that landlords will now have to pay broker fees in New York City, not the tenants.</a> However, the landlords are the little lords of NYC, so this rule also means that the broker charge may be added to the main rent of the house by the landlord. We know finding affordable housing in New York might seem impossible right now, but hang in there! Because your dream NYC apartment is just around the corner!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s the income requirement?</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Most landlords look for 40-50 times the rent. If you are looking for a $3000/month apartment, then you must make $120,000 to qualify. If not, you must have a US guarantor that makes 80 times the rent. If you are sharing with roommates, then most landlords will combine the total.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>Sabina Sangha, Licensed Real Estate Salesperson at Compass</em></cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Apartments in New York are <strong>rented out</strong> in the blink of an eye, so as a renter you have to be on your toes to grab your desired apartment before it&#8217;s gone. Affordable housing in New York is hard to come by, so be prepared to fight for it (Not literally, of course)!</p>



<p><strong>Roomi Advice:</strong> <em>Carry your paperwork &amp; documents when visiting open houses and reach them at least 15 mins before. Because if you like a house, you need to be prompt in  submitting your paperwork and your security deposit.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Paperwork &amp; Documents </strong></td><td><strong>Personal Documents </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Proof of income: Letter of employment, offer letters</td><td>Scanned Photo ID</td></tr><tr><td>CPA letter for verification of self employment (for self employed)</td><td>Mock Application </td></tr><tr><td>Last 2 years of tax return</td><td>Letter of Recommendation : Landlord(preferably) or roommates </td></tr><tr><td>Last 2 paychecks/pay stubs</td><td>Blank checks (in case you like the department and want to give the deposit upfront </td></tr><tr><td>Last 2 months of bank statements</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Credit Score</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to hear some war stories that would send shivers down the spine of a hardened US Marine, talk to someone who’s been through the harrowing experience of finding an affordable room in NYC. There are more masterful bait-and-switch artists then there are dudes working hot dog stands. Some roommates will have you knocking on the door to your local insane asylum for just one night of “peace and quiet.” And let’s not even start on the astronomical cost of living.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you aren’t going to let that stop you. Why? Because NYC is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">awesome</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is, without exaggeration, one of the most storied, entertaining, opportunity-rich places in the entire freaking world. Whether you’re trying to move here or you are already proud to be a New Yorker, this isn’t just a place to live. It’s a dream in real time, an unshakable ambition.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We both know you aren’t going to give up just because it’s tough and expensive. If you were that kind of person, you’d never have survived the plane ride over or made it a goal in the first place. So lets examine the different ways to find an affordable room in NYC and learn from the mistakes of others. Because New Yorkers gotta stick together.</span></p>



<p><b>Let Someone Else Find A Room In NYC For You</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brokers are actually kind of unique to NYC. In the rest of the US, people usually just handle apartment searches themselves. Lots of people turn to brokers in the hope that they will provide a competitive rate. In fact, some apartment complexes in NYC won’t even talk to you unless you go through a broker. Like you’re an author trying to submit a book to a major publisher who refuses you for lacking an agent. Only in New York, right?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for this bizarre phenomenon is pretty simple. Supply and demand. Despite the high cost of living, apartments of any quality from dubious to divine go fast. Let’s keep in mind, NYC rocks the house down. Like, every day and in every way. (Okay, except apartment searching. Obviously.) So lots of landowners let brokers do the heavy lifting when it comes to filling vacancies. The drawback for you is that brokers charge a fee, often 15% or even more. To further complicate things, there is no shortage of scammers posing as reliable brokers. So there’s no guarantee that working with a broker will be cheaper or safer. On to the next approach.</span></p>



<p><b>Find A Room In NYC On Your Own</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk, drive, or take the train. Finding a room on your own sounds like a bright alternative compared to dealing with shady brokers or getting a door slammed shut in your face by an uppity landlord. But the biggest drawback is that New York. Is. Massive. Like, mind-bogglingly gargantuan. There is a reason that, in the movies, any monster wrecking New York is the size of a skyscraper. Because it would take a smaller monster way too long and we’ve all got places to be. If you try to tackle it on your own, you’ll never see 99% of what’s out there, even if your one of those crazy marathon peoples who thinks running 26.2 miles in New York’s 90% humidity in the dead of summer is somehow a good time. It’s impossible to get a decent sampling of what’s out there on your own. Which brings us to the final approach. And if you were worried there wasn’t a good way to find an affordable room in NYC, fret not. We’ve saved the best for last.</span></p>
