<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting to know Springfield, IL</strong></h2>



<p>Springfield is the capital of the U.S. state of Illinois and the county seat and largest city of Sangamon County. Present-day Springfield was settled by European Americans in the late 1810s, around the time Illinois became a state.</p>



<p>The most famous historic resident of Springfield is Abraham Lincoln. He lived here from 1837 until 1861 when he went to the White House as President. So, some of the most popular tourist attractions you will find here are museums dedicated to the legacy of Abraham Lincoln.</p>



<p>Specifically, the city lies in a valley and plain near the Sangamon River. The weather in Springfield is also fairly typical for middle latitude locations. There are four distinct seasons, including hot summers and cold winters.</p>

<p>The main Springfield area is also based on a handy grid street system, with numbered streets starting with the longitudinal First Street. This part of the city leads to the Illinois State Capitol. Then further into 32nd Street in the far eastern part of the city. Before, the city had four distinct boundary streets. These included: North, South, East, and West Grand Avenues. Since the expansion, West Grand Avenue became MacArthur Boulevard. And then East Grand became 19th Street on the north side, and 18th Street on the south side.</p>



<p>Springfield has at least twenty separately designated neighborhoods, though not all are incorporated with associations. Additionally, Springfield encompasses four different suburban villages that have their own municipal governments. They include Jerome, Leland Grove, Southern View, and Grandview. It&#8217;s known as a very ethnically diverse city, with notable ancestries of people here including German, Irish, English, Italian and French.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to move here and are looking for rooms to rent in Springfield, here are the top neighborhoods in the city!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Top neighborhoods in Springfield, IL</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Downtown</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re a young adult moving to Springfield for work or school, you may want to consider finding a room for rent in Downtown, Springfield. Downtown&#8217;s close to restaurants and other fun activities. With a walk score of 77, it’s the most walkable neighborhood in the city. While it does have a high walk score and a bike score of 44, most downtown residents claim it’s still necessary to have a car. Interstate 55 runs north-south intersecting east-west highway 97 right in the middle of downtown.</p>



<p>The Old State Capitol building, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library, and Museum, and HSHS St. John’s Hospital are downtown. There isn’t a lot of housing available downtown, and except for Springfield High School, schools rate below average.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enos Park</strong></h3>



<p>Enos Park is directly north of downtown and encompasses 36 square blocks of homes and businesses. It was known as the “Jewel of Springfield,” and was home to both wealthy and working-class alike. Even today, it’s the most socio-economically and ethnically diverse neighborhood in Springfield. So, to find a room to rent in this part of town is fairly easy. You’ll find many styles of early 19th century homes, some of which owners have beautifully restored. If you prefer to purchase a fixer-upper, some are still waiting for some TLC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Old Aristocracy Hill</strong></h3>



<p>Springfield&#8217;s neighborhood is known for its active neighborhood association dedicated to maintaining a safe, beautiful and friendly place to live and work. They also strive to preserve the historic nature of the area where you’ll find a mix of owner-occupied homes and multi-family dwellings. Old Aristocracy Hill lies just south of downtown, between Capitol Ave to South Grand and S Second to S Ninth. It has a healthy walk score of 62 and a bike score of 60.</p>



<p>The neighborhood is especially convenient if you work in downtown government administration or one of the large hospitals!</p>

<p>There is also a lot of housing in Springfield built from 1970 to 1999 so parts of town may have that &#8220;Brady Bunch&#8221; look of homes popular in the &#8217;70s and early &#8217;80s, although some of these houses were built up through the early &#8217;90s as well.
