<p>It’s okay to feel confused on where to start when it comes to shared apartment hunting, especially in NYC. You have all these chaotic stream of questions like “<a href="https://www.instructables.com/Tips-for-Moving-in-New-York-City/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">where to begin</a>? how to find someone to share an apartment? how to be within budget?” and so on. Here, at Roomi, we hear you! So, here’s your go-to guide that answers all questions about a shared apartment, finding your perfect roommate and room share in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is an apartment share?</strong></h2>



<p>A shared apartment is defined as two or more people who live in one permanent rental housing unit. They all are responsible for sharing costs associated with maintaining housing such as rent and utilities. In simple terms, share houses are basically rental places with shared spaces separate from your private room.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why share an apartment?</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s face it, apartments and rooms are expensive in NYC! So, for most people, renting on your own is going to be exorbitant unless you&#8217;re earning megabucks. For many, living with roommates is the best alternative to living somewhere out in the suburbs. That being said, there are plenty of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/rooms" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">opportunities to find affordable</a> shared apartments, and room share possibilities in NYC. After all, living&nbsp;in&nbsp;the city is all about living&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;the city, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Besides, it’s a great way for gathering together to share and exchange in a new way of living, and make amazing friends along the way. Shared apartments have lower initial and monthly costs paralleled to regular rental apartments. This makes life more comfortable as one can live quite reasonably in them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is a shared apartment different from room share?</strong></h3>



<p>A room share is when two friends rent a room from an owner directly. This also is the situation where there are 4 roommates living in a <a href="https://theconversation.com/room-sharing-is-the-new-flat-sharing-84359" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">2-bedroom apartment</a>. This can ruin your privacy unless you’re accustomed to the habits of your roommate.</p>

<p>In the case of shared apartment, often a business manager leases the house by finding residents to oversee and supervise the property. The management, cleaning, and responding to residents&#8217; problems are all the responsibility of the management company so you can live comfortably.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">R<strong>oom/apartment share go easy on the wallet</strong></h3>



<p>One of the room share benefits is that, you&#8217;ll split the cost of the apartment with others. This will bring down the amount you spend on rent, leaving you with more dollars in your pocket to spend on actually living. Not only will your monthly outgoings be lower, but you&#8217;ll also have to worry less about a full security deposit. This would make it easier to secure a room than a shared apartment for rent. Utilities are generally inexpensive when you split the cost with roommates too.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>With shared apartment comes shared living</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re new to a city, living with roommates gives you an instant connection, plugging you into the life of the city. Even in situations when you don&#8217;t have an established network of friends to socialize, shared apartment culture is riveting. In cases where you&#8217;ve already got a social life, you rarely feel like coming home to a silent apartment.</p>

<p>Living in the midst of beautiful art is bound to put you in a better frame of mind and make your day a lot better. To decorate your shared apartment, one needs a lot of brainstorming. After the year we’ve had, we could all use some pleasant changes, right? Now we know what you’re thinking &#8211; do you have any idea what that costs? Bear with us- we can give you 4 home decor ideas for a shared apartment even on a budget.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>The ability to make somebody feel something: that&#8217;s art. However you look at it, whether you&#8217;re an author, a painter, a singer, a rapper, a spoken-word artist &#8211; art.</p><cite>Wale</cite></blockquote>



<p>Let’s start with the whole notion of art itself. It’s not just Picassos and Jackson Pollocks. As Wale so expertly explains above, art makes you feel something. So it’s not restricted to a framed piece or even something that’s bought. Look within to find something that stirs your soul. The golden light of sunset? Sunflowers that remind you of home? A photograph of your dear ones? A cherished letter? Then you find something that channels that feeling. Here are a few ideas to get you going:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Neon signage</h2>

<p>One of the best things about signage is that it can say anything you want it to. It can be an inside joke that makes you smile every time you see it. Or it can remind you of your favorite bar back home or be reaffirming. It also doesn’t have to break the bank as it can be a weekend DIY project!</p>



<p>We love LED signage because it channels an edgy, New York City vibe home decor. Choose from chalkboard signage, 3-D paper lettering, or marquee signage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. An artful gallery of personal moments</h2>

<p>As we look back on our lives, memories stand out. Family gatherings in your backyard or days out with your friends. What could be more soulful than a gallery of the significant moments in your life?</p>



<p>You can choose uniform frames to hold the pawprints of that furry friend who stole your heart, a pressed flower from your garden at home, or movie stubs from the day out with your friends. It could be anything as long as it really makes you feel something. Frame it so you can remind yourself of the good times.</p>

<p>This idea is great for the public spots within shared apartments, especially for making them picture-perfect. Create ‘corners’ of art with a variety of textures, colors, and home decor pieces.</p>



<p>Roommates can merge elements that are personally meaningful to them. Think pops of color, artistically positioned mirrors, or flowers. This is a collaborative process to help you learn more about your roommates and bring you closer together.</p>

<p>Isn’t art trying to recreate nature after all? Why have a painting of a sunflower when you can have the sunflower itself blooming in your living room?</p>



<p>Apartment decor and plants are a duo that will work in all spaces: small apartments, large apartments, shared apartments, and even in your own room! Imagine being able to feast your eyes on a truly green space whenever you want. Using plants in home decor is a trend that we’re happy to get behind!</p>



<p>Whether you purchase art worth thousands of dollars or frame a drawing made by your little niece- you’re looking for pieces that move you. We recommend decorating shared apartments with pieces that aim to uplift those who live in them.</p>



<p>Just like art does.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve searched for New York apartments and narrowed your choices with organization, research, and skill. You’ve nailed all the common pitfalls of signing a lease, and you have steely-eyed confidence that nothing, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is going to get past you. You will not be ripped off, scammed, or bamboozled in any way, shape, or form. Right? Hold on there, tiger. Here are three common housing issues in NYC that you’ll want to check in any apartment you’re considering.</span></p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Everything You Need To Know About Lease Signing In New York</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ground-floor-apartments-are-cheaper-for-a-reason"><b>Ground Floor Apartments Are Cheaper For A Reason</b></h2>



<p>This one&#8217;s probably the easiest to miss, out of all the housing issues in NYC.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.pexels.com/photos/378570/pexels-photo-378570.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="New york city street with views of apartments, depicting traffic and the many housing issues in NYC"/></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That ground-floor apartment caught your eye all right. It’s the least crazy-expensive option in the building. You don’t have to fret about feeling like a Sherpa as you haul groceries up several stories on a bi-weekly basis. But why is it the cheapest, exactly? Pests, crime, and traffic. That’s why.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pests"><b>Pests</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cockroaches are appallingly durable little critters, but do you think they relish the idea of scaling the side of a skyscraper and clinging on for dear life just to snack on some tasty garbage? Of course,</span> you don’t. Because that would involve thinking about consuming trash and that’s weird. But bugs prefer to infest bottom floor apartments because there is<span style="font-weight: 400;"> more cover and less exposure to predators.</span> Even in NYC, pest control is a pressing issue for ground-floor apartments.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-burglars"><b>Burglars</b></h3>



<p>This might be pretty crazy to think of, for housing issues in NYC, but the city just has so much to offer!</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t want to carry a big screen TV up five flights of stairs. Do you think a burglar feels any different doing it in reverse? It’s not as if they got into the burglary biz because of their sterling work ethic. Burglars often focus on bottom-floor apartments. More cover, less time. Lower exposure to the police. So, uh . . . for the exact same reasons, cockroaches prefer them, basically.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-traffic"><b>Traffic</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York never sleeps. Anyone who’s lived in a bottom-floor apartment with headlights constantly blazing through the window like photonic scythes harvesting sweet dreams can attest to that. Cars pulling in and out, people walking by and talking, laughing, or arguing, the occasional late-night crazy person doing . . . something. Something puzzling, morbidly intriguing, and undeniably loud. So if you’re looking to save some cash by sticking to the ground floor, check those windows and check them well. They should form a solid seal to diminish sound, and the shades should be made of solid material that you can pull down and block out light on demand. Those slotted Venetian blinds are like sieves for headlights. </span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-top-floor-new-york-apartments-are-so-hot"><b>Top Floor New York Apartments Are So Hot</b>!</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sultry hot, just muggy hot. Hot air rises to the top floor. In the sweltering summer of New York, the apartments higher up can be miserable if the dehumidifiers aren’t up to the task. Increased heat and humidity put the apartment at risk for mold and mildew. So make sure the HVAC system can take the heat and keep the apartment comfortable. Even if it can, expect to pay considerably more for utilities in the summer. Although you won’t have to fork over as much of your hard-earned cash once winter comes around.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-going-down-elevator-certification"><b>Going Down? Elevator Certification</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elevators in New York apartments and around town are so common they just fade into the background. Like pink flamingos in Florida or swimming pools in Arizona. It’s easy to forget that those things can break, and when they do, it could well mean you’re walking until they get it fixed. When was the last time your apartment building’s elevator got checked out? It should have a certificate in the elevator itself. Scope them out before you commit to signing a lease. Not just the one you plan to use because it’s closest to your room, but the backup options as well.</span></p>
