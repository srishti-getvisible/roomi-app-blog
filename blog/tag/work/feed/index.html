<p>Let&#8217;s face it, 2020 has been a year of significant change.</p>



<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals all over the world have had to make the decision to work from home.</p>



<p>While you might enjoy the routine of working from an office, 2020 has shown us that staying home to work isn’t as bad as we thought it would be!</p>



<p>In fact, there are plenty of benefits. When you work from home, there’s no need to worry about long commutes or showing up late to meetings&#8230; plus, you can wear sweatpants all day!</p>



<p>So, how do you navigate working from home while <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-living with a roommate?</a></p>



<p>From Zoom meetings to business calls, it can be hard to stay focused and keep work private while living with another person.</p>



<p>Here are a few tips to help you work from home effectively while living with roommates!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-create-a-schedule">Create a schedule</h2>



<p>Creating structure is an absolutely crucial part of working from home efficiently when living with a roomi or roommates. Why? Because can be super easy to get distracted when sharing a space with another person! If your roommate is on a different schedule than you and spends their days watching Netflix on full volume while you’re trying to make a business call, things can get tricky.</p>



<p>In order to avoid schedule clashes with your roomi, try and map out your days during the week in terms of what time your meetings fall, or when you really need some quiet time to knuckle down. Let your roommate know when it’s okay to make noise in the kitchen and when you really need the apartment to be quiet. Creating a schedule for yourself will help you and your roommate structure your time more efficiently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-be-flexible-life-happens">Be flexible, life happens!</h2>



<p>Sometimes things don’t work out the way we want them to, and that’s okay!</p>



<p>When working from home, there are a number of distractions that can arise compared to when working from an office. We can&#8217;t always control outside factors, so we need to be able to be flexible with our schedule and structure! Maybe there’s construction going on in your apartment, or your roommate is working out in the living room? if you can&#8217;t block out the noise and focus. why not head to your local coffee shop to complete your work instead of working from your apartment that day? Try and remember that life happens and issues can come up unexpectedly, and sometimes you just have to run with it!</p>



<p>Take a deep breath and try and remain relaxed and flexible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-create-a-daily-routine">Create a daily routine</h2>



<p>Making a routine for yourself will help you feel more normal amongst these challenging times. Just because you’re working from home, it doesn’t mean that your professionalism has to go out of the window (the sweat pants can stay of course!). Make sure that you go to bed at the same time as you would normally, wake up early, and eat breakfast before you start your day. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great option to incorporate daily planner templates into your daily routine to plan your day effectively and maintain a structured schedule. Be sure to wear a professional work shirt in order to make you feel the part, and if you can, encourage your roomi to get into a work routine with you &#8211; it’ll make creating structure much easier!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-communicate-with-your-roommate">Communicate with your roommate</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/why-is-my-roommate-not-talking-to-me-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">As with any relationship, communication is key!</a> Working from home is a huge life change for everyone, and it may take some time for you and your roommate to get used to your new routine. Be sure to communicate with your roomi about what you need from them in order to work efficiently and effectively. Your job depends on it! Set aside blocks of time when you need the apartment to be quiet and decide which area in your apartment will act as your office space, even if it is a corner in your bedroom. It’s important to separate your relaxing area from your work area.</p>



<p>Let your roommate know if something isn’t working for you, and make sure that they do the same with you! After all, you’re in this together!</p>

<p>Getting better sleep will help you be more productive in the morning. There are many reasons as to why we might have trouble hitting the hay. With the continued weight of the pandemic, stress and anxiety are at an all time high, and it can be difficult to wind down after a stressful day at work. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-tips-for-anxiety-and-stress-management-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take a deep breath and stop stressing!</a>  </p>



<p>Here are 4 tips to help you sleep better throughout the night and improve sleep quality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Put down the electronics to sleep better!</h2>



<p>It can be tempting to stay up and watch late night episodes of our favorite Netflix shows, or scroll through Insta and dream of one day visiting the spots in all the #wanderlust posts. However, exposure to electronics late at night can harm our ability to fall asleep, and disturb us throughout the night. Nighttime light exposure decreases our body’s melatonin levels &#8211; a hormone produced by the brain to help us fall asleep.</p>

<p>To improve sleep quality keep your shut-eye in tact! For minimizing your light exposure at night, be sure to turn off electronics at least an hour before you plan to go to bed. Turn then off completely &#8211; so you aren’t tempted to open your computer back up and eye up your work emails. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Skip the coffee to improve sleep quality</h2>



<p>A cup of coffee in the morning is a necessity for most of us in order to get through a long workday. However, drinking coffee later on in the day can harm our ability to fall asleep at night. Caffeine stimulates our nervous systems and as a result interferes with our body’s ability to fall asleep. Be sure to stop consuming caffeine by 3:00 pm or 4:00 pm so you sleep better at night. Craving a warm drink later in the day? Switch out coffee for a decaffeinated tea instead!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Avoid long naps during the day to sleep better at night</h2>



<p>Taking a nap during the day can be beneficial if we had a terrible night’s sleep or if we’re feeling under the weather. However, consistent or long naps during the day can throw off our body’s internal clock when it’s time for bed. Instead of taking a long nap, take a short 20-minute power nap. Or, (if it’s before 3:00 pm), have another cup of coffee to wake yourself up and power through the day. The effects of napping are different for each individual. However, if you’re a big napper and realize that your sleep is disrupted at night, try going to bed earlier instead of napping during the day!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Treat yourself!</h2>



<p>It can often be difficult to wind down after a long day at work or if we’re feeling stressed or anxious. It’s crucial to have downtime at the end of the day so our bodies are able to relax and so we can sleep better. </p>

<p>We all have those days <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/motivating-yourself-to-work-from-home-in-2021-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">when our brain doesn&#8217;t want to cooperate with us</a>. And it almost feels like a crashed/unreadable file that won&#8217;t open no matter how many times you tap or click on it. Although the frustration is real, instead of banging your head against the wall (or better yet your keyboard) you could read funny comics to get your brain&#8217;s essential juices flowing again! </p>



<p>Here is Roomi&#8217;s recommendation for the best funny comics in 2020.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. The Oatmeal</h2>



<p>The Oatmeal is nothing like the boring &#8216;healthy meal&#8217; name it takes after. Instead, the cartoonist Matthew Boyd Inman brings a fresh, quirky &amp; satirical take on many old and new everyday things. And our personal favorite is how he tries to describe the life of pets using his ROFL quality humor in his funny comics!</p>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read the comics of Oatmeal here</a>, or you could&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">follow them on Instagram</a>&nbsp;for timely cackles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Extra Fabulous Comics</h2>



<p>If you love dark, inappropriate humor, these funny comics will be your go-to haunt.</p>



<p>Often described as NSFW (Not Safe For Work) &#8211; though some pieces are okay for the office! However, these funny comics entail dark, off-color puns, twisted ends, realistically unrealistic closure. Also, you have to read the comic to really know what we are saying. </p>



<p>So the artist &#8211; &#8220;Zach,&#8221; draws fully colored, elaborate funny comics to quick rough photographed sketches. And subjects range from absurd to relatable with everything in- between and sometimes both at once. It&#8217;s tite, mate!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Safely Endangered</h2>



<p>So you love oxymorons and fun play of words?! Then this webcomic&#8217;s art style is cute, minimalistic, and quite charming and made just for you. All funny comics have a very feel-good end to themselves, making you chuckle even on days when grumpy is your mood of the day. </p>



<p>The artist, Chris, encapsulates lives of both animate and inanimate objects. A series of really funny comics that you can&#8217;t help but share with others.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Adam Ellis Comics</h2>



<p>Adam Ellis Comics are downright the best slapstick funny comics on the internet today! Many comics become monotonous with time, but not this one, also because it comes from a lot of personal encounters that the comic artist likes to display. Hilarious, unexpected, quirky and unforgiving &#8211; these comics are everything we need today!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Poorly Drawn Lines</h2>



<p>The artist Reza Farazmand has this charming way to tell stories in just four blocks through her minimal linework funny comics. Our favorite part is that the characters are mostly animals (we want to know what&#8217;s happening in their world!!!), but there are occasional visits from plants, rocks, and even humans (didn&#8217;t see it coming, did you?)</p>



<p>Overall a great series of funny comics with gripping conversational writing! Moreover it&#8217;s a very light read, which pairs excellently with evening coffee and WFH stress.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Sarah Andersen Comic</h2>



<p>We feel like squealing in excitement as this is one of our favorite funny comics on the internet! It has a nonchalance that pulls you in from the first read, and you keep reading because it&#8217;s so honest and relatable. If we could we&#8217;d give it 13/10 because we love it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. The Awkward Yeti </h2>



<p>Who knows the daily battles of the heart and the mind more than us? The Awkward Yeti! An ongoing gag-a-day funny comics by Nick Seluk, the comic follows the daily life of the blue yeti Lars. It&#8217;s intense, absolutely hilarious discussions between the body organs which anyone would relate to (unless you&#8217;re an alien, in which case, we&#8217;re calling the Men In Black).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. War &amp; Peas </h2>



<p>Created by Elizabeth Pich and Jonathan Kunz, these funny comics are relatable AF! And what we love about these comic strips is the arbitrary humor. Just like their name, the comic is not only filled with funny random chuckle-worthy instances but also a voice that stands for social issues like deforestation &amp; racism.</p>
