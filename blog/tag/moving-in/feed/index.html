Whether you&#8217;re a recent college graduate or you’ve just decided to move out from your parent&#8217;s home, the idea of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/living-alone-for-the-first-time/">having a whole place to yourself</a> sounds exciting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stackumbrella.com%2Fessentials-for-renting-the-first-apartment%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3nZshKyY6sELnNnS7ABq1i&amp;ust=1646748073441000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAwQjhxqFwoTCICv4uSUtPYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ">Source</a></p>



<p>Spending the first few nights (or months, even) in your first apartment without having the essentials could leave you feeling uncomfortable or out of place. Usually, most people need to camp out in their new apartment for some time before all of their stuff arrives.</p>



<p>No matter what your reason is, you need to have several essentials readily available, so you don&#8217;t beat yourself over not having them later on.</p>



<p>It may seem overwhelming, but these must-have items will make the first days in your home convenient and enjoyable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-1-mattress">1. Mattress</h3>



<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be nice to sleep on the cold, hard floor, so buying a comfy mattress and sheets should be the first thing you do. If you really like to feel relaxed, throw in your duvet, comforter, pillows, and anything else you think will make for a good night’s rest.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-2-important-furniture">2. Important furniture</h3>



<p>Say a family member or friend comes over to check out your awesome place. Where would they sleep? This is why it’s good to invest in important <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/affordable-furniture-shops-when-living-in-nyc/">sleeping</a> furniture like a couch or even a sleeper sofa before fully moving into your apartment.</p>



<p>And we can’t possibly forget your table and chairs! Except you’re a couch potato, it’ll be nice to have somewhere to eat that’s not on the sofa. If you feel this is too much, you can buy some barstools or even a coffee table instead. Renting is also a great option to try, especially if you’re forecasting shifting houses frequently.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-3-chargers">3. Chargers</h3>



<p>Carry all the chargers for every essential electronic device in your possession such as your phone, laptop, tablet, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-4-or-invest-in-some-spare-batteries">4. Or invest in some spare batteries</h3>



<p>If you have any important items that are non-rechargeable, then hold on to some spare batteries so that you don’t get stranded.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-5-kitchen-and-food-supplies">5. Kitchen and food supplies</h3>



<p>Buying takeout every day will cost you a lot of money in the long run, so why not get the necessary kitchen supplies so you can cook and eat comfortably? You don’t have to pack so much food, but get some easy-to-make staples like pasta and sauce, a few boxes of your favorite cereal and milk, bread and peanut butter, canned soup, etc.</p>



<p>You’ll also need to buy beverages like bottled water, tea bags, and coffee.</p>



<p>Depending on how long you plan on staying, you can buy some snacks too, especially those that don’t require preparation or refrigeration, like granola and nuts.</p>



<p>If you don’t want to use paper plates and cups, buy pots, pans, a strainer, a can opener, a vegetable peeler, knives, utensils, plates, kitchen towels, oven mitt, and whatever else you think will make eating and cooking easy for you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-6-basic-cleaning-supplies">6. Basic Cleaning Supplies</h3>



<p>Make sure you have the basic cleaning supplies ready so that you don’t deal with too much to clean on the move-in day. Get glass cleaners, multi-surface cleaners like white vinegar, dish soap, rags, a broom and dustpan, paper towels, and trash bags.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-7-a-basic-first-aid-kit">7. A Basic First Aid Kit</h3>



<p>It’s possible to get a few nicks or injuries as you move things around. We dearly hope you don’t. This is why you should be ready with Band-Aids, antibiotic ointment, a thermometer, anti-inflammatory like Advil, tweezers, some antiseptic wipes, an Ace bandage, and a few ibuprofen.</p>



<p>If you have any medication you take daily, then you should stock up or ensure there’s a place you can get them near your apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-8-keys">8. Keys</h3>



<p>If you tend to lose your keys, get spare ones made and keep them in safe places that you won’t easily forget.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-9-clothes">9. Clothes</h3>



<p>Seems pretty obvious, doesn&#8217;t it? Still, make sure you pack enough clothing for your brief stay before all your stuff comes in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-10-toiletries">10. Toiletries</h3>



<p>You may not be living in the apartment fully, but you need to take care of yourself. Don’t forget to pack important toiletries like soap, shampoo, moisturizing cream, shaving cream, toothbrush and toothpaste, deodorant, plus towels and washcloths for cleaning up.</p>



<p>Also, get yourself a tube of sunblock. You most likely would spend a lot of time in the sun trying to run errands and getting yourself together before you finally move in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-11-a-small-home-toolkit">11. A Small Home Toolkit</h3>



<p>Don’t underestimate having basic tools like a hammer, screwdriver, pliers, some duct tape, scissors, and even a step stool. They can come in handy during your short stay and even move-in day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-12-flashlight-or-headlamp">12. Flashlight or Headlamp</h3>



<p>It’s always good to carry candles or a flashlight in your first apartment. If there’s ever a power outage, the above will keep you from banging into stuff and stumbling in darkness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-13-important-documents-and-phone-numbers">13. Important Documents and Phone Numbers</h3>



<p>It’s good to be well prepared, so you should bring along&nbsp;important documents such as your driver’s license, passport, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi/">lease</a> (if applicable), etc. You’ll also need some paper and pens to make to-do lists.</p>



<p>Make sure your contact list has the phone numbers of your moving company, your financial institutions like your bank and insurance company, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/">your landlord</a>, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-14-credit-cardcash">14. Credit Card/Cash</h3>



<p>Don’t forget to carry your credit card(s) along. Keep some cash with you as well, in case something pops up, and you need to take care of it quickly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="15-15-a-treat">15. A treat</h3>



<p>Let’s face it: moving into an apartment isn’t easy. With all the heavy lifting and walking around that awaits you during move-in day, nobody would blame you for trying to treat yourself first.</p>



<p>Do anything that makes you feel relaxed, like reading a book, enjoying a good movie, or even sipping some wine. It’ll go a long way in relieving stress and helping you get accustomed to living in your new apartment.</p>
