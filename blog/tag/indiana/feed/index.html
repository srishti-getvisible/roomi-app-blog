<p>Then, MedLink debuted in 2013 connecting Parkview Regional Medical Center with Parkview Health&#8217;s Randallia campus. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that, despite annual ridership of 2.2 million, less than 1% of residents commute by public transportation.</p>



<p>Additionally, Fort Wayne is served by two intercity bus providers: Greyhound Lines (Indianapolis—Toledo—Detroit) and Lakefront Lines (Chicago—Columbus—Akron).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cycling</strong></h3>



<p>In 2016, the city introduced its first bike-sharing program, including five stations and 25 bicycles. For bike enthusiasts in Fort Wayne, this cycling program included biking lanes, trails, biking boxes, and sharrows. There are more than 120 miles of multi-use trails overall. So it&#8217;s safe to say that Fort Wayne’s growing trail truly offers a whole plethora of choices for cyclists — all along rivers and green spaces!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healthcare in Fort Wayne</strong></h2>



<p>Fort Wayne is served by ten medical centers belonging to one of two regional healthcare providers in the city. Notably the Parkview Health System and Lutheran Health Network.</p>
