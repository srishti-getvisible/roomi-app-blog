										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 was the year we all learned to live with the “new normal”. We weren’t happy about it, but we got on with things to protect each other. It was a year full of surprises and uncertainties, with industries like travel and real estate taking a knock bigger than any other we can remember. Rent reports said that homeowners, landlords, and tenants all over the world were forced into uncomfortable situations. And at multiple points throughout the year, moving house seemed impossible, with rent prices on a predicted increase. This is why Roomi’s 2020 Year in Review is so interesting. </p>



<p>We took a look at some key data collected over the year of unprecedented times, to uncover how COVID-19 impacted the room rental market in the United States.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There was more urgency amongst people moving to a new city</h2>



<p>There was a lot more moving and shifting between cities in 2020, compared to previous years. It seems like the pandemic is the underlying reason for this, with previous research finding that many renters were either forced out of their homes due to job loss, etc. and many chose to leave more expensive cities in search of somewhere more affordable to work remotely from.</p>



<p>Roomi’s users in particular were in a hurry to either find a roommate or a new place to live. Repeat purchases were up 18% compared to 2018, and a much higher percentage of users on the app actually made a purchase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rent prices continued to decrease steadily</h2>



<p>As reported in our<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-december-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> December room rental report</a>, the price to rent a room decreased throughout the year &#8211; which could be as a result of landlords dropping rent in order to keep rooms filled, instead of empty.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tech migration</h2>



<p>In 2020, Roomi also experienced what has been called “The Great Tech Migration”. People were migrating throughout the country. And all patterns were different to pre-pandemic activity. We witnessed a clear desire to move out into the suburbs. This was noted as people moved from major cities and tech hubs. </p>



<p>It seemed that cities that were bustling at just the start of the year 2020 (such as San Francisco and New York City) experienced more out-migration. And places such as Madison and Cleveland gained the most movers. How temporary or permanent these measures are, we don’t know just yet.</p>



<p>For now, it seems that places like NYC lost their appeal in many ways. It went from a bustling tech hub, with fantastic nightlife, culture, opportunities, and prime shopping streets. To a place that felt empty. For that reason, many people moved to the suburbs. To live with their parents or find cheaper rent. Since they could now work remotely and no longer had to worry about being close to their workplace.</p>

<p>As we make the shift into the final month of the year, we thought it was about time we took a look at Roomi’s Rent Report. We’re lucky here at Roomi because we get to share this exclusive information with our community. This report entails the cost of single rooms instead of entire apartments! Kind of perfect for those soloists looking for their next dream place across the states. So, if you’re looking to splash the cash and live in one of the hottest spots, or you’re searching for a room in an in-demand city where your money goes further, this is a great place to start. Do check out our October 2020 Roomi rent report in the US.<br><br><strong>Related: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-october-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi Rent Report: Average U.S. Room Prices in October 2020</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are our observations from the November rent report in the US?</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. According to the Roomi room report: San Francisco secures the top spot</h3>



<p><strong>Roomi fact: </strong><mark>If you’d been looking for a room in September or October, you’d have spent the most money by settling in New York City.</mark></p>



<p>This month, however, San Francisco takes back its title as the most expensive city to live in the United States.</p>



<p>But what is it that consistently drives the cost of SF living upwards? Well, the obvious reason is the area’s booming tech industry and proximity to Silicon Valley. San Francisco has the 3rd highest number of billionaires in the country, and the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-expensive-is-san-francisco-mind-blowing-facts-2019-5?r=US&amp;IR=T#1-the-bay-area-is-home-to-more-wealthy-people-than-any-other-of-the-most-populous-us-metro-areas-according-to-the-us-census-1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">median household income</a> is 74% higher than the overall country’s median.</p>



<p>If you still want to live in USA’s most high-end cities, you could consider some affordable neighborhoods. Bayview is one of the city’s cheapest neighborhoods, as well as Haight-Ashbury, Lone Mountain and Outer Sunset. That means that even if you’re a student, are new to the city, or make a limited income, you can still get close to the action around the bay area.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. The state of California continues to rise in cost</h3>



<p>In addition to San Francisco, the cost to rent a room in San Diego and Los Angeles has also risen this month. San Diego has gone from an average of $925/month in October to $1030/month in November, and LA has experienced a more subtle jump, going from $1181 to $1212.</p>



<p>When it comes to apartments in LA, the opposite appears to be true. According to an <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-11-23/rent-falling-los-angeles-rising-suburbs-inland-empire" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">article from the LA Times</a>, the estimated rent for an apartment in LA County has decreased 5.3% since the start of the year. </p>



<p>One potential reason for the increase in the cost of single rooms could be that individuals are starting to flock back to big cities. When coronavirus first began spreading, it had our jobs, health and sense of safety in its claws. Naturally, professionals that were able to work remotely left the more expensive cities to pursue cheaper rent elsewhere. The fact that California room rates are rising this month suggests the 3 Californian cities in our research are once again looking more attractive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Generous concessions are driving Gen-Z to re-enter the rental market</h3>



<p>Perhaps the most prominent trend noted in this rent report in the US.  Alongside the strong desire for many to return back to normal, generous concessions are also to thank for Generation Z’s dramatic entry back into the rental market. Whereas earlier on in the year, many chose to move back in with their parents. However, now benefits such as rent breaks, free parking, and reduced security deposits are luring them back.<br>A Zillow survey found that as many as <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.globest.com/2020/11/19/generous-concessions-drive-gen-z-back-to-the-rental-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">49% of Gen Z renters</a> had chosen to leave home and start renting again due to these concessions. It’s estimated that the price breaks meant renters could save the equivalent of two months of rent, in Boston, Chicago, Indianapolis, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.<br><br>That&#8217;s all in our Roomi rent report, for now, stay tuned for a monthly analysis!<br><br><strong>D’you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find average room prices via our exclusive Roomi Rent Report?

<p>It was interesting to see the impact that coronavirus had on rent prices in the U.S. We at Roomi have been keeping a close eye on the data we have at our disposal. Contrary to many predictions, we came to realize that the virus <em>did not </em>deter most people from living with near-strangers. To our surprise, it turns out that, renting a room instead of an entire apartment was preferable. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/guide-to-renting-cheap-apartments-in-new-york-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">This was due to the many money-saving possibilities.</a> Roomi&#8217;s rent report seeks to determine rental patterns w.r.t. room prices and demographics.</p>



<p>When you’re trying to decide between living with roommates vs. living alone, the cost of living has no doubt come into the equation. Of course, the average cost of renting a room varies pretty substantially between U.S. cities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Check out this graph that shows Roomi’s exclusive data. This is based on the average cost to rent a room in these top 10 cities in the United States.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why has San Francisco dropped to #3?</h2>



<p>When compiling this rent report, we noticed a considerable shuffling in city positions between August and September. With the standout comparison being San Francisco. In August, SF had the most expensive room prices, with an average rent price of $1597 on average. In September, this dropped to $1143 and the city was overtaken in cost by both NYC and Miami.</p>



<p>But why? San Francisco has seen a steady drop in rent prices this year. For instance, in July, the average room prices were as high as $1615. Historically, rent prices in San Fran have only gone up, and this plummet has been a real shock for both renters and landlords. The drop could be a result of what <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/slideshow/San-Francisco-rental-prices-fall-june-11-percent-204756.php" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Zumper calls “pandemic pricing</a>”. With major companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Square rolling out permanent work-from-home policies, people could be choosing to leave the Bay area to work remotely in more affordable spots.</p>



<p>Rising unemployment levels in the area could also be a factor &#8211; many landlords are having to adjust their asking price to get rooms filled, or offering temporary rent reduction to tenants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The growth of Philadelphia’s rental market</h2>



<p>The average monthly price of a room in Philly has dropped from $909 in August to $663 in September. But it seems that this decrease is an anomaly for the city during the past year or two and largely, Philadelphia has been one to watch for rent increases.</p>



<p>Perhaps the decline is another case of pandemic pricing, but if we look at the trends before COVID-19 hit, we’re noticing that some of Philadelphia’s most desirable neighborhoods were only on the up. Forbes has actually pinpointed the area as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ingowinzer/2020/06/04/the-best-markets-for-real-estate-investment-during-the-coronovirus/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the markets most likely to return to good growth</a>.</p>



<p>A potential reason for the growth could be the fact that Philadelphia has some of the most affordable houses to buy; it has an affordability index of 1 out of 10. With 10 being the least affordable. More people are choosing to buy places in the area and rent them out for a profit. On top of that, the quality of life in Philadelphia is undoubtedly a good one; it’s been consistently rated as one of the <a href="https://selectgreaterphl.com/quality-of-life/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">best places to visit in the U.S.</a>, and by the looks of things, many of those tourists decide to stick around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A rising population, increasing job opportunities, and low cost of living all come together to make Philadelphia a market to watch.</p>
