										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After a long day of work, the last thing any of us want to do is go slog in the kitchen for a half-decent meal. I mean cooking just involves so many steps. There’s the washing, the chopping, the actual cooking, and then if that’s not enough, there’s also the clean-up afterwards. So, it’s no surprise most of us end up getting DoorDash meals most work nights. But now those bills are adding up on your card and you’re wondering if there’s anyway to make cooking easier. Well, this is where Roomi comes in. We’ve got 5 great kitchen tricks for you that will change your life. Whether you’ve never stepped foot in a kitchen before, or you’re a professional chef, these kitchen hacks will appeal to all. So, sit back and watch us blow your mind with these amazing kitchen tips and hacks!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Easy ginger trick: One of the greatest kitchen hacks</h2>



<p>Ginger is something that most of us have in our pantry. They add so much flavor to food and have so much nutritional value. Not to mention, <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-ginger-tea-3377239" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ginger tea</a> is one of God’s greatest creations and we stand by that. But for how delicious they are, they can be quite a pain in the ass. I mean, peeling ginger is one of the most annoying things on the planet. I mean, a ginger root has so many nooks and crannies that peeling it takes <em>forever</em>.</p>



<p>So, here’s one of our great kitchen tricks: Scrap the skin of the ginger with a spoon, don’t bother doing it with a knife. And wherever it gets too tough… leave the skin on. There’s no harm in consuming ginger skin, so why bother trying to get every bit of it off! Isn’t that so liberating?!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kitchen hacks for the soul: Peeling garlic</h2>



<p>If you’re like us, you want to put garlic on everything. I mean, why not? It’s one of the most delicious flavors on this planet. Honestly, we’ve never listened to recipes when they ask us to use 3 garlic cloves. It’s double or nothing for us! Which is what makes this trick one of the best kitchen tips in the world. Peeling garlic is the most boring part of cooking. So, what if we told you that you can actually peel up to 20 garlics in under 20 seconds? Sounds insane, right? But it really isn’t. Check out this video on how to do it. It truly is one of the best kitchen hacks! </p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Microwave your veggies</h2>



<p>This is one of our favorite kitchen tips/hacks ever! If you’ve ever tried to cook roasted potatoes on a Wednesday night, you’re keenly aware of how long it takes to cook them through. Cooking vegetables often takes a very long time, which can be very annoying when all you want is a quick and healthy meal. So in order to cut your cooking time in half, microwave your veggies first. Yes, it’s that easy! Place your veggies in a pot of water and then stick it in the microwave. You can do this with any vegetable that takes a bit long to cook on the stove. How long you need to microwave veggies for will vary based on the veggie and the strength of your microwave. Just make sure it&#8217;s soft when you cut into it. Yeah, it’s that easy!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of the easiest kitchen hacks: pre-cut veggies</h2>



<p>From the list so far, you can probably deduce that veggies take up most of our problems in the kitchen. And this is one of those great kitchen tricks that will finish off all the trouble that comes with cooking veggies. BUY PRE-CUT VEGGIES. It will absolutely change your life. Between these two kitchen tips, this one and the microwave one, you’re going to cut down your cooking time to under 10 minutes. Isn’t that amazing?! So, the next time you go to the grocery store, don’t even bother with whole veggies. Go straight for the <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/7-tips-for-getting-the-most-nutrition-from-bagged-and-pre-cut-veggies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-cut stuff</a>!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Weekly Meal Preps </h2>



<p>Okay, we’d all like to be one of those people who work the whole day and then come back home and cook to relax. That would be amazing. But most of us don’t have the patience for it and that’s okay! So, what you can do is do a weekly meal prep. Cook maybe twice a week when your schedule is light and then eat those meals through the week. </p>



<p>This is one of those great kitchen tricks that’s best for people who like cooking in bulk. This also helps you think about the meals you will eat the coming week and you can prepare in advance. I mean, how many times have you stood in the middle of your kitchen and wondered what the hell you should cook for dinner? Well, meal prep takes care of that problem. Just cook your <a href="https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/how-to-meal-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meals</a> beforehand and then have a stress free week!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One good thing our shelter in place has given us is time! The time to look at and appreciate the little things in life. And the time to learn new things. Which for many of us has included learning the art of cooking, and the lessons learned from cooking.</p>



<p>Browsing a plethora of recipes that look easy, but later prove to be not so easy can make us feel that we&#8217;re just no good in the kitchen. But like any other skill, the art of cooking can be tough &#8211; but it is 100% rewarding once we get into the swing of things.</p>



<p>The rewards come with our openness to the lessons that can be learned from cooking, make mistakes, and have fun along the way. The good thing about cooking is it gives you time to take in each moment in and think about life outside the kitchen too!</p>



<p>So apart from enjoying deliciously burnt meals, here are some life lessons we learned from cooking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Just a little patience</h2>



<p>When cooking, it&#8217;s tough for us impatient folk to stand in front of the burning stove, constantly wondering, &#8216;Is it done yet?&#8217; Try this instead. Look at the bubbling water and the color-changing veggies in your pan and listen intently to the way they cook. In the art of cooking, a great lesson is to forget everything else and focus on the present moment.</p>



<p>This lesson learned from cooking can be applied to other parts of your life. For example, when you get impatient and want to get rid of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/5-steps-to-get-rid-of-bad-habits-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad habits</a> overnight, or think you can achieve success in the blink of an eye. Try to enjoy the moment that is now, instead of constantly wondering about <em>when</em> it will be done.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. To new beginnings&#8230; and the mistakes that come with it</h2>



<p>When we <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/cooking-basics-for-everyone-4684010" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">start learning how to cook</a>, we might expect we can follow a recipe to the T and make the best dish we ever tasted on our very first try!</p>



<p>However, a hard lesson learned from cooking is that we need to accept that this might not be the case. If it is, well, kudos to you! But the fact is &#8211; for most of us &#8211; things take time, and we rarely get it right on the very first try.</p>



<p>So the best way to deal with this is to accept that we might make mistakes and embrace the learnings &#8211; inside the kitchen and outside.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Lesson learned from cooking: Perfection is overrated</h2>



<p>One life lesson that the art of cooking teaches us is &#8211; nothing comes out perfect. When you&#8217;re just starting, you probably can&#8217;t even grill toast just right! But fretting about it and assuming that cooking is &#8216;just not for you&#8217; is of no help. Like they say &#8211; practice makes perfect!</p>



<p>And so we can apply this lesson learned from cooking in every day life too! We need to stop waiting for the perfect moment, the perfect opportunity, and the perfect person to come along. If we work with what we have, we&#8217;ll slowly realize perfection has always been overrated!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. It&#8217;s okay to be clueless about what we&#8217;re doing</h2>



<p>Ever stepped into the kitchen with your recipe book and ingredients feeling like a pro &#8211; just to realize you have to Google what &#8216;poaching your eggs&#8217; means or &#8216;how will I know the potatoes have boiled&#8217;? Same here!</p>



<p>The fact is it&#8217;s PERFECTLY NORMAL to be clueless about what you&#8217;re doing when you&#8217;re a beginner at something. The lesson learned from cooking here is that the process and the result teach us more than our doubts can. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Lesson learned from cooking: Listening to our gut</h2>



<p>The recipe tells you to add &#8216;salt as per taste&#8217;, but how are you supposed to know how much that is?! Well, no one really does. So listen to your gut and your taste buds while mixing and cooking.</p>



<p>The same applies when it comes to paying attention to our instincts in general life. The thing to keep in mind is &#8211; even listening to ourselves takes practice. The more we communicate with ourselves, the better we&#8217;ll be able to hear what our gut has to say.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Hard work always pays off</h2>



<p>Just like dreaming about making the most <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/delicious-thanksgiving-dinner-ideas-to-beat-2020-blues-veggie-vegan-options-included/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">delicious Thanksgiving dinner</a> but not actually doing it (and ordering in instead) won&#8217;t give you much satisfaction, if you want something in life, you have to put in the hard work. It can be frustrating at first, but trust that there&#8217;ll be a good reward in the end. And whatever you make &#8211; it will be your very own labor of love you can be proud of!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Garnishing with a pinch of love</h2>



<p>What no recipe tells us and what makes mom&#8217;s spaghetti so delicious is the ingredient of love! If you cook just for the sake of cooking, seeing it as a chore, the result will also be just for the sake of filling your stomach as opposed to the case of the yummies. So even if you&#8217;re cooking for one, pour some love into it and see the magical results.</p>



<p>Similarly, in life, whatever you do &#8211; do it with love and watch it transform into something wonderful right in front of your eyes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Lesson learned from cooking: Discipline is underrated</h2>



<p>A recipe might display the cooking time as 10 minutes, but if you&#8217;re a beginner or like to take things slow &#8211; you might take 30, and that&#8217;s alright!</p>



<p>In life, your friends or acquaintances might have reached phases you&#8217;re not even close to reaching. But that shouldn&#8217;t demotivate you. Take things at your own pace and keep your own end goals in mind, and you&#8217;ll slowly but surely get there!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Appreciating the ones that feed us</h2>



<p>One of the greatest life lessons learned from cooking is that we&#8217;ve always undervalued how much time and effort goes into feeding other people. So be it your grandfather, your aunt, your sibling, or a roomi who loves to cook for everyone, don&#8217;t forget to tip them with loads of appreciation and love.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Messy is fun!</h2>



<p>Last but not least, cooking, like life, is MESSY! So put some good music on. Pour half a glass of wine, and groove to the rhythm of the stove burner! Because having fun is the spice of life.</p>

<p>Yes, we all thought of banana bread extensively when giving cooking in quarantine a shot. Yes, we all familiarized ourselves with the cast of the BA Test Kitchen. And we&#8217;re also pretty sure all of us created at least a few blunders in the kitchen.</p>



<p>At first, you may have thought, &#8216;How tough can it be? I have excellent chefs from all around the world at my disposal with a simple click into YouTube.&#8217;</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/5-useful-new-skills-to-learn-during-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">You thought all you had to do was Google a recipe</a>, gather your ingredients, and start creating your feast. And when you resort to eating ramen or mac n cheese for dinner every day, you slowly realize the contrary is true.</p>



<p>But you know what they say &#8211; practice makes perfect. But with irregular work hours and untimely Netflix binge on the weekends, it is a bit tough to keep up with the practice.</p>



<p>So we thought we&#8217;d share some blunderous areas of cooking in quarantine that might give you some consolation &#8211; that you are NOT alone!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Following recipes when you&#8217;re cooking in quarantine.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Expectation:</em></h3>



<p>The tutorial chefs make cooking in quarantine look so easy! You think you can do an excellent job out of it. Maybe you&#8217;ll post it on your social media feed and flaunt your new skills. Your friends and family will talk about how amazing and mouth-watering your dish looks. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/9-reasons-why-living-with-a-roommate-is-awesome-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">You might make some for your roomis too</a>, making them do your share of washing the dishes in return. You can&#8217;t wait to start!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Reality:</em></h3>



<p>&#8216;Hello. Mom? How long should I leave the potatoes to boil? Should I boil on low flame or full heat? Which utensils should I use?&#8217;</p>



<p>Or you find yourself googling these questions. And slowly, the 20 minutes cooking time turns into 2 hours (and you&#8217;re really hungry).</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tip:</em></h4>



<p>Practice! Start with the easiest recipes, and you will slowly start getting the hang of it. Don&#8217;t be afraid to make mistakes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cutting veggies</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Expectation:</em></h3>



<p>You&#8217;re excited to use your new and never used before chef&#8217;s knife. You think crying because of onions is weak. You think you&#8217;ll make it through without a cut. Cooking in quarantine is your jam.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Reality:</em></h3>



<p>You realize you can&#8217;t cut vegetables to save your life. You see the vegetables fly off the chopping board to save their own lives. You&#8217;re crying like a baby: because of the onions, and because of everything else. You are your own version of vampire diaries with the taste for your bleeding fingers.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tip:</em></h4>



<p>Go slow and give yourself time. Accept the fact that you&#8217;re no Masterchef &#8211; and watch those fingers!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cleaning dirty dishes!</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Expectation:</em></h3>



<p>You see YouTube recipe tutorials and figure you should have separate bowls for each ingredient, as shown. You think you wouldn&#8217;t mind washing those dishes later. You&#8217;ll manage it like a pro.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Reality:</em></h3>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-roomate-is-a-slob/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">You treat your dishes like you treat your problems</a>, thinking if you don&#8217;t look at them, they will magically go away. Washing dishes in quarantine has made you hate cooking.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tip:</em></h3>



<p>While you wait for food to cook or boil, instead of losing your patience, rinse the dishes that aren&#8217;t being used anymore.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cooking with wine, quarantine or not.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Expectation:</em></h3>



<p>It&#8217;s the weekend. You and your roommates decide to cook an elaborate dinner with wine. This could either mean you&#8217;re thinking of using wine as an ingredient or drinking wine while cooking, or maybe a little bit of both. So you pop the cork and pour yourself some before starting. It&#8217;ll be the best meal you&#8217;ve ever made; you like to think.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Reality:</em></h3>



<p>One glass leads to another, and before you know it, you and your roomi have made the switch from glasses &#8211; to entire bottles. You&#8217;re drunk and hungry. You go for the frozen food in the freezer instead.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tip:</em></h4>



<p>Two words for you: Moderation and will power! Plus, if you drink after the food is made and before you proceed to eat, your food will taste much better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cleaning the mess that you&#8217;ve made</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Expectation:</em></h3>



<p>You improvise with Frank Ocean&#8217;s &#8216;Thinking &#8217;bout you&#8217;, singing about a tornado that made a mess in your kitchen, and how it usually doesn&#8217;t rain flour and veggies. You will clean like you mean it and will be done before you know it.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:75%">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Reality:</em></h3>



<p>Your slab&#8217;s a mess, your floor is a mess, your dirty dishes are still in the sink, and you&#8217;ll only come back to it when you plan to cook next.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tip:</em></h4>



<p>The more you delay, the tougher it will get. Tackle the dishes and clean the kitchen while your food is getting cooked. You&#8217;ll thank yourself later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s cooking? Is it good looking?</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Expectations:</em></h3>



<p>You can&#8217;t wait to flaunt your culinary perfection. It will be mouth-watering and delicious looking.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Reality:</em></h3>



<p>Your food turned out to be a hot pile of mess!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:100%">
