										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 has been a year of unexpected and disruptive disasters all around the globe. While many of these can be predictable, some pop out of nowhere, like the 2020 pandemic. Natural disaster preparation accounts for all of these situations; it helps you stay combat-ready for what may come<em>.&nbsp;</em>September of every year is the National Disaster Preparedness Month. Therefore, here are some vital disaster preparation tips ranging from emergency alerts, first aid kits, and all that you should know to stay prepared.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Disaster preparation 101: Know what to expect</h2>



<p>Each crisis calls for different treatment, preparation, supplies, and essentials. Part of disaster preparation is identifying what disasters your town or city is prone to. Next, plan accordingly. Here&#8217;s a list of the most common disasters:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">1. <strong><em>Storms &amp; Hurricanes</em></strong></h3>



<p>Places close to water bodies need to keep their eyes out for this. The East &amp; Gulf coasts are most prone to these disasters, especially between June and November.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">2. <strong><em>Earthquakes</em></strong></h3>



<p>No place can be labeled as disaster-free. Yes, not even landlocked regions<strong>.</strong>Â As tectonic plate movements are unpredictable, earthquakes can take place at any time of the year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">3. <strong><em>Floods</em></strong></h3>



<p>People living in low-lying land are at the most risk of this calamity. This includes places like Georgia, Massachusetts, North &amp; South Carolina, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">4. <strong><em>Wildfires</em></strong></h3>



<p>After the heart-wrenching Californian wildfires, all states with huge forest land and little rains are areas of concern.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">5. <strong><em>Tornadoes</em></strong></h3>



<p>TX, OK, IA, KS, NE, and OH are on high alert from March to August.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">6. <strong><em>Blizzards</em></strong></h3>



<p><em>They can happen in any region where the temperature drops below the freezing point.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Disaster preparation for your home and your homies  </h2>



<p>Before leaving home, there are a few things to check. Make sure to disconnect all electrical appliances such as the air conditioner, microwave, lamps, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">1. <strong><em>Pantry</em></strong></h3>



<p>Store all your emergency goods properly. In case of a flood alert, store all of your dry food items in a water-resistant box and on high shelves where water can&#8217;t reach.  When there is a flood warning, you can store goods like milk, fresh meat, and poultry in the freezer to increase shelf life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">2. <strong><em>Essentials</em></strong></h3>



<p>Always have extra of the essentials stacked at home. These include medicines, personal sanitation, food, and water.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">3. <strong><em>Evacuation</em></strong></h3>



<p>Plan and practice your evacuation routes with all your house members. It will ensure you all are well-versed with the course when disaster strikes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">4. <strong><em>Standard Medical Procedures</em></strong></h3>



<p>Simultaneously, now may be a good time to get acquainted with different medical procedures. For example, basic first aid, CPR, reviving someone who drowned, Heimlich maneuver, how to move an injured person and how to stop bleeding. </p>
