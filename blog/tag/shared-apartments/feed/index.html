<p>It is cheaper and a lot more convenient to do your laundry at home, this is usually a fun and smooth process but it can be different when there is shared laundry in an apartment, basically sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment. This is an <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.chicagonow.com/medium-rare/2016/04/moral-dilemma-in-the-laundry-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">unending chore</a> and it should be fun and done right. Below are some laundry room etiquettes one should follow for a happy coliving experience! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Laundry Room Etiquette 101</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cleanliness</h3>



<p>Keep the laundry room tidy, especially when it’s a shared laundry in an apartment. When there are spills, you clean it up and clean out the lint trap, change it after every use and throw away drying sheets and empty detergent wraps. There’s potential for a mess when sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment but can be kept to a bare minimum with intentional efforts like cleaning thoroughly after use. If not done properly, it can cause slipping hazards and in the case of spilling bleach, it can ruin someone’s clothes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Time</h3>



<p>Maximize your time so you don’t waste other’s time. Don’t monopolize the machines. Please don’t leave your dirty clothes sitting in the washer or dryer while someone else is waiting for a machine in a shared laundry in an apartment. Time your laundry, you surely do not want someone else removing your clothes and placing them on the machine or your clothes getting dirty by being tossed aside or collecting mold from being left in the washer for too long.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reservation</h3>



<p>You can’t reserve a machine in a shared laundry in an apartment when you are not ready. Being busy is not an excuse for reserving a dryer if you are not actively using a machine especially when you are sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preparation</h3>



<p>Sorting out your clothes for laundry saves time. treat stains in advance this helps to maximize your time so you don’t leave others waiting for a machine. You can get a <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/laundry-detergent-bag.html">different bag for your detergents</a>, softeners, and dryer sheets for easy access.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Respect</h3>



<p>Respect everyone’s space and belongings, ask to be sure if someone is using a machine so you don’t cause an awkward situation also do not monopolize the machines. Use a timer to ensure you get your clothes out on time so you don’t keep your neighbor waiting. This is very essential in a shared laundry in an apartment. This is to avoid being on bad terms with your neighbor. Don’t use someone else’s hamper without permission even if you are sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment and if you know you’d be late in getting your clothes, write a note and leave your laundry basket/hamper by the machine so the next person can help you place them neatly.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Patience</h3>



<p>Try to be patient when you notice that a washer or dryer has completed its cycle and the owner is not yet there to pack their clothes, never move anyone’s stuff if you can help it. You don’t want to have issues with someone’s personal belongings. They’ll be back soon. If they don’t return in time and you absolutely have to use a machine, it’s a good rule of laundry room etiquette to wait at least 10 to 20 minutes to see if the owner of the clothes is coming back for their laundry. After the time elapsed and their basket is present, gently place the laundry inside of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Does <em>living in NYC</em> and <em>zero waste living</em> really go hand in hand? Well, yes.</p>



<p>There are New Yorkers who have done and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zerowastehome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documented it. Meet Béa Johnson</a>. Her family of four generates only a small jar of waste each year. I know, we can&#8217;t believe it either. If this gets a little part of you excited to try it out too in your shared apartment, then you’re in the right place. Read on for a realistic New York guide to start your zero waste journey.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“Refuse what you do not need; reduce what you do need; reuse what you consume; recycle what you cannot refuse, reduce, or reuse; and rot (compost) the rest.” </em></p><cite><em>Bea Johnson on zero waste living in NYC</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>The key is to start slow and continue steadily. Take it a step at a time rather than trying to do zero waste life at once. The ultimate aim is a lifestyle that is both sustainable and comfortable to live. If you find it inconvenient, you are unlikely to stick to it in the long term.</p>



<p>To start out with, Roomi recommends the following tips.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Take stock of your buying habits</strong></h2>

<p>Carrying your own bag is a great start. The next step is being mindful about what you buy. Try bulk buying, so there’s no plastic packaging. Farmer’s markets often have products available that aren’t wrapped in plastic. Living in NYC also gives you access to some zero-waste stores, which makes sustainable shopping more straightforward.</p>



<p>Packaging takes up a lot of room in our waste-paper bins. So just by choosing products sold loose or with reusable packaging, you make a big difference!</p>



<p>Once you successfully practice zero waste shopping with your groceries, you can branch out. There&#8217;s a New York guide for almost everything, so it would be easy to find the right stores for sustainable shopping. Think clothes, cosmetics, and even vehicles.</p>

<p>Living in NYC is turning eco-friendly. The city has committed to reducing overall landfill waste by 2030. We have the largest composting program in the country, open to over 3.5 m residents.</p>



<p>The city has also partnered with non-profit organizations to redistribute pre-loved and reusable items. Instead of ending up in a landfill, second-hand products reach those in need through <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/donate/index.shtml" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">donateNYC</a> or <a href="https://www.housingworks.org/donate" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Housing Works</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Alternatively, you can compost at home for your plant babies! Composting is easy-peasy and can be done in any space. Even in a shared apartment or a condo. Trust us- your plants will thank you for it!

<p>There’s a common misconception that those who practice sustainability are somehow ‘missing out’ on common experiences enjoyed by others. This may have been true to some extent at the beginning of the movement but no longer. With more and more people seeing the value of a mindful, sustainable lifestyle, even restaurants in the city are looking toward zero-waste functioning. So, when it’s safe to go out again, you can take a break from your shared apartment (finally!) and enjoy a meal out without compromising your chosen lifestyle.</p>

<p>As we said at the beginning of this handy zero waste New York guide, this is just a practical place to begin. There’s a lot more you can do. Everyone&#8217;s zero waste journey looks different.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure once you get used to thinking about the sustainability of your habits, you&#8217;ll automatically be more mindful of your choices. Good luck to you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So you’re stuck coliving in the pandemic with a roommate you don’t particularly like. You have likely arrived here looking for an exit strategy from your shared apartment. Maybe a search for new apartments with roommates has already begun. Or perhaps you are at your wits&#8217; end and are now looking to escape to the depths of the Amazon forest to hide from all your problems.</p>



<p>Before the pandemic that shook our lives up, coliving in shared apartments was the trend of the decade. <strong>According to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/63-percent-of-millennial-homebuyers-have-regrets-heres-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> by the Urban Institutes Housing Finance Policy Center, only 1 in every 3 millennials under 25 reported actually owning a home in 2018.</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse">This statistic is a drastic shift from previous generations, with the total percentage of homeowners close to 8-9% less overall. It indicated a shift in the way younger folks are housing themselves.</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-your-roommate-make-your-life-a-living-hell" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">How did your coliving roommate make your life a living hell?</a></h2>



<p>Even before the pandemic, millennials’ wallets had been shrinking. This prompted people to hunt for apartments with roommates that fit a budget as well as social needs.</p>



<p>When you consider large cities like New York, close to 40% of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/coronavirus-quarantine-relationships-conflict-roommate-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people live in shared apartments</a> with roommates. <strong>But what if your roommate is a demon who has made your shared apartment your own personal hell?</strong></p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

	</div>
	


<p>We have all been here before, pandemic or not. Uncomfortable situations with your roommate can vary all the way from messy shared living spaces, piles of dirty dishes, to even interpersonal conflict. Whatever the trouble, it can be hard to survive in shared living spaces if you don’t like the people you are cohabitating with.</p>



<p>Moving out is often an easy and clear option, but even that has gotten trickier with the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of us have lost employment or are generally struggling with finances, making our options limited.</p>



<p><strong>If you must live on (if only to avoid moving back home to your parents), read on for some quick survival tips to keep you afloat from insanity in your coliving space.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Avoid angrily calling out your coliving partner, even if you’re mentally writing their eulogy</h2>



<p>Did you know that the United States&#8217; military during <a href="https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/Article/643229/the-american-wolf-packs-a-case-study-in-wartime-adaptation/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">World War II</a> paired submarine teammates based on how well they could support each other psychologically? <strong>It’s because confined coliving is actually the ultimate test of compatibility.</strong></p>



<p>So imagine your shared apartment as the battleground and your roommate and yourself as the submarine mates. <strong>To make coliving easier, try to hold out on your anger over small issues that might come up. If something really ticks you off, imagine your words as a wartime headline in newspapers the next day.</strong></p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/JO8y56O9mTmeY" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/JO8y56O9mTmeY/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Do you want the news to read, “Roommate chews off coliving partner’s head because they forgot to replace the toilet paper roll?” If that&#8217;s not the case, hold off for a bit. Take a deep breath and address the issue when you feel calmer.</p>



<p>According to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-surviving-quarantine-without-killing-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Coleman</a>, a Social Psychologist at Columbia, <strong>we need three positive encounters to every stinging remark that we make to maintain peace between both parties</strong>. So if you let that snarky remark pass off, you may need three ways to make up for the negative energy. Also, negative encounters in shared living spaces are remembered much more deeply.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Bring out the chalk, and draw a boundary in your shared apartment!</h2>



<p>Boundaries are everything when coliving in apartments with roommates. These boundaries have been blurred even more due to the amount of unstructured time we spend in our shared apartments.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:75%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/1BGRdWpe1auzG63NeC" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/1BGRdWpe1auzG63NeC/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If both you and your roommate use the living room at the same time, clashes are possible. Maybe a high-powered pilates class doesn’t go well in the background while you’re trying to concentrate on a physics lecture.</p>



<p>When physical space is limited, create structured time within your shared living spaces. <strong>If you and your coliving partner both wish to use a shared space, creating equal time blocks for use can help add a sense of separation and relief.</strong></p>



<p>Vary where you and your roommate are during different points in the day to avoid any clashes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Bonding through activities in your apartments with roommates</h2>



<p>Okay, so we previously established that your roommate is the cousin of the Devil himself. If you think there is still room to make amends in this coliving partnership, try to do low-pressure activities together that you both can reap the benefits of together.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p><strong>Examples include doing puzzles, painting, or even something simple like cooking a meal together.</strong> The pandemic may have forced the two of you into a shared living space together, but there are plenty of indoor activities to indulge in to create positive memories.</p>



<p><strong>USA Today even created a list of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2020/03/16/coronavirus-quarantine-100-things-do-while-trapped-inside/5054632002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100 things to do while stuck in quarantine.</a> You’re welcome.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Have a clear set of quarantine rules for shared living spaces</h2>



<p>Go back to the rulebook of coliving in shared apartments with roommates. A clear-cut and honest conversation about who does the chores, who gets the couch, and for how long always helps. Especially in the pandemic, you should have clear rules about who gets to come over into your shared living spaces.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:93%">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>You can even get together and write out the rules on a whiteboard and have it displayed like a constitution of your shared apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hide under the covers or behind a plant in your shared apartment</h2>



<p>When all else fails, hide under your covers if you absolutely wish to limit interaction with your coliving partner. You can simply act as if you’re asleep when you both are in the same shared living space in your home. Just pop on some earphones and breeze through TikTok videos to avoid social interaction altogether.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Seek legal support for help with the coliving struggle</h2>



<p>Sometimes we know when the final straw has dropped, and you cannot put up with your roommate&#8217;s antics anymore. On a more serious note, inappropriate behavior when coliving in a shared apartment is simply unacceptable.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>In the early throes of the pandemic, a friend of mine faced a similar unfavorable situation with their coliving partner. This roommate accused my friend of “being romantically interested” in his same-sex roommate, eventually getting him evicted. The situation turned serious- the landlord of the shared apartment refused to return the security deposit. This came as a shock to my friend, who was accused unfairly by his roommate.</p>



<p>He took the time to find out about his rights as a tenant and ultimately filed a legal complaint against the landlord in question. If you think you are in serious danger or trapped in an uncomfortable situation, there are resources that can help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You just got to the Big Apple, the target of all your hopes and dreams. Maybe you’re an aspiring actor trying to break into Broadway, or the burgeoning TV and movie scene? Maybe you are just looking to get out of your one traffic light town.</span> Or you just <span style="font-weight: 400;">like the hustle and bustle of the big city. &nbsp;But no one told you that the rent for an average studio is over two grand a month</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> And a one-bedroom is another thousand dollars on top of that. </span>Here&#8217;s what we have to say. Shared housing in Manhattan. Ever heard of that?</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, maybe the landlord takes firstborn children for the kind of apartments seen on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How I Met Your Mother</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but one shouldn’t assume such things. If you move in with a buddy, or even into a place with strangers, they can help you live those halcyon dreams of the upstart writer in New York, penning the next great American novel by day and pursuing craft cocktail bars in Williamsburg by night.</span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581004705471-d5177239ab1f?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="people walking on street during evening time towards an ice cream truck in manhattan NYC"/></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Okay, here&#8217;s some real talk.</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human beings are, by their natures, social beings. We crave to be around others, and loneliness is real when you’re all by yourself in your apartment on any given weeknight. Not to mention that housing in Manhattan is incredibly expensive, so splitting the load could make a really nice place with decent amenities.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let’s be real here, not all of those who want to share housing in Manhattan do so because of the rent cost. As mentioned in</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/realestate/sharing-a-new-york-apartment-by-choice.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are many who move in with others in the city who don’t have to, because they like the company, or because of cultural reasons. Those who like to have someone around the house, just to push away the silence of an otherwise empty place or to bounce ideas off. Some even don’t mind paying a little more to share an apartment with another.</span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1572201115533-ca2301dd6fad?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="man walking near station 14 fire station towards his shared housing in Manhattan NYC"/></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why should you consider shared housing in Manhattan?</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few reasons why finding a roommate could be a preferred mode of living</span> in Manhattan. Especially in place<span style="font-weight: 400;"> of striking out all on your own. Perhaps you always wanted a dog</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>B<span style="font-weight: 400;">ut don’t want all the responsibility of having a puppy of your own. Well, if your roomie has a pup, you’d probably get to pet the rascal all day long! </span>W<span style="font-weight: 400;">ithout needing to pick up any sidewalk treats in the rain and snow. Maybe you are new to the city and need someone to show you where the cool things are, living with locals can be like having your own personal Yelp page in the next room.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the idea of having a roommate becoming more acceptable in the American zeitgeist, there are many places where one can find someone they could platonically shack up with. <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://get.roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi</a></strong> has made it so simple for New Yorkers and out-of-towners to get what they want out of shared housing in Manhattan.</span></p>

Sometimes, just knowing that there is another warm body within your four walls could make<span style="font-weight: 400;"> all the difference.</span></p>
