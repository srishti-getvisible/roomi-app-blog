<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Astoria neighborhood has tons to offer for the price. At first glance, it might seem like a quiet, middle class neighborhood. And while that’s part of Astoria’s awesome personality, don’t let it fool you into thinking this place is boring. Delicious microbreweries, astounding Greek food, beautiful parks, and more await you in this incredibly diverse neighborhood. With so many designated bike paths, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains-part-2-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting around town</a> is easy if you don’t have a car.</span> Here&#8217;s Roomi&#8217;s Astoria neighborhood review for you! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Astoria neighborhood review: <b>Greek food lover and microbrewery enthusiast paradise</b></strong></h2>



<p>C<span style="font-weight: 400;">an’t get enough Greek food and you’ve never met a microbrewery you didn’t like</span>?<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Then the Astoria neighborhood offers more happiness in a few city blocks than all of paradise combined. Beer gardens and little mom-and-pop Greek restaurants are plentiful. </span>D<span style="font-weight: 400;">on’t have a specific destination in mind? Just taking a stroll through your own neighborhood will reveal all manner of delights.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Greek food, head on over to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tavern Kyclades. It isn’t just a top destination for Greek food within Astoria neighborhood. It ranks as one of the absolute best Greek restaurants in all of New York City. The interior has art based on the famous island chain in Greece</span>. And it&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">complete with the distinctive blue and white homes and idealistic beaches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For 25 microbrews on tap and full kitchen service until 1 AM, try</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunswick 35/35. The beer covers a range of options, from hoppy to mellow so everyone can find something they like. Hearty pub fare is on the menu</span>. B<span style="font-weight: 400;">ut so are more unusual options like wild mushroom fritters for the more explorative amongst you. They’ve also got trivia and bingo</span>!<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>W<span style="font-weight: 400;">hich is always a fun way to introduce yourself to the locals when you first arrive.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>Accessible and interesting art galleries and museums</b></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond its culinary experience, the Astoria neighborhood is a really educational place. Your first stop should be the</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://socratessculpturepark.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Socrates Sculpture Park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not only are there a bunch of outdoor sculptures for you to enjoy, but there are even art classes. They’re divided into adult, teen, and kids courses</span>. S<span style="font-weight: 400;">o whether you go with friends or family, you’ll have something you can enjoy. Music, festivals, farmers markets, and yoga are also available there.</span></p>
