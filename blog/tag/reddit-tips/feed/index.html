										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s the festive season! For some, that might mean partying like there&#8217;s no pandemic. For others, snuggling up indoors and laying in has always been the best kind of party. If you inhabit shared living spaces and you&#8217;re one of the latter kind, the chances are, you have neighbors who are of the former kind. While you might not mind the hum of conversation and laughter next door (plus you&#8217;re glad that you&#8217;re not experiencing the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social anxiety</a> of actually being at the party!), that doesn&#8217;t mean you have to deal with noisy neighbors.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re noticing a rise in the volume of the music, parties on the weekends, or loud movie marathons and discordant guitar practice on weeknights&#8230; the chances are, you&#8217;re growing tired of it.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/reddit-tips-for-when-you-cant-sleep-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding it hard to fall asleep</a> and losing your peace of mind, enough is enough&#8230;</p>



<p>So now, you finally decide to ask your neighbors in to keep the noise down.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>But then you hesitate about what to say or how to say it.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ve all been there! So when we couldn&#8217;t think of what to do, we browsed Reddit stories, naturally!</p>



<p>Here are some of our best Reddit stories and tips on how to deal with noisy neighbors when inhabiting shared living spaces.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jordanFromJersey/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/jordanFromJersey</a> gives advice on how to deal with noisy neighbors without saying a word to them.</strong></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>If you want to avoid being &#8220;that neighbor&#8221; then your options are limited mostly to things within your sphere of direct control. On that note, I would suggest the purchase of a cheap &#8220;white noise&#8221; machine, or (if there is a computer with speakers in your bedroom) download a white noise track and set it on repeat when it&#8217;s time to sleep. I use a white noise machine every night and it&#8217;s very helpful in hiding unwanted &#8220;outside&#8221; noise.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Conchobair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/conchobair</a> gives a detailed step-by-step plan on how to deal with </strong>inconsiderate <strong>neighbors.</strong></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>You can try talking to them. However, speaking from experience, I have found people who blast music in apartments are already inconsiderate people and this backfires as often as it works and it winds up turning into a ticky tack war between the two of you.</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>I&#8217;d skip #1 and go right to complaining to the landlord. Most places have some kind of noise policy. Contact management and see if they will help you.</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>If that is no good, call the police. Start off by calling the non-emergency number, but a lot of cities will have you call 911 anyways. Almost all cities have some kind of noise ordinance and they can be cited for the music or at least get a visit from the cops.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">u/justsayyesgoddess breaks down the woes of coliving in shared spaces and shares gentle advice to deal with the nuisance.</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Pretty sure this is just a side effect of living in shared spaces. Noisy upstairs neighbors have existed since we started living in top of each other.</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>I&#8217;d go and introduce myself and explain that I&#8217;m losing sleep, and ask if they could be more mindful in the future. If that doesn&#8217;t work, you can take it to your apartment complex and they can follow up/impose a fine if it&#8217;s appropriate to do so</em></p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Honey_Society/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/Honey_Society</a> has a solid plan on how to deal with noisy neighbors, based on previous coliving experience.</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Earplugs in the ears, beanie/headband over the earplugs and then sleep with a pillow over your head. If there are windows facing their direction hang some heavy curtains to help muffle the sound. Also, an ambient sound machine or your phone playing white noise. Our previous neighbors had dogs that barked through the night and the above steps helped us be able to sleep. You could also install flood lights on your side of the property that shine into/onto their property making outside a less pleasant place to sit.</em></p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RearNakedChoker/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/RearNakedChoker&#8217;s</a> Reddit story entails a perfect plan of action</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>For&nbsp;ongoing, constant&nbsp;noise issues : Check your cities noise ordinances. Google &#8220;noise ordinances + your city. Find the relevant ordinances that are being broken.</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Speak with the police regarding the relevant noise ordinances. Try them at lease 3 times before proceeding to #3.</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Sometimes the regular police suck at dealing with noise. Some major cities have specific units devoted to noise issues, in my city they&#8217;re called NET (noise enforcement team). If your regular cops aren&#8217;t cutting it, ask them if the have a NET, or an equivalent unit.</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>If all else fails, file a complaint with the Health Dept. I went the Health Dept. route before I found out about NET, and they were on the ball right away. Within 48 hours, all after-hours noises on my block were gone.</em></p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iliriel227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/iliriel227</a> adds a hint of revenge when coliving with noisy neighbors.</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The pandemic has got us all turning into couch potatoes. Quite literally, with our body&#8217;s newly acquired shape shifting capabilities as all the festive food goes in. And we&#8217;ve all been wanting to turn our lives around and finally start exercising, eating better, getting healthier and fitting into our old clothes again. But once you Google &#8216;health tips&#8217; and finally pick the ones that feel right for you, one thing or another gets in the way, making you go over this routine all over again day after day. So we&#8217;re here to help you kickstart your health and wellness regime. </p>



<p>Hopefully, this could be the last health tips blog post you will have to go through. Because this one will make you sing along to &#8216;I like to move it move it&#8217;, while you actually do move your bum.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best health and wellness tips curated just for you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Speaker_for_the_Sad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/Speaker_for_the_Sad</a> health tips involve making friends and roomis your workout partners to stay motivated</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Andefir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/Andefir</a> suggests taking baby steps when making a list of health tips to follow</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t do everything at once. Don&#8217;t try to go to them gym, eat healthy, no chocolate, no sodas, all at the same time. It&#8217;ll cause you to quit early on. Take small steps. If, for example, you want to cut out soda, try going every second day without it. Then try two days in row and so on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pot69/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/pot69</a> recommends a health tip we all could use when on a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/7-binge-worthy-netflix-shows-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix binge</a></h2>



<p>Instead of watching another episode, stretch for ten minutes, then watch another episode.</p>



<p>Now this is one of the health tips we like!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190810215543/https://www.reddit.com/user/thereson8or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">u/thereson8or</a> tells you to listen to what your body needs for health and wellness</h2>



<p>One of the most important health tips: Listen to your body! We are often in denial of the little voice telling us not to do something or that we crave something. If I have eaten shit for a while, my body almost screams for healthy alternatives&#8230;do it!!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kelbright/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/Kelbright</a> suggests making plans and goals that are sustainable over the long run</h2>



<p>When picking health tips to make your own, be sustainable. Don&#8217;t create this huge workout regime that you&#8217;re going to have to fight to complete regularly. Make a plan that your body and life can handle. Same thing for diets. Crash diets may help you lose weight quickly. But you&#8217;ll be miserable if you try to maintain them for any significant period of time. It&#8217;s better to create a balanced diet that you can enjoy with than to make yourself miserable in the name of health by cutting out enjoyable foods completely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RebelStarPilot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/RebelStarPilot</a> tells us to trick our brains into doing the healthy thing</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s all about tricking yourself into doing healthy things. For example, going to the gym. If you say &#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the gym when I have time/feel like it&#8221;, you probably won&#8217;t go. If you say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the gym everyday at 7pm&#8221;, even if you don&#8217;t go everyday, it is something that is scheduled and you have a higher chance of actually doing it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GIANT_CAPYBARA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/GIANTCAPYBARA</a> suggests maintaining a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/reddit-tips-for-when-you-cant-sleep-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy sleep cycle</a> as one of the most important health tips</h2>



<p>SLEEP.  Sleeping 8 hours a night is one of the most important health tips you can follow to maintain your mental and physical health. Bonus points if you can regulate your sleep time so you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Plus, who doesn&#8217;t like to sleep?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/righthandoftyr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/righthandoftyr</a> tells you to understand your primitive mind&#8217;s urges for choosing the right health tips</h2>



<p>Just remember that your body still thinks it&#8217;s a caveman. Your body will always be telling you &#8220;Eat all that sugary food while it&#8217;s here, and store up fat. You never know, you might need that fat if the antelope herds decide to move on to a different part of the valley for a while.&#8221; But we live in a world of reliable agriculture and food preservation now, there&#8217;s no need to store up fat to get through lean seasons that don&#8217;t happen anymore.</p>



<p>Similarly, your body is going to protest about working out. It&#8217;s going to want to conserve your energy and avoid the risk of hurting yourself because it still thinks that calories are precious things to be hoarded and even minor injuries could be a death sentence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In the end, it&#8217;s not just about willpower or self control</h3>



<p>People think it&#8217;s all just a matter of willpower to stick to a diet and exercise regimen. And that&#8217;s part of it, but a lot of it is just realizing that many of the urges you feel are obsolete mechanisms from a bygone age, and it&#8217;s okay to give yourself permission to ignore them. Half the battle is just learning to separate the real concerns from the anachronistic instincts leftover from our primitive past.
