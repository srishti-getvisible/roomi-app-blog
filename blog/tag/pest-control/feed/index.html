										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It seems the darn things can infect even the cleanest and most premium of places! There is just no way to be positive that a house will forever be free of bed bugs. The tenant will blame it on the landlord, and the landlord will blame it on the tenant, but the problem, of course, will persist. Whose job is it to get rid of the pests?</p>



<p>That’s why some <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-apartment-features-check-signing-lease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rental agreement leases</a> signed between tenants and landlords have an addendum (or an addition) called the Bed Bug Addendum. The Bed Bug Addendum is part of the pest control section of the lease that lays down both the landlord’s and the tenant’s rights and responsibilities should a bed bug infestation occur. This article covers the tenant’s rights and responsibilities.</p>



<p><em>Please note that the bed bug addendum is strictly followed as per law in only a few states. However, all major cities usually have equivalent addendums in their rental agreements where similar rules apply. Please check with your state laws before taking action.</em></p>



<p><strong>Bed bug addendum from the landlord’s standpoint, in a nutshell:</strong> The landlord has inspected and ensured that the house you’re renting is free of bed bugs. “And if you sign it, you officially acknowledge it.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the tenant’s responsibilities?</strong></h2>



<p>When you sign the bed bug addendum in your rental agreement, here are the responsibilities you’re agreeing to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ensure all the furnishings and personal items you’ll be moving into the house are free of bed bugs</li>



<li>Check for hitchhiking bed bugs after you have spent time elsewhere</li>



<li>Inform the landlord immediately if you do face bed bug issues</li>



<li>Cooperate with the landlord for all <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-diy-pest-control-measures-for-your-home-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pest control</a> efforts</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://cchealth.org/bedbugs/pdf/2016-Bedbug-lease-Addendum.pdf" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Here’s a form with detailed</a> responsibilities of residents, for example.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Things to remember</strong></h2>



<p>You are not required to sign the bed bug addendum unless you’re certain of the absence of the pests. <strong>The addendum comes with strict rules</strong>, including agreements regarding pest control fees, attorney fees, not holding the landlord responsible for an infestation, confirmation of personal property insurance, etc.</p>



<p>So<strong>, before you sign the rental agreement lease</strong>, ask if the apartment has had bedbug infestations in the past. If yes, note this in your lease’s inventory form for future reference. You can have the property inspected before moving in – exterminators and pest control experts do this. Additionally, the landlord can also have pest control experts to inspect your apartment once you start living there.</p>



<p><strong>Once you’ve become a resident</strong>, if you discover bedbugs in the apartment, write a signed and dated letter to your landlord; never let it be a verbal agreement. Send the letter through certified mail and request a return receipt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Help! There’s an infestation!</strong></h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Is it the landlord’s responsibility to get rid of the bedbugs?</h4>



<p>In most cases, the landlord is in charge of dealing with the pests, given that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You inform them in writing</li>



<li>You have been punctual with rent payment</li>



<li>You’re not the cause of the infestation</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Who pays for the extermination?</h3>



<p>This depends on who is guilty of the bed bug infestation. This is where the landlord may use the signed bed bug addendum against you claiming that there were no bugs before you moved in. If there’s no proof of who caused the infestation, you and your landlord can consider splitting the pest control fees.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-to-do-if-my-roommate-has-bed-bugs/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Related: What to Do If My Roommate Has Bed Bugs</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What if my landlord avoids the problem?</h3>



<p>Usually, your landlord has a week to respond to your written complaint. (Confirm with your state laws.) After the week is up, you can go to the court to force your landlord to hire exterminators, pay for your expenses, and offset your rent.</p>



<p><strong>Another point to remember:</strong> It is illegal for a landlord to retaliate with a resident who has filed a complaint or contacted the government or an NGO about a pest infestation. Your health and safety are more important and the landlord will face serious consequences if they take action against you.</p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strength-4-5"><strong>Strength:</strong> 4/5</h6>



<p>A true buzz kill for all the roaches chilling in your pantry and other areas of your home. For this, you will need baking soda and onions. Dice the onions, sprinkle with baking soda, and keep the smelly solution in the spots most frequented by the bugs.</p>

<p>Boric acid is a much less toxic way to fix your roach troubles than most bug sprays and insecticide options available in the market today. Most store-bought sprays are loaded with harmful chemicals that can linger in the air for very long. Boric acid is an extracted, processed, and refined form of Borax, found in various chemical products, and this hack combines Boric acid with peanut butter! <a href="https://cockroachfacts.com/boric-acid-and-peanut-butter-bait-for-roaches/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Get the hack here!</a></p>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strength-5-5-0">Strength: 5/5</h6>



<p>Diatomaceous earth(DE) is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock crumbled into a fine powder. It&#8217;s an all-natural substance that&#8217;s known for its powerful properties that help in pest control. A little DE dust can help with even the biggest roach infestations. For this hack, combine powdered sugar and <a href="http://npic.orst.edu/faq/de.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">food-grade DE dust</a> and spread this mixture in the hiding spots and surfaces where roaches love to hang out.</p>



<p><strong>Safety tip: DE may be natural, but even the food-grade variety can be harmful if inhaled. Keep it out of reach of pets and kids. Also, wear safety gear (<a href="https://droppe.com/products/category/c_gloves/c_single-use-gloves">nitrile gloves</a> and face mask) when using DE.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to reserve your conscience and not kill the bugs at all, you can. Here are some great natural &amp; homemade hacks to repel roaches and to keep them at bay.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t forget &#8211; you can avoid infestations by keeping your kitchen clean. Alternatively, if they keep crawling your way, you can try these roach traps and these amazing repelling hacks.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-out-of-roaches">6. Out of roaches</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s an awesome humane trap for our uninvited guests. For this hack, you&#8217;ll need a glass jar, bait, and petroleum jelly. Now place the bait at the bottom of the jar and rub some petroleum jelly inside the upper half section of the bottle. Place a straw/stick so the roaches can use it as a ramp to climb in. The star of this trap is petroleum jelly that stops the roaches from crawling out. Once all your guests are in the jar, you can take them to a park and release them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-cease-em-grease-em">7. Cease &#8217;em, grease &#8217;em</h3>



<p>A fragrant hack to keep those annoying cockroaches away. Essential oils like <a href="https://cockroachfacts.com/peppermint-oil-for-roaches/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">peppermint</a>, lemongrass, cypress, and even catnip oil are proven to repel roaches because of their powerful aroma. Dilute any of these oils in water and add to a spray bottle to use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-at-bay">8. At bay</h3>



<p>Another great home remedy to repel roaches is bay leaf. Just lay them out in your cabinets, closets, and kitchen area to keep them at bay <em>(literally!)</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi Tip:</strong> Roaches love water so make sure you keep your kitchen and bathroom dry. Making your home inaccessible to roaches is the single best remedy to infestations. Make sure you keep drains covered and any other holes and wall crevices blocked to avoid intrusion. Stay safe and roach-free!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s Halloween month, 2020! And unfortunately, because of the pandemic, the only trick or treaters that might pop up around your home would be the infamous Halloween celebrities: the creepy crawlies! So one dreaded but super important activity to keep the nightmares at bay: Pest Control! And if you&#8217;re looking for DIY pest control in NYC, you have landed on the right page. So read on. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s true that the creatures we consider to be pests aren&#8217;t all harmful. Some have even become pets over time! But it&#8217;s still justified for us to shudder at the sight of these creatures around our homes. They lurk in the dark. Live in dirty, smelly areas of our house. And most have multiple legs, which makes them the perfect horror movie material. </p>



<p>So it&#8217;s justified when even thinking about them might give some of us a sour face. And it&#8217;s no wonder we want these stubborn roomis to move out of our house, ASAP! So we have two options. We can either go for DIY pest control measures. Or choose the last resort of calling pest control in NYC.</p>



<p>As they say, prevention is better than cure. So here are some ways to prevent pests from making your home their own before you need help from pest control in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Pest control 101: It&#8217;s time to get clean</h2>



<p>If you have a bug problem, it&#8217;s time to get clean! Deep cleaning your house every month can help you avoid calling pest control in NYC. Creepy crawlies do come uninvited, but they mostly infest places they can feed in. If you keep your house a barren land for these little creatures, they might stay out of your hair for good. Clean all the nooks and crannies of your apartment with sanitizer and disinfectant. And try to make it a monthly regime to ensure rigid pest control at home.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Discontinue pest buffet services</h2>



<p>The place we want them the least is where they want to be the most. THE KITCHEN. So you need to make sure your kitchen doesn&#8217;t host charity meals for the pests lurking around your house. If you keep everything cluttered out on the countertops, the creepy crawlies will make your stuff their playground. And god knows where those legs have been! So start by decluttering your kitchen. Not only will it help with pest control, but it will also <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/9-space-saving-hacks-for-a-small-kitchen-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">save space in your kitchen</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Apart from decluttering, keep these DIY pest control measures in place</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keep your loose, open snack packs in containers and make sure all your storage containers are air tight.</li>



<li>Each time you or your roomis use the kitchen, wipe down the counters before and after use.</li>



<li>If you drop food on the floor, don&#8217;t put off cleaning it for tomorrow. Pick it up and throw it in the bin right away.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t leave food stuck on your utensils as they can attract ants and rats. Even if you don&#8217;t wash them right away, always keep them rinsed.</li>



<li>Always keep your sink empty and dry. A sink full of water is a pool party venue for cockroaches and mosquitoes. And you don&#8217;t want to be invited!</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with your kitchen, it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to practise these hygiene tips for your entire apartment for pest control. It doesn&#8217;t mean you have to get <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/dealing-with-a-roommates-obsessive-need-to-clean-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">obsessive about your cleaning routine</a>. But these simple cleaning practices can keep your apartment mouse and bug-free.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Say yes to doggy doors, no to crawly doors </h2>



<p>If you have <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/pets-with-roommates-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pet</a>, you might have installed a doggy door in your apartment for them to come in and go out as they please. But if you don&#8217;t consider the wall lizard or cockroach to be your pet, then you need to shut down those creepy crawly doors as a pest control measure. The common household pests usually like to take shelter in places we can&#8217;t see. Think patched walls or tiny cracks in your doors. So it&#8217;s time to crank up your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-simple-diy-repairs-for-your-home-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">DIY home repair skills</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Try natural pest control measures</h2>



<p>Using pesticides might feel like the most convenient way for pest control. But when you do use those, you might get a feeling they were designed to kill you too. So instead, maybe you could face your fear and see the common household pests in a new light. They&#8217;re just trying to survive this harsh world like the rest of us.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">If they pose harm to your health, call in the professionals</h3>



<p>If the pests that infest your home are poisonous and could pose health risks to you or your roomis, then it is justified to take harsher pest control measures to eradicate them. But if they&#8217;re relatively harmless and aren&#8217;t really bothering you, then you could try natural methods to drive them away instead of killing them. </p>



<p>After all, some <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoolBugFacts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">bugs are pretty cool</a>!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bed bugs are unspeakably gross.

As if the nasty little freeloaders weren’t durable enough, their shells are getting thicker. That reduces the effect of common insecticides, making them even tougher to evict from your apartment. Having them removed by the a professional pest control team in NYC</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">can cost</span><a href="https://www.angieslist.com/articles/how-much-does-bed-bug-extermination-cost.htm" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$500-$1500</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or more. Since exterminating them is such a giant pain, the ideal solution is not to come down with them in the first place. So here are some tips on how you can avoid letting the worst roommate ever into your home.</span> </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Educate </b>yourself about bed bugs in NYC</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn about</span><a href="https://www.orkin.com/other/bed-bugs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bed bugs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are 4-5mm long, or about the size of an apple seed. So they aren’t microscopic. You don’t have to bust out your high school pocket microscope to find them. They have only one item on the menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Blood. Yup. That’s it. Could these things possibly be any creepier? They can go for a year without eating. That . . . doesn’t even make sense, but there you have it. These bed bugs were made to survive NYC. These things are like aliens from another planet or something. They like mattresses, but not because they’re soft. They like dark crevices that offer lots of protection. Beds are a common party spot for them, but they can also be found gathering in other pieces of furniture, like chairs and tables. Or sheets. Even light sockets.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a</span><a href="https://bedbugtreatmentsite.com/bed-bug-misconceptions/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">common misconception</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that bed bugs only infest dirty places. It makes sense, at first glance. Dirty, polluted, filthy apartment? Please meet soulless, evil, insectoid avatar of corruption. With so much in common, the two of you will get along great!</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not so. Bed bugs will cheerfully inhabit perfectly clean places if they get the chance. One thing that keeping the place clean does do, however, is make them much easier to spot. Less cover for the little guys as they rush between the trenches. And bed bugs are easier to deal with if caught early. So while being clean won’t necessarily save you from them, it might save you a visit from an expensive NYC pest control team.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Craigslist is a haven for NYC bed bugs</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for once, nobody is talking about scammers. Bed bugs are notorious hitch-hikers. If you purchase a piece of furniture on Craigslist, and they are lurking within the depths of the poofy pillows, you can bring them into your home. Inspect thoroughly. Look for bugs, but also for eggs and skin shucked off when they molt. While not microscopic, it’s still tough to see, so bring a flashlight.</span> </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Creepers On the subway</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public transportation in New York can be a migration mecca for bed bugs. Taxi’s, shared bicycles, even ticket vending machines. The subway is a particularly popular scene for bed bugs in NYC. With so many people coming and going, it’s easy for them to move from one person to another. Or just hang out in the cushions for someone to sit down. In the past, whole New York</span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bed-bugs-found-on-the-nyc-subway-2014-8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">subway trains have been fumigated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after being overrun with the things. While avoiding the subway during peak hours is ideal, let’s face it, most of us have jobs and can’t afford to do that. So just be aware of where you stand, and it doesn’t hurt to check your clothes after you get home</span>.</p>
