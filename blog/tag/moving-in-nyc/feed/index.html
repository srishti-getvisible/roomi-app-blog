<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving in NYC isn&#8217;t the most exciting of tasks but certainly not as scary as some say. Here are a few myths related to moving apartments in NYC that hold little to no ground. </span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving In NYC Myth#1 All <b>Movers are shady</b></h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:92%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/jYmGmDK3rKdkk" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/jYmGmDK3rKdkk/giphy.gif"></iframe>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone has this idea about movers, cut-rate brutes who will chuck your belongings into a dirty truck, and hope that most of your things are merely scratched. They’d rather pressgang their friends into helping with the promise of pizza and beer at the end of back-breaking work.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this isn’t the case, and frankly, you get what you pay for. You’re more likely to damage your stuff with your buddies who don’t know what they’re doing, than if you get professional movers who have a vested interest and experience in moving people’s belongings in a timely and safe manner. Go to review sites, such as Yelp or The Better Business Bureau to find well reviewed movers and get your items to your new home securely.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth#2 <b>Moving apartments in NYC is stressful work</b> because of all the packing</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:100%">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Images fill the mind of people in back braces, lifting a person’s weight in books and furniture all day, only to do it all again when you get there. Playing real life Tetris trying to fit as most as possible into the truck so that you don’t have to make as many trips.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are simple tricks you can do to make moving in NYC easier. If you have containers, such as jars or empty vases, you can fill them with smaller things, so that you know where everything is. Everyone has a drawer of plastic cutlery and disposable plates, there’s no reason to bring those with you, use them up and start packing your silverware early. Anything you can do to incorporate packing into the normal activities of your life will help make it less stressful for you.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth#3 Moving to a new place <b>will bring new problems</b></h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:89%">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know your super or landlord, and presumably you have an alright relationship with them. Anything you need fixed or dealt with gets a speedy response, generally speaking. But you don’t know your new people from a hole in the wall, and what if they are more lackadaisical in their duties?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time, your problems are going to be small in nature, though the ego and stress can make it seem bigger. Get yourself a small tool kit and a how-to book of house repairs, and until you can see if your super is reliable, you can have the backup up of doing it yourself, and additionally, a little self-reliance is always a good thing</span>. Especially when moving in NYC!</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear not your shift from uptown to below 72nd. Myths are just that, you&#8217;ll make it just fine to your new stoop. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s. So. Hot.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your sweat hisses when it hits the sidewalk in the heat of the summer. Pigeons lay in the shade at the parks. You’re pretty sure you just saw a cockroach wearing a straw hat, sunglasses, and a Hawaiian t-shirt carrying a miniature suitcase down into the sewers.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, that last bit may have been a heat-induced hallucination. But then again, it’s <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-tips-on-how-to-save-money-while-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a>. Anything could happen.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">And the worst part of it all? You&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s this hot.</span> All the hot tips on the internet tell you moving in the summer is a <em>bad idea</em>. But here you are..</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s enough to make a perfectly grown adult throw a temper tantrum, but that would involve way too much flailing around for these kinds of conditions. It’s an especially bad idea if your apartment has hardwood floors instead of carpets.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here are a few tips from the </span><a href="https://roomiapp.com" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roomi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team to stay cool when you find yourself moving when it’s hot.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Timing is everything</b> when you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An old bit of advice that still holds true today. And probably forever. Schedule moving for early in the morning or late in the evening when the heat is at its least miserable. If you have a choice between the two, always do it early.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, getting up early is a giant pain in the butt. But moving day almost never goes as planned. If things go awry, but you got an early start, you’ll have more time to fix it. Also, the</span><a href="http://www.almanac.com/fact/what-is-the-hottest-time-of-dayr" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">hottest point in the day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is typically 3 pm, not noon. So you’ve got more cool hours to work with early in the morning that don’t involve stumbling around narrow metal staircases in the dark. Farmers get up at the crack of dawn for a good reason, as it turns out.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Hydrat</b>ion is key if you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot </h2>



<p>One of the best tips we can give you for moving in the heat of the summer  is this: <strong>hydration is extremely important</strong>. <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of different opinions on how much water you should drink in a day. There isn’t a hard and fast rule that everyone can agree on. But according to</span><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this popular article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the fluid intake for guys is about 3 liters per day and gals is around 2.2 liters per day. The word fluid didn’t slip in by accident. Lots of beverages contain water and can count towards your hydration efforts. But keep in mind that moving is tough, sweaty work and you’re doing it in conditions that would make a camel wince. So it’s a good idea to drink extra beverages if you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And by the way, slamming a six pack of Bud Light then wrestling a couch up a flight of stairs is so not a good idea. So don’t let anyone on your moving team get too crazy with their interpretation of “beverages.”</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Use utilities to your advantage.</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wherever you’re moving to, have the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommates-split-utilities/">utilities</a> turned on and ready to go before you get there. If you’ve got an AC at the new place, the apartment can be cool as you move in. You might be tempted to save some money and turn off the utilities at your current residence on move out day. Understandable. But if you can keep them going for one more day, you can run the AC at your place while you pack. Even if you don’t have AC, you can run fans. And more importantly, the fridge (you&#8217;re fridge will be your life saver if you&#8217;re moving when it&#8217;s hot). Which brings us to our final piece of advice.</span></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Cool, damp towels are your new best friend.</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cold, damp towel that’s been hanging out in the fridge can feel like pure ecstasy after a long day of moving when it&#8217;s hot. Maybe you can </span>even <span style="font-weight: 400;">stick it under a hat, so it covers your head and hangs down over the back of your neck through t</span>he day<span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don’t have power to the fridge, then cool water will still work wonders.</span></p>
