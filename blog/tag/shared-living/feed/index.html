<p>Moving out and living in an apartment can be a liberating experience. You&#8217;re finally out of your parents&#8217; hair, plus you get to stay in the city you&#8217;ve always dreamed about. But there&#8217;s a downside to your newfound freedom. And that&#8217;s using shared living spaces in the property. Part of the reality of being a renter is using a communal kitchen and sharing a bathroom.</p>



<p>Showering and grooming can be a hellish experience depending on your roomis. If you live with slobs, you&#8217;re probably all too familiar with the sight of hair stuck in the drain. Or that mildew building up on the shower curtains. If you&#8217;re the unhygienic roommate, it&#8217;s time to get your act together so you don&#8217;t gross your fellow renters out. Living in an apartment, after all, is all about respecting other people&#8217;s need for clean and safe spaces.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there are ways to make any shared bathroom a welcoming spot for everyone. Here are some handy hacks to get you started.</p>

<p>It can be chaotic when everyone&#8217;s scrambling to use the bathroom at the same time each day. When the entire apartment needs to get ready for work or school, your shower schedules are sure to clash.</p>



<p>This problem can easily be solved by coming up with a pre-agreed shower schedule. Set a time for every person to shower and apply a time limit, so no one hogs the bathroom.</p>



<p>When sharing a bathroom, it&#8217;s also important that everyone pitches in to keep it as spotless and germ-free as possible. This is where a cleaning schedule comes in. Take turns cleaning the bathroom at least once a week, using a checklist to make sure all surfaces are properly sanitized. Don&#8217;t skip the jobs everyone hates, here!</p>

<p></p>



<p>On top of the weekly cleaning schedule, it&#8217;s good manners to clean up after using the bathroom. With any shared living spaces, simple acts like wiping surfaces dry go a long way to keeping the area fresh. Store multipurpose spray or wipes under the cabinet, so no one has an excuse not to clean as they go! Some simple maintenance after you shower helps to keep mold and hard water build-up at bay.</p>



<p>Sharing a bathroom also means not leaving any traces of hair behind. For the gentlemen, try using a grooming mat to catch all your mustache and beard trimmings every time you shave. This is a non-slip material you place on top of the sink while you get rid of that five o&#8217;clock shadow. Just dust the hair into a trashcan and you&#8217;re done with cleanup.</p>

<p>Since you&#8217;re sharing a bathroom with roommates, you want to be extra mindful about how much time you spend there. It&#8217;s primarily meant, after all, for essentials like showering and doing your business on the toilet. Consider doing your grooming activities like styling your hair, putting on makeup, and checking out your outfit in your room. Invest in a vanity or full-length mirror so you can carry out your beauty routine there instead of in the shared bathroom.</p>

<p>Sharing a bathroom with roommates can get pretty messy, especially if everyone leaves their body washes, shampoo bottles and toothbrushes lying around. One trick is to buy a shower caddy &#8211; those plastic baskets that hold your stuff. Every time you shower, just bring it with your things inside so they don&#8217;t get mixed in with everyone else&#8217;s.</p>



<p>If the entire home has a caddy, simply hang them up with wall adhesives and label them with names. Now everyone has a place to store their shower essentials.</p>

<p>With shared living spaces, there&#8217;s a big chance that you and your roommates use a lot of the same products &#8211; from shaving gel to hairdryers. Make the most of the space under the sink to store these shared items and make them accessible.</p>



<p>You can find a lot of organizing bins and baskets on Amazon to store things like a pro. Label them with individual names or just write &#8220;everyone&#8221; on the items you&#8217;re happy to share. You can also hang hooks over the door for towels, so you don&#8217;t have to step over wet, dirty towels when sharing a bathroom.</p>

<p>When sharing a bathroom, no one wants to use one that smells disgusting. It&#8217;s particularly awkward and embarrassing if you leave it stinky and a roommate needs to use it right after you.</p>



<p>Scents can do a lot to make using the area more pleasant. Lighting a scented candle, using an aromatic diffuser, or just spritzing a room spray can instantly uplift the bathroom&#8217;s vibe. Try leaving a bag of potpourri to perfume the bathroom. Every time you do number two, you can also use poo sprays to mask those unwanted odors.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to keep sharing a bathroom with roommates that&#8217;s dirty, smelly, and cluttered. But at the end of the day, not everyone is a germophobe or a neat freak. While everyone can agree on rules and responsibilities, there&#8217;s always someone bound to mess up every now and then. Remember to take it easy and don&#8217;t get mad if someone forgets to leave out a fresh roll of toilet paper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 21st century has not only brought in changes in technology but also in social views and traditions. Gone are the days when couples would wait until marriage to cohabitate &#8211; now, it&#8217;s very common to see couple roommates living together long before that. Marvel fans will be familiar with the show WandaVision, which features the Avengers, Wanda and Vision, living together in a suburban area. Here&#8217;s what you can learn from them if you plan on living with your boyfriend/girlfriend soon. Be careful if you&#8217;ve not seen the show yet, though &#8211; this article contains spoilers!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do you know what you&#8217;re getting into?</h2>

<p>Living with your boyfriend/girlfriend is a big deal. There are a lot of things you need to talk about before making the decision to become couple roommates. There needs to be that assurance that both of you are on the same page with virtually everything. Living with another person, no matter how close you are to them, can create sticking points in your relationship. Because of this, it&#8217;s vital to make sure you both know each other&#8217;s boundaries. Ask the important questions regarding budgets and finances, chores, sharing, or whether it&#8217;s the right time. Though fans of the show WandaVision do not really know how Wanda and Vision got together, they must have had some serious talks about their future together offscreen if they decided it was time for them to get married.</p>

<p>Some people may be offended by this question. Of course, you feel strongly for your significant other, otherwise, you wouldn&#8217;t be dating them. But, before you consider living with your boyfriend/girlfriend, you need to be sure of where you both stand in the relationship. Do you both have the same plans for the future? Be clear about how you feel about each other before taking this big step. Wanda and Vision are one of the cutest examples of couple roommates ever. Their chemistry has always been electrifying, both in the comics and on the show. It was clear that they both knew where they stood from the beginning.</p>

<p>Most people don&#8217;t want to hear the word &#8216;children&#8217;, especially if they&#8217;re still dating. But, if you decide that you&#8217;re ready to start living with your girlfriend/boyfriend, then you may want to (gently!) broach the subject. You can&#8217;t decide for your partner and think they have the same goals as you do. Conversations such as, &#8216;do you want kids?&#8217;, or &#8216;how many kids are we talking about here?&#8217;, need to be had. Having children is a big responsibility in a relationship, and you may disagree on certain things if you don&#8217;t reach a consensus. For example, Wanda and Vision had problems figuring out the name for their baby (which turned out to be twins, but that&#8217;s beside the point!)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pets?</h3>

<p>Apart from dealing with the stress that comes with having children, if that&#8217;s what you decide you both want, you should also talk about pets if you plan on living with your girlfriend/boyfriend. Most children love pets, but they require a lot of care and attention. When Wanda and Vision&#8217;s twins initially asked for a dog, there was a bit of a problem because they didn&#8217;t know if they were ready for one. Do you or do you not want pets? The best thing to do is talk about it.</p>

<p>How do you deal with guests as couple roommates? Do you want to be able to entertain guests? What preparations will you both agree on for when a guest wants to sleepover? When living with your boyfriend/girlfriend, it&#8217;s expected that you&#8217;ll have guests, and you both need to prepare so that you aren&#8217;t stranded when a guest shows up unexpectedly &#8211; just like how Wanda&#8217;s brother, Pietro, shows up in WandaVision.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nosy neighbours</h3>

<p>You may have good neighbours, but there may also be one you can&#8217;t stand. Nobody likes nosy neighbours, but you can&#8217;t escape them. Sometimes, you may encounter a neighbour who wants to be in your business, the way Agatha was in WandaVision. As stated earlier, living with your boyfriend/girlfriend means setting effective boundaries, and you and your partner need to establish some for your potential neighbours.</p>



<p>So there you have it! Moving in with your partner is a big responsibility, but if you do things right, then you can be sure to avoid encountering problems in the future. Good luck!</p>

<p>It’s okay to feel confused on where to start when it comes to shared apartment hunting, especially in NYC. You have all these chaotic stream of questions like “<a href="https://www.instructables.com/Tips-for-Moving-in-New-York-City/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">where to begin</a>? how to find someone to share an apartment? how to be within budget?” and so on. Here, at Roomi, we hear you! So, here’s your go-to guide that answers all questions about a shared apartment, finding your perfect roommate and room share in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is an apartment share?</strong></h2>



<p>A shared apartment is defined as two or more people who live in one permanent rental housing unit. They all are responsible for sharing costs associated with maintaining housing such as rent and utilities. In simple terms, share houses are basically rental places with shared spaces separate from your private room.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why share an apartment?</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s face it, apartments and rooms are expensive in NYC! So, for most people, renting on your own is going to be exorbitant unless you&#8217;re earning megabucks. For many, living with roommates is the best alternative to living somewhere out in the suburbs.

<p>Besides, it’s a great way for gathering together to share and exchange in a new way of living, and make amazing friends along the way. Shared apartments have lower initial and monthly costs paralleled to regular rental apartments. This makes life more comfortable as one can live quite reasonably in them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is a shared apartment different from room share?</strong></h3>



<p>A room share is when two friends rent a room from an owner directly. This also is the situation where there are 4 roommates living in a <a href="https://theconversation.com/room-sharing-is-the-new-flat-sharing-84359" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">2-bedroom apartment</a>. This can ruin your privacy unless you’re accustomed to the habits of your roommate.</p>

<p>In the case of shared apartment, often a business manager leases the house by finding residents to oversee and supervise the property. The management, cleaning, and responding to residents&#8217; problems are all the responsibility of the management company so you can live comfortably.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">R<strong>oom/apartment share go easy on the wallet</strong></h3>



<p>One of the room share benefits is that, you&#8217;ll split the cost of the apartment with others. This will bring down the amount you spend on rent, leaving you with more dollars in your pocket to spend on actually living. Not only will your monthly outgoings be lower, but you&#8217;ll also have to worry less about a full security deposit. This would make it easier to secure a room than a shared apartment for rent. Utilities are generally inexpensive when you split the cost with roommates too.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>With shared apartment comes shared living</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re new to a city, living with roommates gives you an instant connection, plugging you into the life of the city. Even in situations when you don&#8217;t have an established network of friends to socialize, shared apartment culture is riveting. In cases where you&#8217;ve already got a social life, you rarely feel like coming home to a silent apartment.</p>

<p>So you’re stuck coliving in the pandemic with a roommate you don’t particularly like. You have likely arrived here looking for an exit strategy from your shared apartment. Maybe a search for new apartments with roommates has already begun. Or perhaps you are at your wits&#8217; end and are now looking to escape to the depths of the Amazon forest to hide from all your problems.</p>



<p>Before the pandemic that shook our lives up, coliving in shared apartments was the trend of the decade. <strong>According to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/63-percent-of-millennial-homebuyers-have-regrets-heres-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> by the Urban Institutes Housing Finance Policy Center, only 1 in every 3 millennials under 25 reported actually owning a home in 2018.</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse">This statistic is a drastic shift from previous generations, with the total percentage of homeowners close to 8-9% less overall. It indicated a shift in the way younger folks are housing themselves.</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-your-roommate-make-your-life-a-living-hell" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">How did your coliving roommate make your life a living hell?</a></h2>



<p>Even before the pandemic, millennials’ wallets had been shrinking. This prompted people to hunt for apartments with roommates that fit a budget as well as social needs.</p>



<p>When you consider large cities like New York, close to 40% of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/coronavirus-quarantine-relationships-conflict-roommate-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people live in shared apartments</a> with roommates. <strong>But what if your roommate is a demon who has made your shared apartment your own personal hell?</strong></p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>We have all been here before, pandemic or not. Uncomfortable situations with your roommate can vary all the way from messy shared living spaces, piles of dirty dishes, to even interpersonal conflict. Whatever the trouble, it can be hard to survive in shared living spaces if you don’t like the people you are cohabitating with.</p>



<p>Moving out is often an easy and clear option, but even that has gotten trickier with the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of us have lost employment or are generally struggling with finances, making our options limited.</p>



<p><strong>If you must live on (if only to avoid moving back home to your parents), read on for some quick survival tips to keep you afloat from insanity in your coliving space.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Avoid angrily calling out your coliving partner, even if you’re mentally writing their eulogy</h2>



<p>Did you know that the United States&#8217; military during <a href="https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/Article/643229/the-american-wolf-packs-a-case-study-in-wartime-adaptation/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">World War II</a> paired submarine teammates based on how well they could support each other psychologically? <strong>It’s because confined coliving is actually the ultimate test of compatibility.</strong></p>



<p>So imagine your shared apartment as the battleground and your roommate and yourself as the submarine mates. <strong>To make coliving easier, try to hold out on your anger over small issues that might come up. If something really ticks you off, imagine your words as a wartime headline in newspapers the next day.</strong></p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/JO8y56O9mTmeY" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/JO8y56O9mTmeY/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Do you want the news to read, “Roommate chews off coliving partner’s head because they forgot to replace the toilet paper roll?” If that&#8217;s not the case, hold off for a bit. Take a deep breath and address the issue when you feel calmer.</p>



<p>According to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-surviving-quarantine-without-killing-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Coleman</a>, a Social Psychologist at Columbia, <strong>we need three positive encounters to every stinging remark that we make to maintain peace between both parties</strong>. So if you let that snarky remark pass off, you may need three ways to make up for the negative energy. Also, negative encounters in shared living spaces are remembered much more deeply.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Bring out the chalk, and draw a boundary in your shared apartment!</h2>



<p>Boundaries are everything when coliving in apartments with roommates. These boundaries have been blurred even more due to the amount of unstructured time we spend in our shared apartments.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:75%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/1BGRdWpe1auzG63NeC" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/1BGRdWpe1auzG63NeC/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If both you and your roommate use the living room at the same time, clashes are possible. Maybe a high-powered pilates class doesn’t go well in the background while you’re trying to concentrate on a physics lecture.</p>



<p>When physical space is limited, create structured time within your shared living spaces. <strong>If you and your coliving partner both wish to use a shared space, creating equal time blocks for use can help add a sense of separation and relief.</strong></p>



<p>Vary where you and your roommate are during different points in the day to avoid any clashes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Bonding through activities in your apartments with roommates</h2>



<p>Okay, so we previously established that your roommate is the cousin of the Devil himself. If you think there is still room to make amends in this coliving partnership, try to do low-pressure activities together that you both can reap the benefits of together.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p><strong>Examples include doing puzzles, painting, or even something simple like cooking a meal together.</strong> The pandemic may have forced the two of you into a shared living space together, but there are plenty of indoor activities to indulge in to create positive memories.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Have a clear set of quarantine rules for shared living spaces</h2>



<p>Go back to the rulebook of coliving in shared apartments with roommates. A clear-cut and honest conversation about who does the chores, who gets the couch, and for how long always helps. Especially in the pandemic, you should have clear rules about who gets to come over into your shared living spaces.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>You can even get together and write out the rules on a whiteboard and have it displayed like a constitution of your shared apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Hide under the covers or behind a plant in your shared apartment</h2>



<p>When all else fails, hide under your covers if you absolutely wish to limit interaction with your coliving partner. You can simply act as if you’re asleep when you both are in the same shared living space in your home. Just pop on some earphones and breeze through TikTok videos to avoid social interaction altogether.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Seek legal support for help with the coliving struggle</h2>



<p>Sometimes we know when the final straw has dropped, and you cannot put up with your roommate&#8217;s antics anymore. On a more serious note, inappropriate behavior when coliving in a shared apartment is simply unacceptable.</p>

	</div>
	


<p>In the early throes of the pandemic, a friend of mine faced a similar unfavorable situation with their coliving partner. This roommate accused my friend of “being romantically interested” in his same-sex roommate, eventually getting him evicted. The situation turned serious- the landlord of the shared apartment refused to return the security deposit. This came as a shock to my friend, who was accused unfairly by his roommate.</p>



<p>He took the time to find out about his rights as a tenant and ultimately filed a legal complaint against the landlord in question. If you think you are in serious danger or trapped in an uncomfortable situation, there are resources that can help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It could be one of the best, or maybe, one of the worst life experiences to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deciding-between-living-alone-and-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">co live with a roommate</a>.</p>



<p>Keep your expectations low because your co living experience could go either way. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/annoying-habits-to-avoid-when-co-living-with-roomis-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Your roommate could either annoy the living wits out of you</a>. Or they could become your best buddies you&#8217;d never ever want to live without. Nonetheless, you&#8217;ll be learning how to co live with a complete stranger, every single day.</p>



<p>Whatever your roomi future may hold, a great way to kickstart a good relationship with your roommates is a warm and fuzzy welcome!</p>



<p>So whether you live alone, or already share an apartment with roommates, here&#8217;s how you can welcome a new roommate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Feed your roommate a delicious meal</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re moving houses, you could sometimes forget or be too busy to eat. And we all know what happens then. Cue <strong><em>hangry feelings!</em></strong></p>



<p>So the best way to extend a warm welcome to your roommate would be with warm delicious food! You could <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/lazy-roomi-cooking-9-recipes-for-slow-lazy-days-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">prepare a hearty meal for them</a>. Or you could recommend some of your favorite restaurants in the neighborhood and let them have their pick!</p>



<p>And it is probably the best way to break the ice too. Because we all know, the way to all our hearts is through our stomach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Take your roommate grocery shopping</h2>



<p>Nothing kickstarts sharing an apartment better than <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/8-secrets-to-spending-less-while-grocery-shopping-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">going grocery shopping</a> together.</p>



<p>And if your roommate is new to the neighborhood, they might need a guide!</p>



<p>So show your new roommate around the neighborhood, and take them to all your favorite shops. They would be ever thankful, and who knows you might bond over the essentials you like to shop for! And even the kind of munchies you love to take home.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Plan a movie night for your roommate!</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re not much of a socializer, but still want your new roommate to feel welcome, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/movie-marathon-ideas-for-cozy-winters-with-your-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">plan a movie night</a> for them!</p>



<p>Ask them what their go-to movie or series is, and watch with them. Even if you don&#8217;t enjoy what they like, you could pretend for a night so they can feel more comfortable sharing an apartment with you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. B*tch about everything under the apartment roof</h2>



<p>Give them the gossip on your landlord, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/co-living-101-how-to-deal-with-noisy-neighbors-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the noisy neighbors you co live with,</a> or the street dogs in the alley. Start talking about things that mildly annoy you about sharing an apartment.</p>



<p>Like they say, nothing forms a greater bond than hating on something together.</p>



<p>So if you find something they dislike with an equal intensity as you do, take some time to talk and laugh about those annoying things. And before you know it, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-best-board-games-to-play-with-your-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you&#8217;ll be bonding</a> like you&#8217;d never thought of!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Discuss house rules and living arrangements</h2>



<p>As they start to settle in, take some time out to discuss the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/healthy-living-for-you-and-your-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">house rules</a> and living arrangements so they&#8217;re on the clear. Taking suggestions for house rules would work as a bonus!</p>



<p>Ask them about where they lived before. Was there something that they wouldn&#8217;t want to deal with again? Or maybe something they absolutely loved in their previous co living arrangements?</p>



<p>Tell them about the existing house rules but also be open to new suggestions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Welcome your roommate with a sweet gestural gift</h2>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be something big, but <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/give-the-gift-of-a-smile-with-a-quarantine-care-package/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a welcome gift</a> would be a great gesture for your new roommate. A small throw pillow, a candle, incense, or even a pack of chips or cookies, or whatever you think they might appreciate.</p>



<p>The gesture will make them feel less awkward during those initial days sharing an apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Give your new roommate some much-needed alone time</h2>



<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">moving is stressful and tiresome</a>. So while you initiate activities to do together, be mindful of whether or not they would be up for it just yet.</p>



<p>And at the end of the day, just give them some alone time to figure stuff out. So they don&#8217;t feel overwhelmed, and can get some much-needed rest!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Although living with a roommate is awesome for the most part, shared living can be challenging sometimes. Initially, moving out of your parent&#8217;s home seems wonderful. Additionally, you romanticize being best buds with your new roomies, getting home at whatever time you like without having to sneak in, and having sleepovers with friends every weekend! The dream. Sure, it&#8217;s fun, but sooner rather than later&#8230; you start to notice your differences, and some annoying roommate habits. And you start wondering if living with roommates could get easier. But don&#8217;t worry. Here&#8217;s your roommate guide to all things annoying! Read on. </p>



<p>You and your roommates are different people (even if you get along with your roomi well otherwise!), and sometimes you find yourself noticing the annoying roommate habits. Most of all, you’re struggling not getting your own way around the house… we’ve all been there.</p>



<p>Naturally, your roomi shares your feelings. </p>



<p>While living with roommates is not always the best thing, and they might not be your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/making-perfectish-roommates-a-reality-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">soul-roommate</a>, learning how to navigate the great indoors with your current roommate will make both of your lives easier and more enjoyable!</p>



<p>Here’s the roommate guide to how exactly you can do that. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Accept the annoying roommate habits</h2>



<p>When it comes to doing things around the home, you like things to be a certain way. From keeping the kitchen sink empty at all times and rinsing the dishes right after eating, to keeping the cushions on the couch a certain way. And you and your roomi might not see eye to eye on these little things. Just remember, that’s okay! It can be turned from annoying roommate habits to just something that is a fact of life.</p>



<p>Ultimately, everyone’s different. So, our number one rule for happiness when it comes to shared living with roommates is to accept your differences and annoying roommate habits too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Talk about it</h2>



<p>Once you accept your differences when co-living, it&#8217;s key to remember that communication can go a long way.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re worried that their habit of leaving the sink overflowing with dirty dishes could bring mice in, let them know. It makes sense to talk to each other about annoying roommate habits instead of ignoring the elephant in the room.</p>



<p>Our roommate guide says, keeping things inside will make co-living tougher for you. If you&#8217;re having trouble confronting your roommate, you could always send a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/texts-resolve-common-roommate-conflicts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">text to resolve your conflicts.</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Compromise is key when it comes to annoying roommate habits</h2>



<p>If you find yourself singing &#8220;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/10-ways-to-let-go-of-the-need-to-control_b_7305102" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">I want it that way</a>&#8221; a little too often, ask yourself what&#8217;s really bothering you. Is it just that you didn&#8217;t get your own way, or is it something else?</p>



<p>If hygiene isn&#8217;t compromised and it&#8217;s simply a difference in opinions, try doing things their way once in a while. Who knows, you might find a new way to keep order in the house and like it too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Collaborate on the house rules</h2>



<p>No one likes a know it all &#8211; one of the most annoying roommate habits there is. And let&#8217;s face it &#8211; when someone tells you not to do something, you itch to do it even more! So, if you&#8217;re someone who wants things a certain way and wants to make rules about it, ask for your roomis input instead of just stating your rules.</p>



<p>If your roomi is a night owl and watches TV too loudly at night, but like Cinderella, you want to be off to dreamland by midnight, this is a clash of lifestyles that needs to be addressed. Just remember, this can be resolved without you going to sleep annoyed every night. Sit together and try to find the middle ground for a happy co-living experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. It works both ways</h2>



<p>You cannot expect your roomi to cooperate if you&#8217;re not willing to do the same. So instead of constantly wishing they&#8217;d be more co-operative, see where you can meet in the middle to cooperate and set an example for healthy shared living. In the long run, you&#8217;ll find that they&#8217;re more willing to do the same for you! And slowly, the annoying roommate habits will stop bothering you.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When finding a home to rent, with all the amenities that help you create an oasis for yourself, finding the perfect roommate often turns out to be the toughest task of them all. Shared living in and itself comes with its own set of challenges, often unanticipated, even if it&#8217;s your fourth or fifth time renting. The perfect roommate, or what we&#8217;re calling your soul-roommate, doesn&#8217;t have to a long-lost dream though.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/benefits-conveniences-roommate-finder-app/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Related: The Benefit And Conveniences Of A Roommate Finder App</a></p>



<p>Like every other relationship ever, it&#8217;s only obvious that deciding what we&#8217;re looking for in a roommate would be a learned-over-time kind of deal.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all about trial and error, y&#8217;know?</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

	</div>
	


<p>The top 10 attributes people look for in a roommate, based on a survey conducted in 2019 with over 6000 people, are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Respect</li><li>Responsibility</li><li>Honesty</li><li>Cleanliness</li><li>Friendly</li><li>Quiet</li><li>Non-Smoker (Help My <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-my-roommate-smokes-and-i-dont/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roommate Smokes</a> and I Don&#8217;t)</li><li>Age</li><li>Similar interests</li><li>Love for animals</li></ul>



<p>Other close contenders to this attribute-list of the perfect soul-roommate were gender, having furniture, an inclination towards cooking, similar dietary habits, and tastes in music.<br><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-real-roommate-problems-resolve/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Related: 5 Real Roommate Problems And How to Resolve Them</a></p>



<p>These are the most common attributes people generally look for when choosing the right roommate. Finding <em>your</em> &#8220;perfect&#8221; roommate, however, might take a little more effort on your part than initially anticipated.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/AF2BK0kTirsHsbLeqQ" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/AF2BK0kTirsHsbLeqQ/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>So here&#8217;s a walk-through on picking a soul-roommate that might just come close to perfect.</p>



<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: In a shared living situation, these qualities are equally applicable to yourself, the reader, too. This ecosystem exists on a very delicate line of stretched-out thread and you&#8217;re holding one end taut just like your roommate with the other end, capice?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does the word &#8216;soul-roommate&#8217; mean to you?</h2>



<p>We often carry with us the habits we form in our previous living situations to the new setting. The thing is, these habits might not always click with your new roommate. What might be a random bit you like indulging in, might just be a deal-breaker for the roommate you seek.</p>



<p>We advise creating an actual list of things you want from your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/ways-to-make-a-new-roommate-feel-welcome-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">new roommate</a>. Make this as personal as you can. If luck&#8217;s on your side, your roommate and you might just have multiple similar interests and needs. If that&#8217;s not the case, we recommend communicating your likes/dislikes clearly and being equally willing to accommodate their likes/dislikes too.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/wJOAGn2z78hDpHJxsM" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/wJOAGn2z78hDpHJxsM/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Flexibility and perfect roommates that go beyond yoga.</h2>



<p>Flexibility in shared living can be a little more complicated than fixing a yoga routine together. What you seek is bound to conflict with what your roommate(s) want at some point or the other. From a simple furniture addition to more serious issues like smoking and fights with their better-halves you wish you didn&#8217;t witness &#8211; especially the night before an important exam.</p>



<p>Soul roommate or not, we recommend getting this out of the way first. The best solution to creating certain boundaries is to get creative with it. </p>



<p>Get together and create a fun roommate agreement! A piece of paper where each party notes down their deal breakers, boundaries, and compromise points. Make this a sacred document, one that might also serve as a great centerpiece on your living room wall!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A table for two, please!</h2>



<p>A known trick to getting to know someone and see if you are a good match is to share a meal, in a public setting, with maybe a drink and a half. How people act in restaurants can be very insightful and often tell you things you might have otherwise failed to catch. Be on the lookout for those that seem too &#8220;good to be true&#8221; &#8211; chances are they probably are.</p>

<p>Inviting them to a casual hang/party with your mates might also be a good bet if the person&#8217;s already moved in. Your friends might help you understand them better while also giving them a chance to understand you and your circle. </p>



<p>Managing expectations with your soul-roommate? Check <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The mighty rule of &#8220;good enough&#8221;.</h2>



<p>Any relationship is bound to experience conflict. In a situation where disagreements arise between you and your roommate, it is important to know how your roommate responds to stress. This enables you to successfully resolve a conflict without any unnecessary damage.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-common-behaviors-passive-aggressive-roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Related: 5 Common Behaviors Of A Passive Aggressive Roommate</a></p>



<p>Instead of fighting over what you want vs what they want, try and find a middle-ground which is, yep you guessed it, <em>good enough</em> for both you and your roommate. All you need to have is an attitude that is willing to compromise. Be respectful if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re hoping to get in return.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Space, and stuff, y&#8217;know?</h2>



<p>One of the main challenges of shared living is setting boundaries. How do you make sure you&#8217;re respecting the other person&#8217;s personal space and boundaries and vice-versa?</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-expert-tips-co-living-introvert-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">4 Expert Tips For Co-Living With An Introvert Roommate</a></p>



<p>If it&#8217;s a material thing that you need and your roommate has it, it&#8217;s always best to ask. There&#8217;s nothing worse than accidentally breaking something of your roommate&#8217;s that you didn&#8217;t ask to use in the first place.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s personal space that you think might become an issue, since the space you share with the other person is quite tight, be a little more open about what you are feeling and encourage them to do the same. A good trick is to run over your day with them in casual conversation so they know what you&#8217;ll be up to and leave you alone when you need it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>When sharing a house in NYC, you need to know how to live in a shared house in NYC in the first place. Here's all that you need to know!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of renting an apartment, you may choose a shared house in NYC instead. In some ways, sharing a house in NYC is just like getting along with roommates in an apartment building. But in other, less obvious ways, it&#8217;s actually pretty different. Here’s some advice on how to live in a shared house in NYC so you can have a positive relationship with your roommates that is clean, healthy, and reasonably sane.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Home security</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&#8217;re sharing a house in NYC, you’ll need to approach home security a little differently. The apartment complex may have a main door to the entire building, and most of the apartments are above the ground floor. In a house, there are more points of accessible entry, and there is no backup plan like a secure apartment building entrance. Also, houses just look more tempting. In the mind of a potential thief, there’s a lower chance of being seen because there’s less people around and a better chance of finding valuable stuff.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to think of a burglar as someone who flits from shadow to shadow in the middle of a moonless night. But</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://simplisafe.com/blog/break-in-times" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">most robberies occur in the day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In summer. When it’s nice out. And you and your friends are off toiling away earning cash at your respective jobs. So it is ultra, super important that <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-to-set-in-apartments-for-rent-with-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">everyone you live with</a> understands the necessity of locking doors and windows</span> in your shared house in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>Careful what you say, the walls have ears </b>in your shared house in NYC</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’re out of an apartment building, you might think you won’t have to deal with neighbors waking you up. Or depending on your lifestyle, you don’t have to fret about waking up your neighbors. But keep in mind you’ll have a better chance of getting sound insulation between two apartments than between two rooms in a shared house in NYC. Walls separating apartments may have concrete or other sound dampening materials. In the house, it’s probably just drywall. If you share a house, you’ll have to be even more careful about noise, not less.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Clean up crew</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing a house in NYC typically means having more square footage than an apartment. Plus more communal living areas to share in a house in NYC. Bigger kitchens, bigger living rooms, scaled up entry ways. That’s enjoyable when you’re accustomed to living in an apartment that qualifies as a walk-in closet to your friend in the suburbs. But that also means more to surfaces to scrub. You’re going to need to bring your A game and use elbow grease by the bucketful. Get the cleaning duties listed on an easily visible whiteboard in a communal area like the kitchen.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it gets sketchy in there then pests will come to investigate all those alluring aromas. Pest control is expensive, and it is often a landlord’s responsibility to handle it.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">But not always. It’s easier to show that a tenant attracted the bugs in a house than in an apartment building. Nobody is going to be able to say “Oh, the guy in the apartment down the hall totally lured those here.” If somebody in your crew drops the ball, you could get stuck with the bill</span> in your shared house in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>Greater expectations</b> in your shared house in NYC</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of sharing a house in NYC are pretty cool, but the responsibilities are greater as well. Impress upon potential roommates before they move in that this will be a little different than living in an apartment. Security, cleaning, and noise considerations have to be made. Do yourself a favor and communicate clear expectations before anyone moves in. Work your expectations into the lease whenever possible.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you share a house? What do you do to keep a happy living arrangement? Post your comments below.</span></p>
