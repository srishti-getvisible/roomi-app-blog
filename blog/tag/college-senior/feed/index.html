<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Apply For internships</h3>



<p>Internships are a fantastic way to gain experience in the field that you’re interested in. College career services are often able to help students find and apply to internships. Make sure your resume is polished before applying to an internship.</p>



<p>Apply to as many internships as you can &#8211; there’s no such thing as too much experience. Internships also have the potential to lead to future employment!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Join clubs and other extracurriculars on campus</h3>



<p>Building your resume is about more than just work experience. Employers want to know about who you are as a person and what makes you special. Do you have a hobby or special interest? Join a club on campus! There are often numerous clubs available for students on college campuses.</p>



<p>Volunteering is also an awesome way to boost your resume and is a super important career tip on our list today. Find a cause that you’re passionate about and research volunteer opportunities near you. Many volunteer opportunities are now available online as well! </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Last career tip on our list &#8211; Do your research!</h3>



<p>It’s okay to not know what job you want after you graduate! Don’t stress; all college students are in the same boat.</p>



<p>Utilize as many resources as possible in order to obtain as much information as you can. Take career quizzes, research jobs, and talk to people related to the field you’re interested in. For example, want to work in marketing? Research online what kinds of jobs are available in marketing in order to see if one would be a good fit for you.</p>
