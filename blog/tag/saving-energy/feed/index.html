										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2018, the average monthly electricity consumption of a resident in the United States was <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">914 kWh</a>. Surprising, isn&#8217;t it? This consumption number led many to rethink their electricity usage and move to more sustainable ways of living. Fast forward to 2020, where we&#8217;re witnessing another shift from working in offices to working from home. The units consumed are steadily going up since we are spending more and more time at home, with some people even doubling their consumption. Today, the average monthly residential bill is <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$115.49.</a> Which means, we can all use some energy saving tips right about now. Because wouldn&#8217;t it be great to save on your utility bills?</p>



<p>So how can you reduce your utility bill while working from home? Read on to find out!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Manage the temperature</h2>



<p>This is one of the easiest energy saving tips. Because anyone that&#8217;s worked in an office knows it&#8217;s usually either freezing or way too hot. While working from home, your thermostat is in constant use and in your control. Regulating your home temp by a few degrees not only saves electricity but also money! Even one degree can save electricity. Small temperature changes are hardly noticeable but go a long way.</p>



<p>You could also install a programmable thermostat that automatically turns off or reduces heating and cooling when you are asleep or away. Did you know that you can save about $180 every year on average with a programmable thermostat?</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Replace your light bulbs</h2>



<p>Of course LED bulbs will come up on a list of energy saving tips. LED bulbs are very energy-efficient. You should replace them with the traditional incandescent light bulbs that consume excessive electricity. Energy-efficient bulbs (LEDs, CFLs, Halogens) are generally more expensive off the shelf. Still, they cost less in the long run and last longer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Purchase energy-efficient devices</h2>



<p>On average, home appliances roughly consume 13% of total household energy use. So, when purchasing energy-efficient appliances, you should look for devices with the ENERGY STAR label. This ensures that the device will consume less energy during usage and standby. Energy-efficient appliances might have higher upfront purchase prices, but their operating cost is often 9-25% lower than conventional models. Because these energy saving tips won&#8217;t be of much use if your appliances are obsolete.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. In the winter</h2>



<p>Insulation plays a crucial role in retaining heat during the winter. It also helps lower the overuse of electricity and reduces utility bills. If you want recommendations for your home, you can use the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/home-energy-audits/do-it-yourself-home-energy-audits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home Energy Saver tool</a>. The main areas for you to consider adding insulation are your attic, walls, floors, basement, and crawlspace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Install energy-efficient windows</h2>



<p>Windows add to about 10 – 25% of your total heating bill. So, changing to a double pane window helps break that loss. You can also use gas-filled windows with &#8220;low-E&#8221; coatings for homes in cold regions to significantly reduce your heating expenses. In warmer climates, you can reduce heat gain by lowering the amount of thermal energy that enters your home and reflect sunlight away from windows. Having Energy Star windows can save you $20-$95 each year on your utility bills, depending on where you live.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. The Eco Life</h2>



<p>Taking a mindful step towards saving the environment comes with taking small actions and turning them into regular habits.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>So, make it a point to switch the tube lights and fans off when you exit any room.</li><li>Remember to put your laptop on sleep mode when you step away for that second cup of coffee.</li><li>Unplug energy-hungry devices.</li><li>You should use the natural sunlight coming through windows and skylights instead of turning on lamps or lights.</li></ol>



<p>It&#8217;s time to stop asking how to save the environment and start taking action! You&#8217;ll end up saving money and are sure to reduce your utility bills significantly. So, use these energy saving tips starting today!</p>

<p>Your passports are renewed, you got the time off work approved, and your big roommate vacation is all set. Though you decided not to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-sublet-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sublet your apartment</a> while away, you’re still wary of the expenses you’re incurring. But there are also a few ways to save money, so you can spend the savings somewhere well-deserved. Here’s what you can do to minimize your utility expenses while away from home. We&#8217;ll tell you all about how to save energy and electricity for saving money.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Address your usage levels to save energy</h2>



<p>Long before you lived the fabulous life of roommates, your parents were constantly reminding you to turn the off the lights behind you to save electricity. At some point, you’ve heard the spiel about unplugging the TV or your cell phone charger when they’re not in use. But you’re probably thinking — how much is this <em>really</em> going to save, right? Writer and website publisher Michael Bluejay, also known as “<a href="http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mr. Electricity</a>“, says that obsessing over the small things is a waste of time and will ultimately cause you to miss the point.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Such trivia won’t make a dime’s worth of difference in your electric bill. It’s the bigger things that matter. With that in mind, you’ll first want to address the big energy users in your home first.”</p></blockquote>



<p>For the budget- and environmentally conscious roommates, Bluejay suggests focusing on the following when you’re away:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Save energy by regulating heating &amp; air conditioning</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/peteandpete-episode-5-the-adventures-of-pete-and-3owzWiFcL65UHlgmbe"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/3owzWiFcL65UHlgmbe/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="Episode 5 Specials GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="360" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>This one is pretty obvious but so easy to overlook when you’re preparing to go away. But if you’re not going to be home, there’s no need to run your heater or air conditioner all day even if you need them on for some of the time during an extended time away. You can find a happy medium, says Tom Price from Bostwick Energy Partners.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Setting a timer is the best solution for this. You only need to run your heat an hour during the day and an hour at night to keep your pipes from freezing.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In those hot summer months, monitoring your A/C is equally important to save electricity. Tom explains that maintaining a minimum of 68 degrees is your best bet to save energy costs.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Every degree below 68 uses an increasing amount of energy. If your home is insulated properly with a working A/C, 68° F will keep you cool,” Price adds.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Refrigerator</h3>

<p>The refrigerator is the second-largest user of electricity in most homes (13.7 percent), right after the air conditioner (14.1 percent), according to <a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The U.S. Energy Information Administration</a>. While some appliances we can use less to save energy and electricity, we don’t have that option here. (Especially when your roommate <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/healthy-living-for-you-and-your-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t even clean the fridge</a>.) </p>



<p>If you’re going away for just a few days, or even up to 10, it’s not worth unplugging your fridge or doing a mass cleanout. The savings won’t add up (and you might waste more throwing stuff away). But if you’re going to be away for a month or more, consider cleaning out and unplugging the fridge.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lighting</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/bulb-bulbs-tungsten-RK5LjrajNi6GknNuVA"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/RK5LjrajNi6GknNuVA/giphy.gif?resize=397%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bulb GIF by ewanjonesmorris - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="397" height="400" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Mr. Electricity stresses that you don’t need to worry yourself sick about&nbsp;wearing out your light faster just because you forget to turn them off here and there (although, there’s no reason to be reckless about it!). You can, however, replace older light bulbs with LED lights to save energy. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Washer/Dryer</h3>



<p><strong>Here’s a fun fact:</strong> Washing laundry in cold water versus warm or hot can help you save up to $152 a year, and that’s with no upfront cost. So if you’re one of the lucky ones with in-unit washer/dryer, this is a no-brainer to saving money (because you know that vacation laundry is no joke). And the&nbsp;efficient way to save energy on drying? Skip it all together whenever you can. Invest in a drying rack or simply hang up in your place to dry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/cbs-laundry-folding-3ohhwF1tZ7oKiYquGI"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/3ohhwF1tZ7oKiYquGI/giphy.gif?resize=500%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt=" - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="500" height="281" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Modern technology to save energy</h3>



<p>As technology continues to distract us from work and invite us to zone out during social settings, it’s still putting its fair share of good in the world and helping us to live better. Smart devices like the Nest Learning Thermostat 3rd Generation are perfect for renters and homeowners alike when away on vacation. </p>



<p>This device optimizes itself for unique preferences and schedules. Not only will it know what to do when you’re away, it saves an average of 10-12 percent on heating bills and 15 percent on cooling bills. This is great if you’re renting a place for a few years and want to invest. It’s also portable to your next rental.</p>
