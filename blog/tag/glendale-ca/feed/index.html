<p>Built in 1926 for James Derby and his family by Lloyd Wright, the Derby House is an awe-inspiring architectural wonder. Created from concrete textile blocks, wood and stucco, the plant-like patterns in the concrete blocks have been called one of Wright&#8217;s &#8216;strongest achievements&#8217; by UCLA historian Thomas Hines. So, whether you&#8217;re just visiting or you&#8217;re finding rooms for rent in Glendale, CA, this is a must visit!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rockhaven-sanitarium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockhaven Sanitarium Historic District</a></h3>



<p>Founded in 1923 by psychiatric nurse Agnes Richards, Rockhaven Sanitarium was the first mental asylum that wanted to provide better care to patients back in the day. It all started with one little rock house, which gives it its name, and was America&#8217;s first woman-founded mental health facility.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/schaffer-house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schaffer House</a></h3>



<p>John Lautner designed and built the Schaffer House in 1949. The main attraction of the house remains how it was planned around the oak trees and sits nestled neatly between them. Made of redwood and glass, supported by brick and concrete, it looks beautiful and includes nature in its architecture in a wonderful way.</p>
