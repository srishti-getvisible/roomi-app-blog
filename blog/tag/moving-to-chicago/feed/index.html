<p>Moving to a new city is always exciting, but especially so if it’s Chicago. The culture, the history, the food, the sports- everything about the city is exhilarating! But of course, moving out of your comfort zone and into Chicago is a big decision. One that you shouldn’t take lightly. Like any other major city in the world, the city has its advantages and disadvantages. You need to do your research before deciding on anything. Which is where we come in to help. Roomi has got all the info you need to know before moving to Chicago. So, read on and decide for yourself if <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/things-to-know-when-moving-to-chicago-roomi/">moving</a> to Chicago is the right choice for you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you’re moving to Chicago, be prepared for the cold</h2>



<p>Well, it’s called the Windy City for a <a href="https://www.history.com/news/why-is-chicago-called-the-windy-city" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reason</a>. The winters in the city can be brutal. So, if you’re thinking of moving to a new city for its cozy weather, Chicago might not be for you. Even by Midwestern standards, Chicago is cold. Because it’s not just the sub-zero temperature that makes it bad, it’s the wind on top of the temperature that will get to you. It might feel like days go by before you even see the sun. We don’t want to ruin the city for you, we just want to make sure you’re prepared for the reality. But if you’re someone who likes cozying up under a blanket and staying indoors, Chicago winters will be great for you! Not to mention, the summers in the city are delightful! It makes the brutal winter months completely worth-it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You don’t need a car if you’re moving to Chicago</h2>



<p>Oh yes, Chicago is a walking city! So, if you’re from <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-save-money-while-living-in-midtown-east-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York</a> (or any of these other 8 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/redfin-ranks-the-most-walkable-us-cities-of-2020-301001267.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cities</a>), moving here will be a cake walk (<em>get it?</em>) for you. Not to mention, the <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">CTA</a> is extremely convenient and affordable. Honestly, the only time you really need a car is when you’re trying to drive out of the city on a trip. And even then, be prepared for a stressful drive, the traffic is not fun. So, if you want to move to a new city with a great public transit system, Chicago is the place to be!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should you rent or buy if you’re moving to Chicago</h2>



<p>If you know anything about Chicago <a href="https://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/taxes-make-chicago-real-estate-hard-to-sell/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">real estate</a>, then you know how crazy it is out there. Which makes the city much better for renters. Not to mention, this way you can even get a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate</a> to cover half the expenses. Plus, you might want to get the feel of the city, before you decide to buy property there.</p>



<p>But even if you were looking to buy your first house, Chicago is a great city to invest in. In fact, if you’re looking for a fixer-upper, Chicago has the second most starter homes in the country. So, if you’re thinking of moving to a new city, Chicago has some great options for you, whether you’re a renter and buyer!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nothing like a Chicago beach</h2>



<p>You might not think of Chicago as a beach city, but you’d be wrong! There’s some amazing lakes in the city that you just cannot miss. There’s about 26 miles of coast along Lake Michigan and it is gorgeous. We recommend spending all your free time during the summers at one of these Chicago beaches. It’ll make you forget all about the horrors that are about to come with winters.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some beaches you have to go to:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Montrose Beach.</strong> This is the only dog-friendly beach in the city. But that’s not all. You can go kayaking, rent a cabana or just hang out on <a href="https://www.chicagoharbors.info/harbors/montrose/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Montrose Beach</a>!</li><li><strong>31st Street Beach:</strong> A very popular destination, <strong><a href="https://www.chicagoharbors.info/harbors/31st-street/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">31st Street beach</a></strong> is completely free of charge with some very fun outdoor activities available. Don’t miss it!</li><li><strong>North Avenue Beach: If you’re in Chicago, you have to go to North Avenue Beach, it’s a must. With <a href="https://www.castawayschicago.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Castaways</a></strong> at a walking distance, this beach is an iconic Chicago destination that has a lot to offer!</li></ul>

<p>Chicago is a city with a lot of different influences. So, it’s no surprise that the different neighborhoods in the city each have their own distinct personality. And if you’re moving to Chicago, you need to know about each of them, before you decide where you’re going to stay. Because, as you’ll find out, Chicagoans stay loyal to their neighborhoods!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>North Chicago</strong>: So here’s where all the young folks are at. You can find some amazing Jazz clubs walking around, or go Boutique shopping or simply catch a game. It&#8217;s a great place for youngsters to socialize!</li><li><strong>South Chicago</strong>: It’s one of the most <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-tips-for-living-with-an-international-roommate/">diverse</a> parts of Chicago. From the Museum Campus to Chinatown, this is an eclectic part of town!</li><li><strong>West Chicago</strong>: West Chicago is gorgeous. There’s beautiful churches, monuments and murals. Take all your instagram pictures here!</li><li><strong>Downtown Chicago</strong>: This is the tourist part of town. Of course, check it out when you’re just moving to Chicago, you need to do the New city stuff. But we reckon you won’t be hanging out here much after that.</li></ul>

<p>Ultimately, moving to a new city is a complicated decision, even if the city is as charming as Chicago. But if you do decide to move out of your current city and into Chicago, we’re so sure you’ll love it!</p>

<p>From humble beginnings to now flourishing as the third-largest city in the United States, Chicago definitely isn&#8217;t short of things to offer and amaze us.</p>



<p>If you appreciate architecture, Chicago will inspire you. If you love nature, you will feel right at home! Especially, with gems like the 18.5-mile-long lakefront trail and the 600 parks that Chicago has.</p>

<p>Here are some of our must-knows for anyone that&#8217;s contemplating, or actually moving to Chicago!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Travel anywhere in the city — on time — for $3!</h2>



<p>Unlike New York and LA, Chicago has no nightmarish commutes on its trains and busses. The subway here is called the L, a name humbly given to describe the elevated tracks Chicago&#8217;s trains run on. All L trains can be found stopping downtown in the Loop, where a major chunk of the population works.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.transitchicago.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Chicago Transit Authority</a>, or the CTA, has a total of eight train lines and 140 bus routes that run often on a schedule. It&#8217;s pretty affordable, too; a single pass will cost you $2.50, and a transfer to another train line or bus is just a quarter more.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:46%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/SiEKH5WaRRux5Tq7qQ" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/SiEKH5WaRRux5Tq7qQ/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Don&#8217;t be surprised if you ever find yourself wishing for a delay. Why? because about 70% of <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">train stations having significant architecture and art installations</a>. And, the ride is just as nice! Some might say even better! Running above ground, the trains will take you on backyard visits of chicken coops. And juxtapose it with views of the LaSalle Street Bridge as you find yourself crossing the Chicago River!</p>



<p>Want to see more of this city within the comfort of your home? <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/movies-that-capture-chicago-perfectly-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here are our favorite movies that capture Chicago perfectly!</a></p>



<p>Long story short, the transit is quite reliable. However, if you&#8217;re traveling from one end of the city to another, we wouldn&#8217;t recommend traveling on the L every day, as there aren&#8217;t enough lines running from the east of the city to the west. This is also a complaint most Chicagoans have, considering the several changes required to travel between the east and the west parts of the city. Another downer is that the Red Line ends at the 95th street, meaning it fails to reach neighborhoods on the Far South Side.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Midwest niceness will surpise you</h2>



<p>Remember those clubs in school that wouldn&#8217;t just send out flyers, but personally&nbsp;<em>insist</em>&nbsp;you join them? That&#8217;s somewhat similar to what moving to the Midwest is like. If you find yourself lost and Google Maps just won&#8217;t come through, don&#8217;t be shy to ask for directions — be assured you will be given a thorough answer without ever being made to feel like you have annoyed the person you asked. You will never find any pushing and shoving in crowded areas.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:49%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3fipSJ1ZqJXSA2jted" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3fipSJ1ZqJXSA2jted/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Don&#8217;t be surprised if you run into the morning conductor if you take the L for long enough. They don&#8217;t just announce the day&#8217;s forecast, but also sings his good morning! The camaraderie in Chicago is just as real Midwest niceness. And they successfully add to those things that make your day better, even if you&#8217;re not searching for them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The diversity in Chicago is truly charming</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re still surprised to learn that Chicago is about as diverse as a city can get, you&#8217;re probably <em>just</em> hearing of the city. Chicago&#8217;s communities and neighborhoods are tightly knit together in their representation of the city. They have, by default, built what Chicago is — and this is a treat, for anyone who is newly moving to Chicago and fears not feeling at home.</p>



<p>There are<a href="https://urbanmatter.com/chicago/mexican-restaurants-pilsen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Pilsen&#8217;s Mexican </a>restaurants and the murals. There are multiple art programs at the Indian American Center. Some breathtaking Polish-style cathedrals. The Stony Island Arts Bank’s archive of black history and culture and records in South Shore. Vietnamese noodle shops on Argyle Street. And Indian and Pakistani restaurants on Devon Avenue!</p>

<p>Moving to Chicago can also come with a free history lesson or two if you&#8217;re interested! There are 40 cultural heritage museums, and there are plenty of city organizations that host regular film screenings, art shows, and historical exhibitions about the city, as well as the multiple cultures that built it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you like walking, you will love Chicago!</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re one of those people who doesn&#8217;t mind a few walks in the day and the kind that would prefer walking over most mediums of travel whenever possible, you will most definitely love Chicago. It really is a walker&#8217;s paradise! Moving to Chicago does come with several perks, and its flat terrain and pristine sidewalks are by far some of our highlights of the area. But a close second is the easy to navigate street grid that makes exploring Chicago quite simple.</p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse"><em><strong>WALKER'S PRO TIP:</strong>&nbsp;The intersection of Madison Street and State Street is called "zero, zero" and everything else is calculated based on that. All addresses towards the east or west of the State are named accordingly, and similarly, all addressed to the north or south of Maddison are labeled if they fall south or north. The numbers increase depending on their distance from "zero, zero" — and are about 8 blocks to a mile — which means, something in the 800 block is likely to be a mile way!</em></pre>



<p>We definitely recommend being prepared for the initial overwhelm of moving to a new city. Especially if you&#8217;re <em>just</em> moving to Chicago. It&#8217;s a big city, with a lot to offer and it&#8217;ll most definitely take you by surprise — when you least expect it!</p>
