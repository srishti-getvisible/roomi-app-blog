										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>College exposed you to bits of the adult world – it taught you to live by yourself, find your own way, made you independent, and gave you the experience of jobs. As a college graduate, you’re doing great so far. But bear in mind that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/life-side-college-vs-post-grad-roommates/" target="_blank">adulting has more challenges</a> in store for you, like saving money.</p>



<p><strong>Related:<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-ways-to-save-money-and-make-money-in-college-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 7 Ways to Save Money and Make Money in College</a></strong></p>



<p>You’ll move out of your campus housing and find your own place; you won’t have a cafeteria but maybe a kitchen, and you’ll be traveling about a lot more.</p>



<p>The sooner you have a grasp on your financial situation, the better. It can be overwhelming, but don’t stress! We’re here to help you figure out the basics with these financial tips.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Open a savings account</h2>



<p>You may not have a lot right now, but opening a savings account is the first step. Keep your money in the bank and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.hellolatch.com/us/cyber/quick-safety-tips-for-online-banking-for-beginners-latch/149/" target="_blank">do the transactions</a> through there. Take a day or two to understand <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/savings-accounts" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">which savings account works best</a> for you and your career plans. The saved money in this account will serve you during emergencies, sometimes return interests, and make you feel more confident in your ability to save.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Review your budget</h2>



<p>Now that you’re taking care of your own finances, understand where your money is coming from and where it’s going. The next step is to draw a budget plan. Your budget plan should include a list of all your major expenditure, and how much of your money goes into each one monthly:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-november-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rent</a> and utilities</li><li>Food</li><li>Student loans</li><li>Transportation</li><li>Savings</li><li>Wardrobe, entertainment, miscellaneous</li></ul>



<p>Calculate the approximate amount of money you must set aside for these purposes. Now, if there are any leftovers, it goes into the savings or debt repayment. Install <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/best-money-saving-apps" target="_blank">apps that help you save money</a> and give you financial tips. At first, it’s not going to be easy at first. But as you get better jobs and get the hang of managing money, your budget plan will start looking better.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Make a student loan payoff plan</h2>



<p>Is the adulting college graduate in you ready for this? Student debt: The biggest challenge in the lives of Millennials and Gen Z. The sooner you clear your debts, the more you will save money on interests. The first steps to take:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Fix the budget</li><li>Set a goal</li><li>Consider your payment options (below)</li></ul>



<p>Consider switching payment methods for federal loans – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans" target="_blank">here are the different repayment plans by the government</a>. See if you <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/what-is-loan-forbearance-deferment" target="_blank">qualify for deferment</a> of your student loan, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/lower-payments/get-temporary-relief/forbearance" target="_blank">for forbearance</a> based on your financial situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Review your credit report and scores</h2>



<p>Get a credit card as it helps you build a positive credit history; it also comes with benefits and rewards. A card helps <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-build-credit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build your credit score</a>. The most important financial tip here is to use your credit card responsibly and make payments on time.</p>



<p>Your credit report holds details of your credit use and history. Your credit score is a score that depends on your credit report details. These are important in making long-term decisions like refinancing student loans, getting a mortgage, buying a car, etc. Check your credit report <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Prioritize your spending</h2>



<p>Your highest priority while saving money:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Pay off debts &gt; Emergency fund &gt; Everything else</p></blockquote>



<p>On a smaller scale, keep going back to your budget plan to remind yourself of the priorities. We’re not saying don’t have fun with friends at all, but consider what kind of fun you can afford to have as a fresh college graduate. There will be times when you come into more money than other months – resist the urge to splurge.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some everyday financial tips to save money</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The moment you’re out of the house and step out by yourself, the real world suddenly throws a collection of challenges at you. Your first and foremost responsibility is to get some financial stability.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a fresh college graduate with a student loan to pay off, or just plain broke and by yourself in a big city, a sense of financial steadiness will give you the confidence you need.</p>



<p>Here are some money saving tips to help you get on your own feet.</p>



<p><strong>You may also be interested in: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-ways-to-ask-parents-for-money-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Ask Your Parents For Money If You Really Need Some</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Make a budget</h2>



<p>Grandpa was right: make a budget, draw a line, be frugal. Stick to this mantra when money is tight, especially as a young adult. When you make a budget based on your needs, you have a clear knowledge of where your money is going every month. Follow this <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/the-importance-of-personal-finance-management-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial management</a> tip and, within a couple of months, you’ll have your budget Excel sheet perfected as you change your expenditure practices to suit your income.</p>



<p><strong>Side note: Learn self-control. This is a good time to consciously remind yourself often to not be frivolous.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Save a fraction of your income</h2>



<p>Set a fraction of your income aside after every payment, however small. This should be accounted for in your budget. As this amount you start as a young adult adds up in time, you’ll have a stable and growing reserve of saved money for your future, and you can dip into it during emergencies. A good amount would be one-third of your income, but, really, whatever floats your boat!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Start an emergency fund</h2>



<p>A better idea than dipping into your savings during emergencies is to start an emergency fund for yourself. “Pay yourself first!” It’s true that you have a student loan, or a credit card debt, but remember that YOU are important too. You can sleep peacefully at night knowing you have something financially to fall back on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Be careful with credit cards</h2>



<p>Credit cards give a false sense of financial empowerment that&#8217;s easy to fall for. Watch out! They wouldn’t have made it that easy if they didn’t have something to gain with your spending. Credit cards target young adults, especially with tempting offers. Use your card for purchases that can be paid off within a month. <a href="https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/help/7-things-to-know-about-credit-cards-6000/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn the basics of how credit cards work</a>, and be mindful of your credit report.</p>



<p>Do NOT carry balances forward – they will only lead to interests and late fees.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Learn to cook</h2>



<p>This may seem like an odd suggestion among financial tips. But, until you live alone and are solely responsible for your meals, you won’t understand just how much food costs. Getting a takeout every time or ordering something in will drain your finances quickly. Instead, learn to cook for yourself; the ingredients are super inexpensive if you know where to go in your locality.</p>



<p>This is healthier, too, and you’ll be saving on long-term medical bills in the future!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Hang out with friends at home</h2>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/fun-ideas-for-a-night-in-with-your-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There’s plenty to do at home</a>! Instead of going to the movies or hitting the bar with your friends often, find things to do at each other’s houses. This is a great way for all of you to save money while also spending quality time together. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/top-7-movies-to-watch-on-netflix-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Find a good movie on Netflix</a> or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-best-board-games-to-play-with-your-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start a new tradition like Game Nights where you explore new games</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Pay your bills</h2>



<p>We know all too well about that pinch you feel when you need to fork out for bills and rent, especially when you’re just a recent college graduate trying to get by. Just hold your breath and get it over with at once, because the longer you wait, the more expensive it can become!</p>



<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Ignore the financial trends. At least for the time being! Now is your time to save the seemingly measly money you’re earning. Do not listen to financial cable channels’ “advice for young adults!”</p>

<p>There’s no place quite like The Big Apple! New York City is the perfect spot for young people to live during their 20s and 30s. There’s plenty of job opportunities and countless activities to do to keep you occupied on the weekends. NYC is truly the city that never sleeps!</p>



<p>However, since there’s always something to do in NYC, it can be hard to refrain from spending money on cute clothes or fun outings with friends. It can be tempting to go out to drinks with coworkers after a long work week, even though your budget may not allow it. Since it can be hard to save money when you’re living in such an exciting place, here are a few tips and tricks on how to save a few bucks if you’re living in the neighborhood of Midtown East.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get a roommate!</h2>



<p>Finding a roomi is a fantastic way to save money as a young person <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/7-things-check-find-roommate-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living in Midtown East, or anywhere in NYC for that matter!</a> Sharing space with a roommate will not only help with the cost of living (which can be pricey in Midtown), but it will also help you to get to know others if you’re new to The City. Who knows, you and your new roomi might even become BFFs!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Skip the taxi ride</h2>



<p>If you have a long walk to and from work, it can be tempting to splurge on a taxi. Unless you’re running late and it’s absolutely necessary, try walking instead. Not only will walking save you a significant amount of money, it’s also free!</p>



<p>In addition to walking, it’s a good idea to not have your own car in the city if you’re trying to watch your spending. Cost for long-term parking in the city can be expensive, so it’s best to not have your own wheels if you’re looking to save money. Plus, everything essential is at a walkable distance in the city, so there’s really no need for your own car.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cook at home</h2>



<p>With delivery apps at the tip of your fingers, it can be tempting to order from restaurants multiple nights of the week. However, ordering takeout and visiting restaurants (especially in Midtown), can rack up an expensive bill.</p>



<p>Instead of eating out, plan out your week accordingly and cook at home. To make mealtime even easier, meal prep your meals so you have dinner ahead of time in case you had a long day at work.</p>



<p>In addition, if you go to work in-person, make sure to pack your own lunch. Not only will you save time waiting to get your food delivered, but you’ll also save money. Your bank account will thank you later!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Work out at home instead of the gym</h2>



<p>Another sneaky way that our bank accounts get drained is through monthly gym fees. Although it’s great to have a gym to work out at, it may not be the most practical purchase if you’re a young person looking to save money. Gyms can be costly, especially in NYC. Plus, in the era of COVID-19, going to the gym may not be the safest option.</p>



<p>Instead of working out at a gym, create your own at-home workout space in order to save money. Invest in a few pieces of gym equipment and Google your favorite workout routines in order to create your own personal gym. Better yet, go outside for a run!</p>

<p>Thanksgiving is quickly approaching, it&#8217;s now less than a week away! <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/delicious-thanksgiving-dinner-ideas-to-beat-2020-blues-veggie-vegan-options-included/2407/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Between cooking and preparing your home for Thanksgiving festivities,</a> it can be overwhelming to think about the upcoming Christmas season. And it can be a lot more stressful if we add financial goals to the picture. If you&#8217;re looking to save money on Cyber Monday,  it might be a good idea to start planning Christmas shopping now. Doing so will also allow you enough time to gather the presents that you need. Cyber Monday shopping is also much less stressful than waiting until the last minute to shop!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/sale-cyber-monday-DLYkdo32gZgIE1hOAP"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/DLYkdo32gZgIE1hOAP/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="Shopping Shop GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="360" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Black Friday is an extremely popular day to shop online, which is why many people choose to wait the weekend out and shop on Cyber Monday instead.</p>



<p>Here are a few tips and tricks that&#8217;ll help you with your Cyber Monday shopping &#8211; and save your dollars in the long run.</p>



<p>Happy holiday shopping!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Make a plan</h2>



<p>Don’t shop without a plan! Make a list of every person you need to buy a gift for and what you would like to get them as a present. Next, make sure that you know <em>where</em> you’re going to buy the gift so you’re not struggling to find it in stock last minute. Making a plan for your shopping steers you away from making impulsive purchases that you’ll regret later. Emotional buying is a very real thing!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Make a realistic budget</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/tips-to-manage-your-finances-without-stressing-out-roomi/1749/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christmas shopping can be expensive, so it’s crucial that you make a spending limit for yourself so you don’t overspend.</a> With numerous sales and deals on Cyber Monday, it can be tempting to buy items that you don’t really need.</p>



<p>Make a separate budget for gifts for friends and family and another budget if you’re planning on buying gifts for yourself. Don’t forget to treat yourself this holiday season!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Compare prices between multiple websites</h2>



<p>Make sure you’re getting the best deal this Cyber Monday! If you have your heart set on a certain gift, make sure you do your research and compare prices offered by different websites. You may end up saving a significant amount of money! Research any available promotional codes or coupons to see if you can save more money with your purchase.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/ebatescanada-black-friday-online-shopping-3o6fJ9n1yqbSRehFni"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/3o6fJ9n1yqbSRehFni/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="Black Friday Online Shopping GIF by ebatescanada - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="480" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Have a back-up plan, especially if your goal is to save money on Cyber Monday deals.</h2>



<p>Plan ahead in case an item sells out on Cyber Monday! Make a back-up plan for each gift so you know what to do if your purchase sells out. Since so many people shop online on Cyber Monday, inventory selling out is a definite possibility.</p>



<p>Look at your gift list and add a back-up item for each person in case their gift is no longer available. When choosing a back-up item, be sure to compare prices as you did with your original gift ideas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Start shopping before Cyber Monday!</h2>



<p>On Cyber Monday, make a plan to shop early enough so there’s less chance that your desired items will sell out. Many Cyber Monday deals have a limited time window, so do your research on particular websites before you get started. Prepare for the day and make sure that your WiFi connection is solid. You don’t want your computer crashing just before trying to make a purchase!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/ebatescanada-shopping-black-friday-xT0xeLj5TwbA0sb4xa"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/xT0xeLj5TwbA0sb4xa/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="Black Friday Shopping GIF by ebatescanada - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="480" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Be aware of hidden fees before checking out</h2>



<p>Be aware of secret fees! Often, most fees such as tax and shipping won’t appear until you’re ready to check out. Shipping fees can be hefty depending on the website that you&#8217;re using, so try and factor hidden tax and shipping fees into your budget when you’re planning your Cyber Monday shopping.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-turn-off-lights-when-you-leave-a-room-for-a-more-eco-friendly-lifestyle">1. Turn off lights when you leave a room for a more eco-friendly lifestyle</h2>



<p>Here’s an easy one! Turning off the lights when you leave a room may seem like a simple task, but it makes a huge impact. Not only will turning off lights save you money on your energy bill, but it will also reduce your carbon footprint.</p>



<p>You can even make the switch to energy-efficient light bulbs, such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). These bulbs will not only save energy but they will save you money too. Remember to turn off your lights next time you leave a room!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-easy-eco-friendly-lifestyle-switch-buy-a-reusable-water-bottle">2. Easy eco-friendly lifestyle switch: Buy a reusable water bottle</h2>



<p>Ditch the plastic! Reusable water bottles are cheaper and more sustainable than buying cases of plastic bottles. <a href="https://biofriendlyplanet.com/green-alternatives/reusables/the-environmental-advantages-of-reusable-water-bottles/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">38 million water bottles</a> end up in landfills in the United States each year.

<p>Buying a reusable water bottle, such as a Hydroflask, will not only reduce waste but improve your overall health as well. <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://biofriendlyplanet.com/green-alternatives/reusables/the-environmental-advantages-of-reusable-water-bottles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Plastic water bottles contain loads of chemicals, such as BPA</a>, that no one wants to be putting into their body.

<p>Avoid contributing to the fast fashion industry by purchasing clothes from thrift stores. Fast fashion is inexpensive clothing made by large companies. The fashion industry has a huge impact on the planet. This industry contributes to rising carbon emissions as well as pesticide use.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-use-reusable-grocery-bags">4. Use reusable grocery bags</h2>



<p>Another easy way to go green! Not only are reusable bags more durable than plastic, but they’re also safer for the environment. Switching to reusable grocery bags will help decrease plastic waste. Plastic bags (and water bottles) can take between 15 and 1,000 years to break down!</p>



<p>Plastic bags are also a health hazard for wildlife. Animals can get entangled in these bags and some may even try to eat these products. Help out our earth and wildlife by making this eco-friendly switch. Invest in a fashionable bag and you can even use it as a tote for other purposes!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-make-a-compost-bin">5. Make a compost bin</h2>



<p>Food waste contributes to around <a href="https://www.rebelgreen.com/composting-facts-tips/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">30% of the food supply</a> in the United States. Yikes! Composting is an awesome solution to this issue. Composting helps to keep out excess food out of landfills, and it helps to nourish the environment. Compost enriches the soil and aids in plant growth.</p>



<p>Use food scraps such as eggshells, fruit, and vegetables to create your compost. Not sure where to start? <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here for a simple guide on how to start composting at home!</a></p>

<p>Bonus Tip: Support nonprofits driving environmental change</p>



<p>Making small eco-conscious changes at home is a powerful start. You can amplify your impact by supporting organizations dedicated to protecting the planet. Whether through donations, volunteering, or partnerships, teaming up with the right nonprofit can turn your lifestyle changes into global action. Check out this list of <a href="https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/20-global-nonprofits-environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top nonprofits fighting for the environment</a> to find one that aligns with your values.</p>

<p>Saving for a vacation, a laptop, to pay off your student loans? Whatever you may be saving money for, setting up visual reminders in places you look the most will help you stay focused and save more.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re planning a vacation to see the northern lights, put up a photo/visual reminder of it in your bedroom, workstation, and even your bathroom. All these photos will remind you of your purpose.</p>



<p>Basically, if you love online shopping and can&#8217;t help it &#8211; try changing your phone and desktop background to a photo/creative that represents a fat zero or an empty wallet. This little activity will take the excitement out of your usual online haul.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Saving money the elite way: follow the 48-hour rule</h2>



<p>So you saw this really cool thing online, and you can&#8217;t wait to move the item from your virtual cart to your home. Give the item 48 hours before you buy it. You will only buy something that you really need, which makes your day-to-day tasks more manageable. Impulse buys = temporary happiness. Studies show that the joy of impulse buy is momentary, and an individual feels more stressed to have not saved that money. One of the best ways to cut expenses and save money is to give any buy 48 hours of consideration &#8211; if you really need it, you will be back to purchase it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our best money saving tip: Use cash instead of cards</h2>

<p>This trick is relatively simple but highly effective. If you have a specific weekly spending amount, encash it and use it for all your week&#8217;s purchases. This way, you will be able to track your expenditure and keep tabs on how much is left. Moreover, cards have a way of making us feel less guilty about our purchases and expenses. With cash, the parting pain is much greater compared to plastic tapping and swiping.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Explore cheaper plans</h2>



<p>Our phone and television plans can sum up to be quite hefty. Revaluate your needs based on your consumption. Choose the subscriptions that fit your lifestyle. You can alternatively <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/keep-track-expenses-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">decide to split television or online app plans with your roomis</a> to make it more sustainable. Remember, there are always cheaper plans and subscriptions available in the market which can help you save a lot of money.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bargain!! </h2>

<p>This is by far, the easiest of all the money saving tips that exist. Thrift shopping is like treasure hunting; one won&#8217;t know what they might find.
