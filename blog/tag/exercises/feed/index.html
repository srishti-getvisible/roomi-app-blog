<p>It looks like it&#8217;s going to be a long winter. The best adjustment you can make to your health routine while working from home is to start the day with some strength, flexibility and cardio exercises. If you do them before breakfast, you get your metabolism (and your productivity) fired up for the day. The best way to stay focused is to keep changing your workout routine, so why not take advantage of the space in your apartment and create a home gym? After all, you don&#8217;t need fancy equipment to have the best (and cheap) home gym around!</p>



<p> If the idea of working out in the comfort of your own home and saving money on fitness memberships sounds good, here are some tips to follow when setting up a home gym. Trainers all around the world swear by these 7 pieces of gear to make every home gym effective. Are you ready to work up a sweat?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. A mat</h2>



<p>This is not only the best, but also a cheap home gym equipment that you need to get started. There are two variations of mats available;&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=yoga+mat&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=thrillist0d-20&amp;linkId=d2660bec63d6e79ef26c63da1bba9a88&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">a yoga mat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/33tJyOO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a jump mat</a>. The latter is a bit thicker, and is used for much more intensive exercises. A jump mat can also double as a yoga mat if you prefer a little more cushioning.</p>



<p>Work out in your bedroom if you have the space (and want to Downward Dog in private) or convert your living room into a workout space with a few quick changes. Shift your furniture to the side to give your mat some space, and then you can binge-watch Netflix while you exercise. Just make sure your roommates are on-board with the set-up first.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Resistance bands</h2>



<p>Resistance bands are core pieces of equipment for a home gym. They take up very little space, and are versatile and cost-effective. They come in various resistance levels, so you will always have new ways to challenge yourself. Regardless of what you do, make sure you have a structured plan that covers all parts of the body, instead of doing a few reps of bicep curls or lunges, here or there.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Jump rope</h2>



<p>Every home gym needs a good licorice&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.verywellfit.com/best-jump-rope-4158057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jump rope</a>. A jump rope helps supplement workouts and keeps your feet moving when you might not get a full workout. There are many cheap jump ropes available for beginner exercises, and even advanced variations if you feel like taking your skipping to the next level. It&#8217;s a cheap addition to your home gym, but boy is it worth it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Dumbbells</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking to break out of bodyweight exercises all day, a set of dumbbells is just what you need. Storing them is pretty simple &#8211; keep them under the bed when you finish working out. Adjustable dumbbells add a little more heat to your routine., giving you the ability to go light or go heavy. The easiest way to keep challenging your body from workout to workout is to add more load and weight to the exercise. If you have the extra room, you can even get yourself&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=adjustable+dumbbells&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=thrillist0d-20&amp;linkId=29a894fa31fcb5728b788f904e2e615a&amp;language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">adjustable weights</a>&nbsp;for your dumbbells.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Pull-up bar</h2>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/10-best-pull-up-bars-of-2020/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">pull up bar</a>&nbsp;is one of the basics for a full home gym. If you&#8217;re new to pull-ups, you&#8217;ll likely feel like giving up quickly when you set up the bar and pump out. Even if you&#8217;re hardly moving, stay with it, as pull-ups are a great way to strengthen your upper body and core. The more you use the pull-up bar, the faster you&#8217;ll see results. You can easily attach the pull-up bar to your door frame without taking away from your limited floor space. Just do a pull-up every time you pass by, and you&#8217;ll see results in no time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Kettlebell</h2>



<p>This equipment is handy due to its size and functionality. It can be easily tucked away when you don&#8217;t need it, and can supplement your cardio exercises when you do. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-6-best-kettlebell-exercises-you-need-to-do.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kettlebells</a> offer full-body toning and enhance your cardio exercises, adding that extra strength and endurance challenge to your workout.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Workout bench</h2>



<p>You can place the working bench on the jump mats to complete your home gym. While this equipment is not necessary for all your fitness programs, it is critical for most weightlifting programs. Without a workout bench, you can still get a good workout, but if you do have the room, you might find it could switch up your whole routine.</p>

<p>It can be hard to establish an exercise routine when working from home &#8211; well, one we actually stick to, anyways. Working from home has given us extra time to complete chores, take on side projects, and enhance our skills. People are spending less time commuting every day, which has given us a new kind of flexibility in our schedules. But one part of our day hasn&#8217;t changed &#8211; and that&#8217;s our need to practice an everyday fitness routine.</p>



<p>We all know that regular physical activity keeps us fit. With more time to individualize our schedules, we may be under the impression that it gets easier to move around. But the reality for many of us is that finding the motivation to stay active is proving to be more difficult than we expected.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems when working from home is sitting for long hours at your desk. According to <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/health-promotion/physical-activity" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">research conducted by the WHO</a>, 31% of individuals who are 15 years of age or older are physically inactive, and approximately 3.2 million deaths per year are attributed to this unhealthy behavior. The result of sitting all day poses a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618737/#:~:text=Sedentary%20and%20sitting%20behavior%20in,death%20%5B9%2C10%5D" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">risk factor</a> for cardio-metabolic disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and coronary artery disease. Exercise also <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/#:~:text=Exercise%20improves%20mental%20health%20by,self%2Desteem%20and%20cognitive%20function.&amp;text=Exercise%20has%20also%20been%20found,self%2Desteem%20and%20social%20withdrawal.)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improves mental health</a> by reducing anxiety and elevating your mood. Here are some exercises that you can do while you&#8217;re sitting on your workstation or when you&#8217;re taking a break from work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chair exercises</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Torso stretch</h3>



<p>When sitting at your workstation, you can easily do <a href="https://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/exercises.asp?exercise=62" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">torso stretches</a> to energize yourself. It also helps you to maintain the correct posture. While sitting on the chair, intertwine your fingers and spread them upwards and backward repetitively. Repeat 5 – 10 times.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Spinal twist</h3>



<p>The spinal twist is a perfect stretch to soothe your tired back muscles from constantly sitting on the chair. First, sit straight with your feet flat on the floor and gently twist your torso on the axis. Stretch only to a comfortable point, making sure you don&#8217;t overstretch. Then repeat the exercise in the opposite direction. Repeat for a minute or two.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Chest opener</h3>



<p>You need to slide a little on the edge of the chair and hold the backrest&#8217;s sides with your arms. Stretch your body as you clasp the backrest. Hold for a minute to feel a little looser and more open.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Neck stretch</h3>



<p>A neck stretch requires a combination of breathing and stretching at the same time. Keeping your back straight and feet flat on the floor, gently rotate your neck. Breathe in and out in sync as you move your neck. Continue for a minute or two to feel refreshed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Indoor exercises</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Squats</h3>



<p>The best way to start a <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/squat-4-common-squat-mistakes-avoid/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">squat</a> is to stand straight, keeping your legs facing forward with feet slightly turned out, and cross your arms. Now try and sit down without your hands&#8217; support and stand up once you reach a full bend in your legs. Go for at least 10 reps, but keep at it if your stamina allows. Your aching muscles might be screaming at you in the first few days, but keep going and you&#8217;ll soon get used to it! You might even find it fun&#8230;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pushups</h3>



<p>For beginners, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/pushups-everyday#how-to" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushups</a> might seem a little difficult, but with continuous practice, you can get it right. Pushups are a bit like a plank without the lumbar support of your forearm. Push down with your palms on the floor to move upwards and then downwards, in sync with both hands. Go for 5-7 repetitions, and you can slowly increase on the number once you get comfortable. Pushups are useful for building your core strength, but if you&#8217;re struggling to get one, start on your knees and build up to straight legs.</p>
