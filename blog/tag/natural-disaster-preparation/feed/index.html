										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 has been a year of unexpected and disruptive disasters all around the globe. While many of these can be predictable, some pop out of nowhere, like the 2020 pandemic. Natural disaster preparation accounts for all of these situations; it helps you stay combat-ready for what may come<em>.&nbsp;</em>September of every year is the National Disaster Preparedness Month. Therefore, here are some vital disaster preparation tips ranging from emergency alerts, first aid kits, and all that you should know to stay prepared.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Disaster preparation 101: Know what to expect</h2>



<p>Each crisis calls for different treatment, preparation, supplies, and essentials. Part of disaster preparation is identifying what disasters your town or city is prone to. Next, plan accordingly. Here&#8217;s a list of the most common disasters:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">1. <strong><em>Storms &amp; Hurricanes</em></strong></h3>



<p>Places close to water bodies need to keep their eyes out for this. The East &amp; Gulf coasts are most prone to these disasters, especially between June and November.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">2. <strong><em>Earthquakes</em></strong></h3>



<p>No place can be labeled as disaster-free. Yes, not even landlocked regions<strong>.</strong>Â As tectonic plate movements are unpredictable, earthquakes can take place at any time of the year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">3. <strong><em>Floods</em></strong></h3>



<p>People living in low-lying land are at the most risk of this calamity. This includes places like Georgia, Massachusetts, North &amp; South Carolina, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">4. <strong><em>Wildfires</em></strong></h3>



<p>After the heart-wrenching Californian wildfires, all states with huge forest land and little rains are areas of concern.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">5. <strong><em>Tornadoes</em></strong></h3>



<p>TX, OK, IA, KS, NE, and OH are on high alert from March to August.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">6. <strong><em>Blizzards</em></strong></h3>



<p><em>They can happen in any region where the temperature drops below the freezing point.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Subscribe to emergency alerts</h2>



<p>You can get&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ready.gov/alerts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emergency alerts to help with disaster preparation on your phone.</a>&nbsp;The emergency alert system also broadcasts over both radio and TV. The NOAA weather radio intimates you if the weather is going to be severe. You can also get emergency alerts from free, reliable apps like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fema.gov/mobile-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FEMA</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/mobile-apps.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Cross</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pack a disaster preparation kit</h2>

<p>We&#8217;d recommend packing a similar go-bag of essentials for disaster preparation for your pet. To illustrate, here&#8217;s what you can add in their bag &#8211; food, water, bowls, a pet first aid kit, reflective collar &amp; leash, a name tag/GPS tracker, pet wipes, and any of their other essentials like medicines.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Disaster preparation for your home and your homies  </h2>



<p>Before leaving home, there are a few things to check. Make sure to disconnect all electrical appliances such as the air conditioner, microwave, lamps, etc.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">1. <strong><em>Pantry</em></strong></h3>



<p>Store all your emergency goods properly. In case of a flood alert, store all of your dry food items in a water-resistant box and on high shelves where water can&#8217;t reach.  When there is a flood warning, you can store goods like milk, fresh meat, and poultry in the freezer to increase shelf life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">2. <strong><em>Essentials</em></strong></h3>



<p>Always have extra of the essentials stacked at home. These include medicines, personal sanitation, food, and water.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">3. <strong><em>Evacuation</em></strong></h3>



<p>Plan and practice your evacuation routes with all your house members. It will ensure you all are well-versed with the course when disaster strikes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">4. <strong><em>Standard Medical Procedures</em></strong></h3>



<p>Simultaneously, now may be a good time to get acquainted with different medical procedures. For example, basic first aid, CPR, reviving someone who drowned, Heimlich maneuver, how to move an injured person and how to stop bleeding. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>El NiÃ±o is in full swing, and the Golden State is gearing up for a <a href="https://weather.com/news/climate/news/el-nino-outlook-strong-possible-may2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wet spring</a>. Thanks to a blistering year of drought, the state has been battling fires. These have left the soil loose, damaged, and prone to moving in the sudden drenching rain. As a result, Californians are keeping a vigilant eye out for floods and dangerous mudslides. This is why we&#8217;re talking about preparing a flood safety plan. </p>



<p>Since emergency preparedness is a many-headed beast, a quick glance over some general flood safety tips will only help you and your roommates be better off in an emergency. Especially since flash floods are the <a href="http://www.ready.gov/floods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">number one cause</a> of weather-related deaths in the U.S. So, ready to go back to school?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Prepare Before a Flood</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1604275689235-fdc521556c16?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="brown and white concrete house stuck in a flood where people in the house have a flood safety plan"/></figure>



<p>As with any emergency preparation, itâs not difficult, and a little practice can go a long way. Ready.gov and Dr. James Howard, a data scientist, and <a href="https://jameshoward.us/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flood insurance expert</a>, has a few easy tips to help you and your roommate be thoroughly prepared in the case of a flood.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Know your local area.</strong> </h3>



<p>Howard recommends knowing where the <a href="http://education.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/flood-plain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">floodplain</a> is, what your associated risk is, and the history of flooding in your area. If you know that you live in a high-risk area, keep your eye on the news. Make sure youâre ready to move by mapping out an escape route to higher ground ahead of time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prepare a kit.</strong> </h3>



<p>Yes, you hear it a lot, but common necessities are easy to overlook when theyâre always on hand. Youâll have little time to react in the event of a flood, and having a pre-packed bag of sealed foods, first-aid equipment, a flashlight, and batteries could mean the difference between life and death.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Get flood insurance.</strong> </h3>



<p>Do you have <a href="https://roomiapp.com/why-you-absolutely-need-renters-insurance-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">renters insurance</a>? Check and see if it covers the cost of floods. Most renters insurance will not, and even if you donât own your home, youâll need flood insurance to cover the loss of possessions due to flooding.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learn the flood safety tips before a flood, not during.</strong></h3>



<p>Make sure reviewing flood safety is part of the preparation plan for you and your roommates. The last thing you want is to be scrambling to educate yourself when the weatherman is telling you to hit the hills. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do not drive or walk-in floodwater.</strong> </h3>



<p>âDo not try to cross standing, and especially rushing, water either in a car or on foot,â warns Howard. âEven a couple of inches of moving water can sweep you off your feet or send a car out of control.â</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Turn your electricity off.</strong> </h3>



<p>âIf there is time, and itâs feasible, shutting off the power to your home at the main circuit breaker will reduce electrical risk inside the house,â says Howard. âOnce the waters are rising, avoid anything electrical, such as downed power lines.â</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do not drink, eat from, or be in contact with floodwater if possible</strong>. </h3>



<p>Floodwater is usually toxic and is notoriously accompanied by backed-up sewers, overflowing dumps, and collected waste and chemicals, so you do not want to be near it whatsoever. âLess obviously, clean yourself thoroughly with soap and clean water if youâve been in contact with floodwaters as soon as possible,â Howard suggests. âFloodwaters are chemically and biologically contaminated, and this will reduce the risk of an acquired infection.â </p>
