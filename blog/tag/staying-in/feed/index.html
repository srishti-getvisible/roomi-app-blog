										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the pandemic still a pressing issue in all of our lives, many of us have had to get creative with fun activities to do on the weekends after a long week of work.</p>



<p>Because of COVID-19 regulations and social distancing, the activities that we once loved to do on a night out are not possible now. Most bars and restaurants now have a curfew and some are closed altogether. But, don’t get discouraged! <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/3-traits-look-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you live with roommates,</a> now is the perfect time to get creative and think of fun activities to do at home with your roommates for a fun-filled weekend.</p>



<p>Before you dismiss the idea that staying in on the weekends can’t be fun, check out this list of fun ideas for a night in with you and your roommates. Who knows, you may even create a few new weekend traditions with your roommates!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-powerpoint-night">PowerPoint Night</h2>



<p>This creative spin on creating PowerPoints has recently become a popular TikTok trend. Turn a boring PowerPoint into a laugh-out-loud game for you and your roommates with a <a href="https://slidemodel.com/powerpoint-night-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerPoint night</a>!</p>



<p>In order to participate, each of your roommates will choose a fun or funny topic to present a PowerPoint on. The topic can be anything you want; the sky’s the limit! However, everyone’s topic must be kept a secret until it’s time to present your PowerPoint.</p>



<p>If you’re stuck on what to do your presentation on, draw on your favorite celebs, movies, shows, or make your PowerPoints personal about you and your friends. Take turns presenting your PowerPoints and get ready to laugh out loud!</p>
