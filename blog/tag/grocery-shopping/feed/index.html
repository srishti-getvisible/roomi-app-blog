<p></p>



<p>Now that you’ve unpacked your boxes and are somewhat settled into your first apartment, the next (big) step is grocery shopping. Remember, your first homemade meal in your first apartment is special! But before that, you have to prepare the ingredients and everything else you need. So, in creating your first apartment grocery list, make sure to include these essentials.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="kitchen-pantry">Kitchen/Pantry</h3>



<p>Usually, the pantry includes everything that you’ll buy most often or the staples you like to keep around the house. These can be snacks, cooking essentials, or beverages (such as coffee, of course!).</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Cooking oil</li><li>Bread</li><li>Rice</li><li>Peanut butter</li><li>Jelly</li><li>Easy-to-eat canned goods</li><li>Pancake mix</li><li>Cereals</li><li>Pasta</li><li>Pasta sauce</li><li>Coffee essentials (beans/instant coffee, creamer, sugar)</li><li>Tea</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="fridge-freezer">Fridge-Freezer</h3>



<p>Having your fridge-freezer full is a good to-do for your first apartment as you’ll be saving money from not eating out. Plus, proteins you won’t eat immediately can be kept in the freezer until you need them, while food for the following week can be stored in the fridge and cooked when you’re hungry. Here’s what you should keep stocked in the fridge-freezer:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Meat (ground beef, chicken, pork chops)</li><li>Seafood (fish, shrimp)</li><li>Eggs</li><li>Milk</li><li>Butter</li><li>Cheese</li><li>Fresh fruits and vegetables</li><li>Fried food (hotdogs, fries, sausage, bacon)</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="spices-and-condiments">Spices and Condiments</h3>



<p>Cooking delicious food requires some basic spices, so make sure to have these in your kitchen. More than that, having condiments and sauces can add that extra kick to your meals. Here are some of the basics you need:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Salt</li><li>Pepper</li><li>Garlic powder</li><li>Chili powder</li><li>Ketchup</li><li>Mayonnaise</li><li>Mustard</li><li>Salad dressing</li><li>Hot sauce</li><li>Vinegar</li><li>Soy sauce</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="baking">Baking</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="19596" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/first-apartment-grocery-list/attachment/baking-goods/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1920,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="baking-goods" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="baking-goods" class="wp-image-19596" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=1250%2C834&amp;ssl=1 1250w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/baking-goods.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<p>You don’t need to be an expert baker to make cookies or even banana bread! So, grabbing these ingredients is totally harmless, not to mention you might even develop a skill or two. Plus, these ingredients don’t spoil easily, so even if you’re not big on baking, keeping them in your kitchen until you need them is totally fine. Just make sure to keep them in air-locked containers or zip-top bags to stave away bugs.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>All-purpose flour</li><li>Baking powder</li><li>Baking soda</li><li>Granulated sugar</li><li>Yeast</li><li>Shortening</li><li>Canola or vegetable oil</li><li>Vanilla extract</li><li>Toppings (Chocolate chips, nuts, sprinkles)</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="toiletries">Toiletries</h3>



<p>If you didn’t bring any with you or just want to stock up, toiletries should be part of your first apartment grocery list. Here’s everything you need for the bathroom.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Shampoo and conditioner</li><li>Body and hand soap</li><li>Facial cleanser</li><li>Toothbrush and toothpaste</li><li>Mouthwash</li><li>Floss</li><li>Cotton swabs</li><li>Feminine hygiene products</li><li>Facial wipes</li><li>Toilet paper</li><li>First aid kit</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cleaning-supplies">Cleaning Supplies</h3>



<p>Not only can you get an exercise out of cleaning, but also a clearer mind (and better focus). With that, keeping your first apartment squeaky clean should be a priority! So, to have a clean and tidy living environment, include these cleaning supplies in your apartment grocery list:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Paper towels</li><li>Garbage bags</li><li>Zip-top storage bags (Ziploc bags)</li><li>Dishwashing materials (sponge and soap)</li><li>All-purpose cleaner</li><li>Laundry detergent</li><li>Rubbing alcohol</li><li>Baking soda (this is GREAT <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/8-cheap-bathroom-cleaning-hacks-to-ease-your-chore-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">for cleaning</a>!)</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tips-for-your-new-apartment-shopping-list">Tips for your New Apartment Shopping List</h3>



<p>Now that you’ve got a rough idea of what to shop for while settling into your first apartment, here are a few tips. You can also find a few <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/8-secrets-to-spending-less-while-grocery-shopping-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">grocery shopping secrets</a> that can come in handy for your first apartment grocery list.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Don’t shop hungry!</strong> Giving in to temptations (and impulse buys) is much easier when you’re hungry. Maybe you didn’t need those three packs of Oreos after all&#8230; To avoid this, eat a snack before going shopping or simply go once you’ve had a meal.</li><li><strong>Budget accordingly.</strong> Shopping for groceries is fun (especially if you’re shopping for yourself), but remember to follow your budget! When going for groceries, one thing you can do to follow your budget is have a specific amount of cash on hand. With this, you’d be avoiding overspending because you’d only be spending what you have in your pocket.</li><li><strong>Organize your list.</strong> Having your first apartment grocery list organized will make shopping much more manageable. Put similar items together so when you’re walking through the aisles, you’ll be able to grab them all in a single go rather than having to double back to aisles you’ve been to previously.</li><li><strong>Consider your space.</strong> If you’re a college student or a young professional living in a tiny apartment, you may have limited space. When shopping for groceries, think about the space they will take up. You may think buying a lot of canned food is okay until you’re trying to fit them all on your shelf!</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Grocery shopping bills are a necessary expense that takes up a major chunk of our earnings. With the quarantine on our hands, most of us spend our time devouring 6-7 meals per day to beat boredom. When we go grocery shopping, we can&#8217;t help but fall prey to consumerism and end up spending wayyy more than we planned! Roomi shares every good grocery secret out there.</p>



<p>If cutting down your grocery shopping bills is on your mind, here are some secret tips that have been proven to work, if followed diligently. You&#8217;re welcome!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-1-make-a-meal-plan-before-grocery-shopping">Secret #1: Make a meal plan before grocery shopping</h2>



<p>This simple yet effective tip not only saves you time but tons of money. Imagine going grocery shopping with no dish in mind and deciding your weekly needs while standing in front of the veggie stand <em>(aargh, been there done that)</em>. Be smart, and get ahead of yourself &#8211; make a weekly meal plan and stick to it. Make use of what you already have in your pantry when creating your meal plan to avoid food waste</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-2-make-a-monthly-budget-for-your-grocery-shopping">Secret #2: Make a monthly budget for your grocery shopping</h2>



<p>This may be a little tough for most of you initially, but it will be super rewarding once you reach the end of the month and realize that you stuck to your budget! The trick is to give yourself a reasonable figure like &#8211;&nbsp;<em>&#8220;I will only spend 30dollars a week on groceries.&#8221;</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>&#8220;I have reserved 100 dollars for grocery this month.&#8221;&nbsp;</em>Roll with this idea like a way of challenging yourself to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-easy-tricks-to-spend-less-save-more-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">spend less and save more.</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-3-no-grocery-shopping-on-an-empty-stomach">Secret #3: No grocery shopping on an empty stomach!</h2>



<p>Ahh, this is a rookie mistake &#8211; NEVER go grocery shopping when you&#8217;re hungry, as you will end up buying much more than you need <em>(everything looks super yum when you&#8217;re hungry)</em>. Eat a light snack or a meal before you go grocery shopping.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-4-write-a-grocery-shopping-list">Secret #4: Write a grocery shopping list</h2>



<p>This is no secret sauce; our mothers, fathers, and grandparents have been doing this for decades now, and for good reasons. While you&#8217;re preparing your weekly meal plans, add the items you need before you go grocery shopping. This will let you stay within your budget and not lose focus with all the yummies around you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-5-make-the-most-of-leftovers">Secret #5: Make the most of leftovers</h2>



<p><em>In the United States,&nbsp;<strong>food waste</strong>&nbsp;is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the&nbsp;<strong>food</strong>&nbsp;supply.</em></p>



<p>A part of this food wastage is partly down to American households not planing their meals properly and tossing the leftovers. One can always use leftovers by reheating or turning it into another fantastic dish. Have leftover pasta? Add it to a bowl of soup! Leftover chicken? Add it to a salad! The opportunity to create something new is endless, just be a little creative.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-secret-6-buy-what-s-on-sale">Secret #6: Buy what&#8217;s on sale</h2>



<p>Do you ever check grocery shopping sale ads online? If you don&#8217;t, now is the right time to start! Say, for example, if you spotted chicken on sale, try and come up with different recipes that you can make throughout the week with this main ingredient. This can apply to almost all ingredients! </p>



<p>If you see a bunch of ingredients on sale, plan your weekly meals accordingly. It will help you stay within your budget and keep you feelin&#8217; creative! The&nbsp;<a href="https://flipp.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flipp app</a>&nbsp;can help you see the items on sale in your zip code. Works great to keep those grocery shopping bills under check!</p>
