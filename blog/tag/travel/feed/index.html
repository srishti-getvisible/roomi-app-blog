										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We&#8217;re still dreaming of taking our masks off in the wild. All while looking forward to a world with no restrictions, so we can realize our greatest travel dreams.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s taking a tad bit longer than we&#8217;d like, yes?</p>



<p>So what can we do right now to work on our travel dreams? Apart from vicariously <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/6-travel-books-for-your-wandering-soul-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">traveling through the books written by envied wanderers</a>?</p>



<p>You could <strong>SAVE FOR YOUR NEXT TRIP</strong>!</p>



<p>And make sure there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from traveling to your heart&#8217;s content when we finally triumph over the disease.</p>



<p>Whether you plan to free solo or do it with your friends or fam, you need to start making your individual budget to go execute your wildest travel dreams.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/managing-personal-finance-by-sticking-to-your-budget-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get our budgeting hats out</a>, and keep our world map ready to start building our travel funds!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-choose-your-vacation-destination">1. Choose your vacation destination</h2>



<p>We all want to go around the world in 80 days, but unfortunately, we&#8217;d need tons of money to do that. And anyway, what&#8217;s the fun if you can&#8217;t take your time to fully experience each place you travel to, like a true local?</p>



<p>So when you dream of your next vacation, start by choosing a place, and then save accordingly.</p>



<p>Depending on whether it&#8217;s within the country or abroad, take a world map and mark the place you want to visit with a big diagrammatic heart. Or whatever you fancy!</p>



<p>This will keep you focused on your goal (especially when you&#8217;re <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-comedy-movies-to-watch-when-you-hate-your-job-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working from home for a job you hate</a>.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-how-much-will-it-cost">2. How much will it cost?</h2>



<p>Now that you have the place in mind, do your research. How much is the flight going to cost?</p>



<p>Next step: research about cost of living, food, etc, along with hunting for the best travel deals.</p>



<p>Even though the rates might be affected by the pandemic right now, you can always head to blogs and resources of the pandemic past, to put an estimated cost against your dream vacation. To further optimize your travel budget, consider the advantages ofÂ <a href="https://www.weareplanet.com/blog/tax-free-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tax-free shopping for tourists</a>. This can greatly reduce the cost of souvenirs and other purchases you make abroad, allowing you to allocate more of your funds towards experiencing local culture and attractions.</p>



<p>However, you don&#8217;t have to fix the exact budget now. This is just to know how much you would approximately need.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-how-far-can-you-cheap-out">3. How far can you cheap out?</h2>



<p>Now there are two types of wanderers, so you have got to pick your squad.</p>



<p>One is the tribe of luxury lovers, influenced by influencers, doing it for the &#8216;gram. If you relate to this, you&#8217;d want to visit one destination that you can think about for the rest of the year &#8211; with #tbt filling your social media handles.</p>



<p>And the other is the type of people who would do anything to make it as cheap as they can, so they can move around like nomads till their feet are tired, and their hearts satiated.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve picked the tribe you relate to, plan your budget accordingly.</p>



<p>If you relate to the former kind, find yourself travel deals that will help you travel luxuriously without going broke.</p>



<p>And if you&#8217;re the latter kind, head on to travel forums to figure out the possible frugality of cheap travel &#8211; think travel deals, couch surfing, au pair, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-netflix-and-chill-or-travel-and-thrill">4. Netflix and chill or travel and thrill?</h2>



<p>Another <em>&#8216;choose what kind of person you are&#8217;</em> game, think about how much you spend on subscriptions like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.</p>



<p>Now think about how much that would add to your travel fund? It&#8217;s simply a matter of choices!</p>



<p>While not cutting down drastically, all you have to do is let go of your subscriptions. You will still have Youtube, and netizens can surely hack their way around the internet when it comes to entertainment.</p>



<p>You could also <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-ways-to-ask-parents-for-money-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ask your friends and family</a> for their passwords when you really NEED to watch something!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-earn-more-money-for-your-vacation-fund">5. Earn more money for your vacation fund</h2>



<p>&#8230; And put it all into your travel fund.</p>



<p>In this work from the home era, there might be plenty of online jobs (stay aware of scams though) and earn a little bit on the side.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t worry about giving more of your free time to work. Think about the bigger picture and it&#8217;ll all be worth it!</p>



<p>Good luck and happy travel dreams to ya!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re like us, you&#8217;re probably dreaming of traveling all the time but to no avail. So, if you&#8217;re putting all that dreaming energy into looking at travel pictures on Instagram, we have an alternative for you- nature documentaries! We&#8217;ve compiled for you a list of the best wildlife documentaries out there! These amazing animal documentaries will help you vicariously travel when you miss the great outdoors. </p>



<p>Some movies will make you laugh, some will make you cry, but all of them are sure to immerse you in the beauty of our planet while you stay at home. You might be <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/bored-in-the-house-heres-a-new-perspective-roomi/">bored in the house</a> right now, but we&#8217;ve got faith that we&#8217;ll be able to explore Planet Earth again very soon!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Planet Earth, 2006</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>There&#8217;s no better way to feel the oneness of nature than watching the many wonders of our world. Awe-inspiring landscapes ranging from majestic mountains to waterways, deserts, and ice-covered worlds, along with a glimpse into the behavior of rare animals in their natural habitat, this nature documentary will take you to the deep corners of the Earth. Put this on, sit on your couch, and enjoy the incredible footage of our planet set to the serene voice of Sir David Attenborough. Give it a go, it&#8217;s one of the most beautiful nature documentaries out there!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>When everything around us seems to be falling apart, a great way to cope is to resort to the mysteries and beauty of transience. Rivers and Tides &#8211; a documentary on the life and work of land artist, Andy Goldsworthy &#8211; paints the most beautiful picture of impermanence.</p>



<p>The director, Thomas Riedelsheimer follows Goldsworthy around in the wilderness as he creates magical outdoor sculptures and artworks using natural materials such as mud, wood, ice, stone, petals, twigs, and branches. The ephemeral nature of the art he creates is evident in the way it interacts with the environment and will give you a much-needed dose of nature.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Jane, 2017</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>This list of the best nature and wildlife documentaries wouldn&#8217;t be complete without Jane Goodall. If you&#8217;re ready for an adventure that fascinates you- this one&#8217;s for you. This is one of those animal documentaries that makes you fall in love with the world around you. Because, trust us, you will be sobbing while watching the credit reel. </p>



<p>So, embark on a beautiful adventure with Jane Goodall as she lives with and studies apes in Tanzania. It&#8217;s a love story between Jane and apes on the one hand and with her cameraman husband, Hugo van Lawick, on the other hand. This film has all the feels you need! You need to watch this, it&#8217;s one of the best wildlife documentaries in the world!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Last Chance To See, 2009</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This documentary is a follow up to a book and radio series written by Douglas Adams. You might know him as the Author of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386162.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy</a>. Actually, this nature documentary series can be considered the hitchhiker&#8217;s guide to planet Earth! Trust us, it&#8217;s one of the most engaging nature documentaries out there!</p>



<p>It chronicles the expeditions of Adams (played by Stephen Fry) and zoologist Mark Carwardine as they set forth on a mission to find some of the most endangered species around the world. So, if you&#8217;re craving for and daydreaming about your next adventure with your roomi, this one is for you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Life, 2009</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Animal documentaries don&#8217;t get better than this. So, as we adapt and change according to our dreadful current scenario, escape to the new normal. Take a look into the lives of the most bizarre and unusual behavior for survival around the world. Travel across all continents and habitats with this nature documentary that will refresh your perspective on change and life itself! It&#8217;s one of the best wildlife documentaries, don&#8217;t miss it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Animals Are Beautiful People, 1974</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This is one of the funniest nature documentaries out there and it&#8217;s brought to you by the directors of &#8216;The Gods Must Be Crazy&#8217;. It&#8217;s a hilarious and perfect for the days when you need to let off some steam. So, get out that bottle of wine and watch animals while they get drunk on fermented fruit to deal with life in desert environments (much like our travel deprived minds). Man, animal documentaries sure are fascinating!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. The National Parks: America&#8217;s Best Idea, 2009</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This is one of the best nature documentaries out there. So, if you&#8217;re a fan of history and how things came to be, you need to indulge in this six-part history-come-travel documentary.

From how they came to be to the people who saved them from destruction, this nature documentary, narrated by actors like Tom Hanks, Sam Waterston and Andy Garcia, will educate and delight you!</p>
