<p>Patience is key, and you&#8217;ve got to learn to be a little more realistic with yourself buddy (if you want to nail your resolutions!).</p>



<p>So, here are some healthy and totally achievable New Year Resolutions for 2021!</p>



<p><em>Pssst&#8230; we added some hilarious New Year Resolution memes to lighten the mood.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Budgeting</h2>



<p>If there&#8217;s anything 2020 has taught us, it&#8217;s that we need to budget and save more money. This New Year resolution will help you in the long run, because even the best of us need savings for a rainy day!</p>



<p>This New Year 2021 try apps like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mint.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mint</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">You Need a Budget</a>&nbsp;which can help you track your spendings and stick to your budget like a boss!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Food for thought!</h2>



<p>A sharp mind and great vocab are by-products of reading. Can you think of a better month to start reading than January? We can&#8217;t! Just make a warm cup of cappuccino and snuggle up with your favorite novel. If your new year&#8217;s resolution is to read at least 12 books by the end of the year &#8211;&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up on Goodreads.</a>&nbsp;Review each of your new reads and track how many books you read in 2021 &#8211; challenging yourself is always fun!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Connect with God or explore spirituality</h2>



<p>2020 has been a tough and challenging year for all of us. Yet, many people found peace and joy in God or through finding themselves spiritually.&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://billygraham.org/story/searching-for-peace-spend-time-with-god/#15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Here&#8217;s an easy step by step guide by Billy Graham to get you started</a> on your journey. If not, why not listen to some uplifting music? Some great gospel artists include Rivers &amp; Robots, Johnathan Ogden &amp; Hillson, and you can find them on Spotify or youtube! A great and achievable New Year resolution, indeed!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Make quiet time a daily habit, but don’t get discouraged if you occasionally miss a day or two. You wouldn’t quit eating if you missed breakfast.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>&#8211; <a href="http://billygraham.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billygraham.org</a></em></cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Giving Back</h2>



<p>Leading research shows that volunteering can help to reduce stress and even lower blood pressure. What&#8217;s better than giving back to a community or a cause that you feel super passionate about? Not much! So if supporting a cause is what you want to try as your new year&#8217;s resolution, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a34429072/giving-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here&#8217;s a great tool-kit to get you started in the art of giving back!</a></p>
