<p>If you’re a film buff (and you have to be if you’re living in LA), you’re going to love this one. Echo Park is significant to the early Hollywood silent films. Then known as Edendale (now split into Echo Park, Los Feliz and Silver Lake), was where the first silent film studios were set up. In fact, Charlie Chaplin used to live in Echo Park!</p>

Today, the trendiest cafes, bars, shops are all here. And with the quintessential LA Mediterranean climate along with a beautiful Lake, Echo Park is one of the best neighborhoods in LA to live in. So, now that you’ve made up your mind about living here, let’s see how we can find cheap rooms for rent in Echo Park!</p>

In fact, it’s one of the most congested cities to drive in. Echo Park is near the 101, the 2, and the 5 freeways.
