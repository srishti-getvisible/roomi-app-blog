<p>Life with a&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-im-stuck-coliving-with-roommates-i-dont-like-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">roommate</a>&nbsp;isn’t always rainbows and butterflies — even we’ll admit to that. But when you have to share a space with someone, it’s vital to find a way to get along. Even if that means looking past the stack of dirty dishes&nbsp;or overflowing garbage can. But when the little stuff becomes too much to handle for one party, it can create palpable tension that can quickly turn toxic.</p>



<p>Good communication is the key to a healthy roommate relationship, but if you’re getting bad vibes without a clear reason why, you might have a serious issue on your hands.&nbsp;We talked to an expert on common behaviors of a passive-aggressive roommate and how to deal if you’re living with one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-passive-aggression">What is Passive Aggression?</h3>



<p>Psychology professor and clinical psychologist&nbsp;<a href="http://psychology.nova.edu/faculty/profile/dorfman.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dr. William Dorfman</a>&nbsp;defines passive-aggressive behavior as a dishonest expression of anger and hostility — an indirect expression of feelings people don’t want to confront. The most serious implication of this behavior is that doesn’t directly solve problems but rather expresses resentment&nbsp;and disapproval, making it difficult to deal with or improve a situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-signs-of-a-passive-aggressive-roommate">What are the Signs of a Passive-Aggressive Roommate?</h2>



<p>Thirty-year-old blogger, Chloe, who prefers not to use her real name, knows what this feels like. She and a friend lived with a passive-aggressive roommate in a townhouse during her freshman year of college. She says their&nbsp;roommate regularly passive-aggressively found ways to be inconsiderate. Eventually, the situation escalated to the point they felt uncomfortable in their own home.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“He would leave messes, and we would have to clean up after him, but then he would complain about me to the third roommate or about her to me,” says. “It became very uncomfortable because we would end up just trying to avoid him to keep the peace. It was like the tension became our fourth roommate. It was this real thing that was always present. You aren’t home without comfort and feeling protected and safe. When that is stripped from you, you avoid home until it’s late. You have no peace, no comfort.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>While anyone can react to a difficult situation passive-aggressively, Dorfman says some consistent behaviors indicate it’s not&nbsp;someone simply blowing off steam.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“It’s inherently an interpersonal process and a personality trait.&nbsp;Sometimes, we even diagnose it in clinical psychology as a passive-aggressive personality disorder when it really characterizes a person, not just once in a while.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>To add, here are some common passive-aggressive behaviors that your roommate might exhibit along with strategies for dealing with them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-procrastination-on-chores">1. Procrastination on chores</h3>



<p>No matter how many times you ask your roommate to do something, they’ll make excuses until it becomes obvious that they’re not happy. They might&nbsp;say they’re going to do the dishes after you ask, but it never happens. Repetitive procrastination&nbsp;is likely an indication of not wanting to do something.</p>



<p>Dorfman says,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“We all procrastinate, but when you procrastinate with someone else, it affects the other person’s rights and they’re left with the problem.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-being-forgetful-and-late">2. Being forgetful and late</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive roommate consciously or unconsciously forgets what’s asked of them, or is constantly late. Lateness, according to Dorfman, is another way of saying &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take control of the situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>For example, you may ask your roommate to arrive home by a certain time so you can rest, but they’ll be late and say they forgot your request. Or they may forget that you asked them not to eat your food in the fridge. When your roommate makes it a habit&nbsp;to be inconsiderate, it can be a sure sign of passive aggressiveness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-silent-treatment">3. Silent treatment</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive roommate may also shut down when faced with conflict. Instead of talking about the issue, they express neither hostility nor honesty. Rather than negotiating to solve an uncomfortable situation, they give you the silent treatment.</p>



<p>Not talking, Chloe says, was one of the main issues in her roommate relationship. Looking back now, she says she’s more aware of what to look for.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“The person will either say nothing was wrong or lash out. Either way, I would try to bring a peaceful and calm environment to whatever forum you decide to have and just keep having communication lines open.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-actions-don-t-match-the-attitude">4. Actions don&#8217;t match the attitude</h3>



<p>Perhaps the most toxic passive-aggressive behavior is acting one way and feeling another. They come across as being insincere or “fake nice”. For example, your roommate might ask you to “pick up” some toilet paper from the store, but it eventually becomes a routine.&nbsp;Dorfman likens the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/coliving-101-help-my-roommate-talks-behind-my-back-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">situation</a>&nbsp;to someone stabbing you in the back while smiling to your face.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“Often people who are passive-aggressive have an obvious, gratuitous attitude toward you that is not consistent with the way they act,” Dorfman says. “If you’re smiling at someone and being very sweet and friendly, how can you be angry?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-your-roommate-doesn-t-have-a-good-reason-to-be-angry">5. Your roommate doesn’t have a good reason to be angry</h3>



<p>Not every passive-aggressive roommate necessarily procrastinates or is stubborn and manipulative. The root of the behaviors of your roommate could also be that they don’t like being limited by others. Before jumping to conclusions, you should consider this first.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“If you’re not doing anything to instill or create any frustration or resentment, they don’t need to act in a passive-aggressive way,” Dorfman says. “It’s only when they’re called upon to do something or they’re not getting their way. Rather than address that they’re frustrated, they shut down and become stubborn, quiet, and withdrawn.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“They keep on saying, ‘I’m going to do it’ and ‘I’m sorry,’ and yet you continue to feel resentful about them. So, when your feelings don’t match up and you’re left confused about how you should deal with this person, that’s one indication that it’s not necessarily you. You’re getting mixed messages from this person.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-backhanded-compliments">6. Backhanded compliments</h3>



<p>Backhanded compliments are comments or expressions that seem positive at first, but it&#8217;s actually an insult. These are also known as &#8220;non-compliments&#8221; or &#8220;disguised insults&#8221; as backhanded compliments are usually indirect and subtle.</p>



<p>Some examples of backhanded compliments are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When you get a new haircut and your roommate says, &#8220;your haircut makes your nose look smaller.&#8221;</li>



<li>You&#8217;re going out for the night and they say, &#8220;that&#8217;s a beautiful dress on you. I didn&#8217;t even realize it was you at first glance.&#8221;</li>



<li>When your roommate comments on how your room or personal space looks: &#8220;I wish I was as relaxed as you in this mess.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-being-sarcastic">7. Being sarcastic</h3>



<p>Having a sarcastic roommate can be tiresome if it gets too much. It&#8217;s similar to backhanded compliments in a way that both are verbal and indirect, but sarcastic comments are a bit more upfront than backhanded compliments.</p>



<p>Plus, sarcasm is usually with irony or mockery that can be hurtful, especially with roommates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-slamming-doors-intentionally">8. Slamming doors intentionally</h3>



<p>Another sign of having a passive-aggressive roommate is when they slam the doors to your apartment intentionally. For example, you had an argument, you told them off, or confronted them on something they did, then they suddenly leave the apartment then slam the door on their way out. It&#8217;s disrespectful and can disturb others living the apartment or even on the same floor, as the noise of the door slamming travels through the hallway.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-deal-with-a-passive-aggressive-roommate-tips-amp-tricks">How to Deal with a Passive-Aggressive Roommate: Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<p>It’s normal to feel angry when <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-to-set-in-apartments-for-rent-with-roommates/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dealing</a> with the behaviors of a passive-aggressive roommate. But the thing to keep in mind with passive-aggressive roommates is, you can&#8217;t change them.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“[You] can get them to stop eating their food a lot easier than they can get them to become more open with their anger and more responsible with their feelings,” Dorfman says. “You deal with the specific situation, not with the personality.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>As per Dorfman, some solutions to dealing with a passive-aggressive roommate are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tell your roommate you&#8217;re frustrated, ask them what&#8217;s going on, and discuss your concerns with them. But you should also be prepared for them to get defensive and shut down.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Talk to someone you trust who can see the situation objectively to get their perspective.</li>



<li>Try going to therapy or counseling to work things out if both are willing.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, the solutions depend on how volatile the behaviors of your roommate are.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“Passive-aggressive style is on a continuum; it’s not all or nothing. Certain people are more passive-aggressive than others, so I wouldn’t count anyone out who has a particular difficulty with someone,” Dorfman says. “You have to make the effort to try to resolve the issues and call somebody on what’s going on.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-solution-to-dealing-with-passive-aggressive-roommates">The Solution to Dealing with Passive-Aggressive Roommates</h2>



<p>Finding new roommates may be the solution to dealing with a passive-aggressive roommate. By seeking out individuals who are more communicative and considerate, you can create a more positive and harmonious living environment. Don&#8217;t let one negative experience discourage you from finding roommates who will bring joy and positivity to your home.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dealing with loud roommates at night</h2>



<p>If you have a noisy roommate who is keeping you up at night, you should first try to take matters into your own hands. Here are some of the ways you can cut the noise and sleep better with loud roommates at night.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Earbuds or Headphones</h3>

<p>If your noisy roommates are hampering your sleep, consider investing in a pair of foam earbuds. They are a cheap and easy way to cancel out the noise and sleep better if you have loud roommates. If the roommate noise is beyond the powers of earbuds, you could use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=sony+710n&amp;qid=1622370845&amp;sr=8-4" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">noise-canceling headphones</a> instead. These are much more effective when it comes to cutting out the noise and letting you sleep better. If you are the type who listens to music while heading to bed, that may be a great way to unwind and cut the noise of your loud roommates at night.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Soundproof your room:</h3>

<p>If the earbuds or headphones aren&#8217;t helping, you may want to consider soundproofing your room.

<p>If you still can&#8217;t get your quality shut-eye time, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magicteam-Machine-Looping-Soothing-Function/dp/B07RWRJ4XW/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;keywords=white+noise+machine&amp;qid=1622370930&amp;sr=8-7">white noise machine</a> may be a good purchase. This machine emits white noise, that will drown the noise and help you deal with a noisy roommate. If you don&#8217;t want to purchase a white noise machine, you could simply play some white noise from your phone or speakers instead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communicating your problems</h2>



<p>If you weren&#8217;t able to tackle the issue yourself or your noisy roommate persists in their ways, it may be time to have a talk. You should make your problems clear and out them in a way that does not seem aggressive or rude. Loud roommates can be a pain to tolerate and maybe talking to them is the only option left.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Tell them how you feel:</h3>



<p>Let your noisy roommate know that their noise is causing you trouble sleeping and that you have tried to deal with it yourself. A considerate roommate will understand your issue and be willing to make changes for you. Make them realize that their noise seeps into your room and that you don&#8217;t mind as long as this does not happen.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Be polite and calm</h3>



<p>Be sure to stay calm and polite while explaining your concerns to your loud roommates. Do not make them feel like you are attacking them or their lifestyle and assure them that you just want some quiet at night. Tell them that you have tried to deal with it yourself and failed, hence are letting them know about your issues.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Make a noise complaint:</h3>



<p>If your noisy roommates refuse to be considerate after your try everything to deal with the problem, you may need to make a complaint. Talk to your building manager or dorm warden to let them know the problem you are facing. Leave it in their hands to take the issue further and deal with it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set rules</h2>



<p>Once the matter is finally settled, have a chat with your noisy roommates to work out rules and timings regarding noise. This is the best way to make sure that you have a mutual understanding and that the issues are solved. Framing a simple set of rules for your dorm or apartment can make life easier for everyone and help maintain peace with your noisy roommates. Make sure you avoid conflict and try to make them understand and empathize with your problem.</p>

<p>As we all know, a stoner regularly takes or is <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stoner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">habitually high on drugs</a>, for example, cannabis, marijuana. Living with a stoner roommate can be exhausting, but they live by etiquette that will guide you. Not every 420 friendly roommate abides by the same code of social behavior, but some guidelines can live with persistence.</p>



<p>There are pros and cons to living with a pothead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros of living with a pothead</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. They are creative thinkers.</strong></h3>



<p>While some stoner roommates sit around moping all day long, the majority run successful businesses. They say that weed relaxes an overactive mind and stimulates the brain to think outside the box. You can be rest assured that they won’t delay rent payments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Allows for deeper connection.</strong></h3>



<p>Living with a pothead allows for deeper connection, a special kind of bond. A stoner roommate tends to be more honest and vulnerable. They are very loyal, and this will open you to appreciate how endearing and incomprehensible they are. Your <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.420smokers.us/living-with-a-stoner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">420 friendly roommate</a> will have many hours of deep conversations with you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. They&#8217;re fun and chill.</strong></h3>



<p>Your 420 friendly roommate knows how to chill and have fun. You already know their favorite hobby is smoking, and they love to get cozily ensconced at home surrounded by food and friends. Sometimes they act differently, not in a scary way but probably more relaxed and high. Well, surprisingly, this can be a great thing since <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://elitedaily.com/wellness/how-much-weed-smoke-to-relieve-stress/1962753/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking pot relieves stress</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cons of living with a pothead</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>1. Losing connection with the outside world: </strong></h3>



<p>Living with a pothead who smokes too much weed will subconsciously let it diminish their opportunities to make the most out of life. They end <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/culture/from-a-stoner-to-a-stoner-why-smoking-too-much-weed-can-fck-up-your-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing their connection</a> with the outside world, not caring about what they see and what happens to them. It is a mental and physical numbness that triggers a loss of regard for the people, responsibilities, and potential for growth within your immediate and ever-evolving life.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>2. Accidentally eat a pot brownie</strong>.</h3>



<p><strong>I</strong>f your 420 friendly roommate is a jerk, they can sneak some, especially when they don’t respect your choices. The best thing is to avoid home-baked pastries or pastries you didn’t purchase or make yourself.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>3. They have a funky smell</strong>.</h3>



<p>Living with a pothead will leave your apartment smelling like burnt rope, and you have to get used to it. It’ll hang on your clean clothes and follow you everywhere. The bright side is some people like the tobacco smell.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>4. The fun doesn’t last</strong>.</h3>



<p>The <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.yourtango.com/201064123/9-pros-and-cons-dating-pothead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interesting stories</a> can get old after a while; if only weed makes them funny, your stoner roommate will stop being amusing and start to get on your nerves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Guidelines to note while living with a Pothead</strong></h2>



<p>Here are some guidelines to note when living with a pothead</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>When you want to host parties, your roommate would not want to be left out.</li><li>When you and your stoner roommate decide to host a party, communication is vital. As a non-smoker, you have friends who do not smoke and will like to be aware of your food choices. You need to communicate to guests, with the invitation and on arrival at your house.</li><li>You talk to them about the food and drinks you provide, whether they contain cannabis/marijuana, how much was incorporated, and the potential effects. Also, consider making food and drinks for non-stoner roommates and guests, so guests can easily make their choices. These are the things you put into consideration when <a href="https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/opinion/unique-complications-living-stoner/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living with a pothead</a>.</li><li>There are moments where living with a pothead will bother you as a non-smoker; this is what you should do: Honesty is the best way to go, but the way you deliver this message will let you know if the discussion will go well. You can ask if they have time to talk about some roommate topics on things that make them uncomfortable. State it simply without being offensive that you aren’t bothered about the smoking, but the frequency that they do it is getting to you. You can suggest that the windows are left open, or they do it outside sometimes. Whatever will make you feel more comfortable and know that there will be counter suggestions, but you have to find a balance that’ll satisfy you both as it is both of your apartment and you both need to be comfortable.</li></ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a narcissist?</h2>



<p>First off, you must understand <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">narcissistic personality disorder</a>. (NPD) It is a legitimate mental health condition that requires diagnosis by a mental health professional. The term narcissist is widely used interchangeably with NPD and this is a misunderstanding. While there are certain hallmark characteristics of NPD, having them does not necessarily mean you have the condition. A person can exhibit some characteristics of NPD and not actually suffer from it. However, if their narcissism is a strong pattern of behavior, they may be diagnosed with NPD. The first analysis you need to make is if your roommate is suffering from NPD or if they show have narcissistic tendencies.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Accept who they are</h3>



<p>When they want to, those with narcissistic personalities are great at charming people. You might find yourself drawn to your narcissist roommate and their show of grandiose. These are also particularly popular in work settings or among their colleagues. When it comes to narcissists, they seem to draw all the attention towards themselves. Do not let all of this carry you away or make you react to them. Understand that these tendencies are just the way they are and, are common for people like them. Do not take their actions or words personally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do not try to change them</h3>



<p>The first step in dealing with your narcissist roommate is simply accepting that you cannot change them. Do not expect them to change, or you will just end up disappointed and frustrated. No matter how rationally you try to explain things, they are unlikely to hear you. Arguing with a narcissist may escalate the situation and trigger their inability to handle criticism. You need to understand that there is nothing that you can do to change a narcissist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do not feed their behavior</h3>



<p>Now that you have understood the tendencies of a narcissist, do not fall prey to them. They can make you feel pressured to push aside your own needs to keep them satisfied. They can be extremely demanding of your attention, praise, and obedience. However, it is essential you show them that they cannot bully you into submission. If you think there will be a break in their attention-seeking behavior, it doesn&#8217;t come. Do not humor a narcissist&#8217;s false reality and delusions. No matter how much you try to adjust your life to suit their needs, it is never enough.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Know yourself!</h3>



<p>Your narcissist roommate does not live in reality. Hence, their views of themselves and other people are wildly delusional. Remember this when a narcissist tries to manipulate, gaslight, or bully you. Don’t let their shame and blame strategy and manipulation undermine your self-esteem. The best defense against the insults and projections of the narcissist is your self-esteem. When you know yourself well, you are able to reject any unfair criticisms leveled against you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Have &#8216;the talk&#8217;</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve gone over the situation and made your assessment, it is time for you to sit them down. Let them know honestly but in a sensitive and friendly way. Put your foot down and don&#8217;t budge if they are being unreasonable. Avoid confronting them in a public space or in front of a large group of people as this can trigger them. They may react aggressively and fight back to save face. Hence, be ready to back off if you feel the situation could escalate. All the best!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let them go</h3>



<p>Maybe you have tried your best to accept who they are and deal with them. However, they still make living absolutely unbearable. This doesn&#8217;t need to be the case. It may be time to cut off your narcissist roommate. There are many fish (potential roommates) in the sea (city.) If they don&#8217;t value you, it could be time to search for a new roommate. Lucky for you, you&#8217;re already in the right place!</p>



<p>Roomi can help you find roommates and find one who is the right living partner for you. Better luck this time. Choose well!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>College life is one of the most transformative periods in a person’s life. I mean, how could it not be? You’re meeting new people, in a new city (maybe even <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/find-room-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a>?!) <em>and</em> you’re away from the comfort of your home! It’s kind of like an adulthood version of throwing yourself into the deep-end of the pool, and waiting to see if you sink or swim. Of course, it’s not all scary. You’ll make lifelong friends, have profound experiences and a whole lot of memories! And one of these profound experiences is the one that involves you living with a stranger. Y’know, your roommate? Your college roommate, conflict and all, will always hold a special meaning for you. And as fun as it is to have someone to share this whole new experience with, roommate problems are bound to arise.</p>



<p>So, today, we thought we’d talk about how to deal with conflicts that arise when you’re living with a college roommate for the very first time. Don’t worry, most problems are fixable if you both have the right tools. And that’s what we’re here to help with!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resolve any conflict with your college roommate with an agreement</h2>



<p>We know agreement sounds like such a formal word. I mean, that’s something you sign when you’re an <em>adult </em>adult and want to buy a New York City penthouse or something. But you’d be surprised by how much this helps. Of course, this document is not legally binding, but that doesn’t mean it’s not effective! Writing down your wants, needs and expectations from your roommate (and vice versa) can really set the right tone for your relationship. Trust us, you’ll feel like you know your new roommate a lot better after reading this agreement. And when conflict inevitably arises with your college roommate, you can just refer back to this agreement. <em>This </em>is how you deal with roommate problems in a healthy way!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communication is key when dealing with college roommate conflict</h2>



<p>We know, confronting a new college roommate might seem like a bad idea. After all, you want to be friends with your roommate, not accuse them of causing problems. But that’s just it, honest communication isn’t confrontation (Of course, if you decide to scream all your problems in their face, it won’t help). But if you (kindly and gently) let your roommate know when they do something you don’t like, they’ll try to accommodate you. They probably didn’t mean to piss you off on purpose.</p>



<p>Not to sound too much like a marriage counselor, but communication really is the key to most of your problems. A conflict with your college roommate will only escalate if you don’t communicate with them. What is a mild annoyance today, <em>will</em> become <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-stress-of-poor-communication-with-others-4154175" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">unbearable</a> when you’re both stressed out about final exams later in the semester. So, nip it in the bud and your dorm room will be a safe haven for both of you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t point fingers at them</h2>



<p>We’re just going to keep the marriage counselor vibe going for just a second longer and give you this one advice: don’t put all the blame on them. When you start pointing fingers at them and blame them for all your problems, they will get <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/love-relationships/words-matter-you-vs-i/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defensive</a>. This is actually advice that doesn’t just help you deal with your roommate problems, but problems with every other person. The moment people get defensive, they start (verbally) attacking back and that just doesn’t lead to anything good. And if your opponent is an 18 year old New York City college student, <em>oh boy</em>. So, maybe you should try telling them how their actions made you feel instead of telling them they’re irritating and a bad roommate. Sensitivity is key when dealing with a conflict with your college roommate!</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://www.sofi.com/blog/pros-cons-of-being-an-ra/#:~:text=A resident assistant or resident,the residents of a dorm.&amp;text=Sharing information about the residence,campus activities%2C and available resources." target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Advisor</a> (or RA) might seem annoying when they’re enforcing “quiet hours” and telling you all the different ways in which you’re breaking University rules. But when it comes to mediating a conflict with your college roommate, they’re godsent. If your roommate problems persist and nothing seems to solve it, it may be time to call in your RA. Shoot them an email, or text (or snapchat, if y’all are cool) and let them know of the situation.</p>



<p>From there you can decide what action to take. Maybe the RA can meet with both of you one-on-one or perhaps a group session might be helpful. Whatever it is, an outside mediation can really put things into perspective.&nbsp; In the rare cases where nothing seems to work and you just can’t live with your roommate anymore, they might even help you switch rooms. Though this is a lot harder to do once the semester is already half-way done.</p>

<p>College life will throw you in a lot of situations that are less than ideal. That includes unpleasant roommates, but don’t let that ruin the whole experience for you. Honestly it actually might be good practice for if you ever move to New York City. Just remember, your roommate is only part of the college experience. And if you just can’t get along with them, there’s always a next semester!</p>

<p>Arrrghhh, doesn&#8217;t it make your blood boil when you find certain items missing from their designated spot? Or your shampoo bottle half-empty, or having to do someone else&#8217;s dishes? No, you&#8217;re not overreacting over roommate issues – it&#8217;s totally normal to sometimes feel annoyed with your roomi. It isn&#8217;t easy to live with someone. But it <em>is</em> easier to try making someone understand what&#8217;s getting on your nerves than to pick a fight!</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how to renegotiate your terms with your annoying roommate instead of pulling your hair out in frustration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-eat-your-food-without-permission">They eat your food without permission</h2>



<p>So, you&#8217;ve been dreaming about that croissant that you left in the fridge before leaving for work. But you come home to find it missing! Turns out your roommate ate it because they were hungry.</p>



<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Get some food first, it&#8217;s never a good idea to confront when you&#8217;re hangry; it just leads to more roommate conflict. Try to have a relaxed conversation later. Tell them that they need to check with you before eating your food so you can plan and get something else ready for a snack/dinner so y&#8217;all can avoid a silly roommate issue.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-annoying-roommate-s-messiness-has-reached-your-living-area">Annoying roommate&#8217;s messiness has reached your living area</h2>



<p>You are meticulous and organized while your roomi is a moving mess. It&#8217;s fine if it&#8217;s in the confines of their room. But they leave their stuff in every room they go. Gosh, someone could even tell what they did the whole day by just tracking their trail of mess!</p>



<p><strong>What to do:</strong> First, try to bring this roommate issue up in the least confrontational way possible. Try to tell them you&#8217;re uncomfortable working in the living area because their mess takes up space and is distracting. If talking it out fails, try giving them a taste of their own medicine; leave dirty dishes in the sink or your stuff on their bed. When they confront you, tell them why you did that and how it affects you when they do the same.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-their-passive-aggression-leads-to-roommate-issues">Their passive-aggression leads to roommate issues  </h2>



<p>Your roommate is awfully silent and doesn&#8217;t participate in fun stuff/conversations like they used to. You can often see their eyes roll back into their head each time you&#8217;re around.</p>



<p><strong>What to do:</strong> Never treat passive-aggressiveness with more passive-aggressiveness. Strike a casual conversation. Walk into the room nonchalantly and ask them – &#8220;Hey I noticed that you&#8217;re not talking properly to me, did I do something to upset you?&#8221; or &#8220;Hey I noticed you&#8217;ve been putting my stuff on the shelf – I&#8217;ll be more mindful of that if that&#8217;s bothering you.&#8221; </p>



<p>If they don&#8217;t want to talk about it (the annoying roommate that they are!) that&#8217;s totally their wish. But your bringing it up will help clear the air a little.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-are-smoking-or-drinking-all-the-freakin-time">They are smoking or drinking all the freakin&#8217; time</h2>



<p>You don&#8217;t mind them smoking or drinking. But when they know your paper is due tomorrow and they&#8217;re planning a party tonight, they&#8217;ve crossed a line.</p>



<p><strong>What to do: </strong>Tell your roommate that you need to work or study, and you don&#8217;t want this to become a roommate conflict. Tell them their lifestyle is affecting not just them but you too. Council them, and let them know you&#8217;re there to talk things through if they&#8217;re going through a difficult time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-are-self-centered-and-inconsiderate">They are self-centered and inconsiderate</h2>



<p>They will do what they want to do; they&#8217;ll watch loud TV, eat your food, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/keep-track-expenses-roommates/1248/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refuse to split the money equally</a>, and continue to deplete your toiletries. You&#8217;ve tried to talk, asked for help, and asked them to be supportive. You&#8217;ve even decided to give them a taste of their own medicine. Yet, they fall back to their old ways.</p>



<p><strong>What to do: </strong>This is the most annoying roommate quality. It&#8217;s best to tell them that you two are not meant to be roomis. And that they should <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/top-5-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-roommate/1383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find a new compatible roommate</a>.

<p>All we want is to&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/">find a good roommate in NYC</a>! Is it too much to ask? In fact, at Roomi, we&#8217;ve been successfully&nbsp;matching New Yorkers with their dream place&nbsp;for years now. But, what if you and your roommate skipping hand-in-hand along Broadway isn&#8217;t a reality? What if you&#8217;re experiencing conflicts and you&#8217;re unsure how to resolve them? Well, it&#8217;s 2020, and that means we can&nbsp;get away with using 2020-type methods of communication. The text message!&nbsp;<a href="https://bearworks.missouristate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4014&amp;context=theses" class="broken_link">Studies suggest that it is better to manage common roommate conflicts through text messages</a>&nbsp;rather than confrontation. Because texting your roomie gives them time to analyze their mistakes and act accordingly. It also gives you enough time to string your thoughts and watch your tone.</p>



<p>So in this article, Roomi will help you resolve common roommate conflicts by showing you how to craft the perfect text!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let&#8217;s look at the most common roommate conflicts!</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#1  Their friends or partner are over too often!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/Uq5d1nsKUShv6Vlomt/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/Uq5d1nsKUShv6Vlomt/giphy.gif"/></figure>



<p>You agreed to live with&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;person, and all of a sudden, it feels like your place is overrun! There&#8217;s their SO, friends, colleagues, classmates, neighbors, and grandma&#8217;s dog! All roommates enjoy others to have guests over, but not ATM. Loud chatting, higher electricity bills, and a bathroom that’s always occupied? If this sounds familiar, grab your phone and text your roomie this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Hey! Are you free to talk about our guest policy in the apartment later? Your [friends/partner] are great, but they&#8217;re over a lot, and I don&#8217;t feel like I get much space at home. I think it would help if we limited the number of times we each have guests over to [x] per week. Is that ok with you?</strong></p></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#2 They don&#8217;t clean up after themselves!</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/WxzhpsnJMV4q6yGvGf/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/WxzhpsnJMV4q6yGvGf/giphy.gif"/></figure></div>



<p>Dealing with a messy roomi takes its toll – no one likes seeing dirty dishes in the sink or overflowing trash cans in the kitchen. This is a common roommate conflict! Remember that two people often have different definitions of what &#8220;mess&#8221; actually is! However, there are basic standards that everyone can and should adhere to. If this is becoming an ongoing issue, text your roomie:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Hey! I don&#8217;t mean to nag, but the apartment has been really messy lately, and I feel like I&#8217;m cleaning up after you often. Those [dishes/frying pans/wine glasses] have been on the counter for a few days, and I can&#8217;t get to the sink to do my own washing up. Would you mind checking up on your mess when you&#8217;re home?</strong></p></blockquote>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/help-my-roommate-is-driving-me-up-the-wall-roomi/">Related: Help! My Roommate is the Most Annoying Person on the Planet!</a></pre>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3 Heating &amp; cooling debates!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/l4FATJpd4LWgeruTK/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FATJpd4LWgeruTK/giphy.gif"/></figure>



<p>You like a cool, comfortable apartment, but your roomi cranks up the heating at any given opportunity. If you feel yourself sweating at home, send a text to come to an agreement before a fight really heats up. Remember that some people feel temperature differently; don&#8217;t assume that everyone shares the same perception as you. Text your roomie:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Hey! I noticed the heating in the apartment keeps getting cranked up really high! I kinda keep sweating whenever I&#8217;m home. Maybe I&#8217;m naturally hotter than you are, but can we agree on a constant temperature? A good standard room temperature is around 70 – maybe we can try that and see if it&#8217;s comfortable for both of us before I melt!</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4 Damages!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/netflix-santa-clarita-diet-67urFpVn7qwcd2gWIl"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/67urFpVn7qwcd2gWIl/giphy.gif?resize=540%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="Drew Barrymore Oops GIF by NETFLIX - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="540" height="540" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>So, they broke a lamp, spilled coffee on the sofa, or scratched the flooring. However, your roomie hasn&#8217;t brought up the mistake with you. The issue here is that damage beyond general wear-and-tear could affect how much deposit you get back. Leaving&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;of you out of pocket. Wait a day or two after noticing the damage, as they may have already made steps to fix the problem. If you hear nothing, text your roomie this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Hey! I noticed [x] is damaged. These things happen, but I just wanted to make sure you&#8217;ve contacted a [cleaner/tradesperson] to get it fixed? Let me know if you haven&#8217;t had a chance, and I&#8217;ll look for someone who can help. I&#8217;ll pass the number onto you as I&#8217;d like to get it fixed as soon as possible to make sure we get our full deposit back when we leave!</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5 They stole your food! (Most common roommate conflict in the history of coliving)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/XECiLxeHvwdD96Jc6Z/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/XECiLxeHvwdD96Jc6Z/giphy.gif"/></figure>



<p>This by far is the most common roommate conflict! When your snacks and leftovers keep going missing, it can be infuriating; we get it! Skip the face-to-face conflict(no one should have to see you get all red-faced over missing cookies). Instead, text your roomie something that&#8217;s straight to the point:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Hey! My [leftover stir fry/chips and salsa] have gone missing, and I wondered if you&#8217;ve taken them by mistake? It&#8217;s cool if you have, I just want to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again because I can&#8217;t afford to buy more groceries each week. I can start labeling my food to avoid us getting confused in the future if that helps.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Roomi advice:</strong>&nbsp;If sending your roomie a text doesn&#8217;t work, a face-to-face conversation should be your next approach. It&#8217;s much easier to build connections and convey emotions when someone can actually see us. Make sure to talk it out with your roomie after addressing things that bother you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So, your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets. You love animals, but you don’t love annoying roommates. Whether your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-late-paying-rent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate is always late paying rent</a> or they don’t take proper care of their cat, dog, budgie or iguana, it’s you who feels the impact. So, if you find yourself regularly cleaning up poop, vacuuming hairs or sharing your chicken legs with hungry pets, how can you stay sane?</p>



<p>An <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deal-roommates-untrained-pet/">untrained pet </a>leads to a messy, smelly house, and if you’ve agreed to let your roommate keep their furry friend in your home, there are certain standards they should adhere to. Remember; their pet isn’t your responsibility. So, follow these tips to make the best of the hairy situation that’s unfolding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-roommate-doesn-t-walk-their-dog-often-enough">Your roommate doesn’t walk their dog often enough</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“[My roommate] has a Maltipoo mix who&#8217;s currently 2 years old. They just moved into the place we&#8217;re currently living at about 5 months ago, and I, nearly 2 months ago. I&#8217;m not sure how she&#8217;s taken care of her dog prior to me moving in, but since I&#8217;ve started residing there, I&#8217;ve never seen her walk her dog. I voiced my opinion on this and suggested that she spend more time with him (even take him to work, as her workplace is dog-friendly). She obliged a couple times (maybe 3 times max since I&#8217;ve lived with her) and has spent maybe half a day to a full day once or twice (again, since I&#8217;ve moved in).</em></p>



<p><em>As far as I&#8217;ve seen, Sarah doesn&#8217;t play with the dog at all but she keeps him in her room with her boyfriend as soon as she comes home until the next morning when she&#8217;s off to work/wherever else.”</em></p>

<p>Your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets, and as annoying as it is for you, it&#8217;s worse for the pets. If, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/597xk5/roommate_neglects_her_dog_what_should_i_do/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit poster butwhythough1</a>, you’re feeling sorry for your roommate’s house-bound doggo, what can you do? You know owning a pet is a decision that’s not to be taken lightly. That dog needs exercise, but you no longer want to resort to walking it yourself. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-do-you-do-when-your-roommate-doesn-t-take-care-of-their-pets">So, what do you do when your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets? </h3>



<p>This sort of case isn’t illegal. Just saying your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets won&#8217;t get you very far. So unless the neglect develops into something more extreme, the NYPD or an animal control agency won’t be able to help. Instead, you’ll have to voice your concerns to your roommate. So, make him/her aware that dogs need to be walked. Provide numbers for local dog walkers if they don’t have the time. Sometimes your annoying roommates only need a guiding hand to see the errors of their ways.</p>



<p>If that’s not an option, a careful conversation should help you determine what is. If they’re struggling to find either the time or money to take care of your pet, it might be time to let go. Speak to them about finding another loving home that can give the animal the life it deserves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-roommate-s-pet-isn-t-potty-trained">Your roommate’s pet isn’t potty-trained</h2>



<p>A cat that can’t use the kitty litter. A dog that doesn’t do its business outside. Doesn&#8217;t that sound like a nightmare to live with? An untrained pet starts to really affect your own quality of life. It’s difficult to turn a blind eye when unpleasant animal scents waft their way into your nose every time you&#8217;re home. But just because your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets, doesn&#8217;t mean you need to live in a stinky apartment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9m917p/my_roommates_dogs_are_driving_me_crazy_i_dont/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit poster readoldbooks</a> had a similar experience:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“My roommate has a 1.5 year old Aussie Shepherd who constantly pees inside the house, EVERYDAY. She is taken outside every morning, around lunch, every evening, but still pees inside as soon as no one is watching her (even if I am home but in another room, she will pee on the house). She does nothing to alert that she needs to go outside. How can we train her?”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your response to this really depends on your own history with animals. If you’re experienced with cats or dogs, you can guide them! You could actively help them train their pet or offer advice. If not, you’ll find training guides and videos online to share with your annoying roommates. Avoid giving in and cleaning up the mess yourself. This will just let your roomi think they’re off-the-hook and they could stop taking responsibility altogether. Bring the pee or poop to their attention immediately. And make sure the pet owner is keeping on top of any potential hygiene issues.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-the-neglect-is-more-serious">What if the neglect is more serious?</h2>



<p>The fact that your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets could be a sign of something much worse. So, if you’re witnessing serious animal abuse, you need to do something about it. If talking things through doesn’t yield the outcome you want, remember that as a cohabitant, you can report neglect. Keep a written diary of everything you experience &#8211; with dates, times and specific details wherever possible. Take photos that show the abuse. For example, take pictures of the pet and where its kept. Then <a href="https://www.aspca.org/take-action/report-animal-cruelty" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">report animal cruelty</a> to the appropriate organization. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We can’t choose our family, but we <em>can </em>choose our roommate. That said, a roommate interview is similar to a first date or a job interview &#8211; we put on our brightest smile and try to give the best possible impression of ourselves. Often, it’s not until the lease has been signed and everyone has settled into their new home that the roommate problems begin to show. Maybe you find yourself stuck with a messy roommate, or maybe you&#8217;re dealing with a roommate who&#8217;s just stone-cold. </p>

<p>Before we get into anything else, here&#8217;s a little something that&#8217;ll tell you what the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-find-a-roommate-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">best way to find a roommate</a> is. But if you’ve already moved in with someone and you just hate being around them, what can you do?</p>



<p>Short of hiding out in your bedroom or moving back in with your parents, let’s check out your options based on some common situations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">They’re a messy roommate</h2>



<p>This is one of the most common roommate problems out there. Does it sound familiar to you?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“So my college dorm roommate is still as messy as ever, which I believe I have been fairly tolerant of. However, her stuff continues to flood into my space, even after I&#8217;ve brought it up to her. I like to think I&#8217;m a direct person, and not a pushover, but I don&#8217;t want to seem pushy and keep asking her to make sure she keeps her stuff in HER space. The worst part is that this wouldn&#8217;t even be a problem if she would just use all of her drawer, cabinet, desk, and closet space. It&#8217;s really driving me mad how inconsiderate she keeps acting.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/a4fuv0/messy_roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit poster ohgirlfitup</a>, you’re struggling to co-exist with a messy roommate and have already brought up the problem, what steps can you take? It’s easy to fall into a deep pit of resentment towards an inconsiderate roommate. But, bottling things up often just leads to an outburst from you (and then things get<em> really </em>messy.) </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>But when talking things through doesn’t lead to the nice, neat outcome you’re hoping for, what do you do?</p>



<p><strong>Here&#8217;s some things you can try-</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Pick your battles.</strong></h3>



<p>We get it; your messy roommate has habits that make your skin itch. But complaining about everything won’t help. When dealing with a roommate, only confront them on bigger issues that truly obstruct your daily life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Assign your own spaces.</strong></h3>



<p>Determine which spaces “belong” to each of you and which are communal. If their stuff crosses into your boundary, you can simply put it back into theirs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Create a cleaning roster.</strong></h3>



<p>Write up a schedule of daily and weekly chores, so you’re splitting the cleaning tasks evenly and you’re not left feeling annoyed because you’re <em>always </em>the one to scrub the bathroom.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Their social life doesn’t match up to yours</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/7bosv7/i_hate_my_roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit user handakun</a>, was sharing a bedroom with someone that rarely left the room and didn’t seem to want to get to know her:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“Let&#8217;s call my roommate Tiffany (not her real name). She and I are both first years and we&#8217;re sharing a dorm room. When I first met her, she seemed really kind and genuine so I didn&#8217;t think much about it. However over time, I realized she doesn&#8217;t go out that much. She&#8217;s almost always in the room either watching videos, talking to her friends or family over the phone, etc. She doesn&#8217;t make any effort to get to know me or any of our hallmates.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If you’re in a similar situation, it’s time to mentally remove yourself and take an objective point-of-view. This is actually one of the better roommate problems to have. Okay; so your messy roommate parties less (or more) than you do. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re wrong for doing so. Everyone is different, and you may just need to set some boundaries between the two of you, or learn to accept that everyone lives their own life. At least, they&#8217;re not a messy roommate! </p>

<p>As long as their lifestyle doesn’t affect your quality of living (e.g. they’re waking you up at crazy times), you can learn to live in harmony. Try taking part in activities together, such as cooking a meal, watching a TV series or inviting them out with your friends.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">They’re generally difficult to live with</h2>



<p>Sometimes, your roommate doesn’t have just one annoying habit &#8211; they have lots! On top of being a messy roommate, they sleep with the light on in your shared room. They blast music you hate. Cook smelly food and then leave a mess. And loudly blending their green smoothie at 6 a.m. there&#8217;s just no end to your roommate problems!</p>



<p>We’ve all been there. Dealing with a messy roommate who pisses you off on every level is really hard. But here&#8217;s how can deal with them better- </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Talk things out within 24 hours of a negative event to set rules and boundaries early on.</li><li>Don’t address problems when you’re already annoyed &#8211; stay cool, calm and collected.</li><li>Start the difficult conversation by apologising for not letting them know [insert roomi issue] annoys you at the beginning.</li><li>Suggest possible solutions or ways to land on some middle ground</li><li>Discuss issues in person, rather than via text messages.</li><li>Start by making a joke about the issue, to see if that fixes things up. Address it delicately and avoid veering towards sarcasm. If that doesn’t work, address it more directly. </li></ul>
