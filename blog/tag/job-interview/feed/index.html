<p>Applying for jobs and doing your best in an interview, and then <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/do-this-while-you-wait-to-hear-from-a-job-interview-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waiting to hear back</a> is taxing as it is. On top of that, if you have to face rejection, it can be disheartening and demotivating. The good news is, it doesn&#8217;t have to feel this way. You can work through the demotivation by rejecting to view job interview rejection as a failure. <strong>Or, as John C. Maxwell has quoted, “Successful people reject rejection.”</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>You might be tempted to think you don&#8217;t have what it takes if your job interview doesn&#8217;t materialize as you were hoping it would. Like your roomis and your friends, we want you to remember that if something doesn&#8217;t work out, you might soon realize that it worked in your favor.</p>



<p>So instead of letting a job interview rejection take a toll on your self-esteem, make rejection your friend and turn it into an opportunity instead.</p>



<p><strong>Here are some things to do when you&#8217;re facing job interview rejection</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Job interview rejection and confused why? Ask for feedback!</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s no point in overthinking and self-analyzing why you were rejected. Because chances are, you will not get the right answer. Instead, you could ask your recruiter or interviewer to tell you what went wrong to be better prepared for your next interview.</p>



<p>If you do receive a bland answer in return, you should push them to give you more details. If another candidate was favored over you, ask them to tell you what you lacked as a candidate. Additionally, explain why you need an answer and how it will help you in your job search.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Job interview rejection 101: It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s probably them</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s clichéd because it is true. If you&#8217;ve performed your best and did all you could to nail that last job interview and still faced rejection, then the company or position was simply not meant for you. That doesn&#8217;t mean you sit and blame the company for not understanding your true potential. Sometimes things don&#8217;t work out &#8211; and it&#8217;s for the best.</p>



<p>Maybe they didn&#8217;t see you as a fit for the environment, or the employer simply didn&#8217;t feel it in their gut to hire you. They&#8217;re human too, after all. And a lot of our decisions &#8211; personal and professional &#8211; largely depend on the way we feel about what our stomachs tell us. So don&#8217;t sweat over it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Work on your skillset</h2>



<p>Review your CV and try to spot any outdated skills that might not have made you the perfect fit. If you realize something lacks in your professional skillset, make this an opportunity to learn something new.</p>



<p>New jobs are being added to the job market rapidly because of technological developments and the pandemic. So you could make use of this interview rejection and sharpen your professional skills instead of feeling bad for yourself.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Apply to places you&#8217;re confident about</h2>



<p>If a headhunter or recruiter has scouted you, you need to put in the research to see if you can adjust to the position they think you fit well. You need to realize that recruiters are just doing their job, and we all know, sometimes we value finishing our work over giving our 100%.</p>



<p>Give them the benefit of the doubt. Thoroughly research the position and the company before spending too much energy on the job interview and the subsequent rejection.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don&#8217;t stop looking!</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t give up on looking for a good opportunity based on your previous job interview rejection. Look at the larger picture and find something you love and pursue that. Maybe it didn&#8217;t work out because better opportunities are on your way.</p>



<p>That said, don&#8217;t just think about it while moping in front of the TV or with your roomi. Instead, start reviewing and planning for a possible career switch (if you often find yourself thinking you need it) or find the organizations that you want to work for and then put in the effort to pursue that.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. What are your best strengths?</h2>



<p>Play the interviewer and ask yourself this question when negativity from a job interview rejection looms. When you feel demotivated, and your self-esteem feels attacked, the best thing to do to recover and push harder is to focus on your strengths. Define your professional as well as personal strengths and note them down. Take help from your roomis, friends, and family. Slowly but surely, you WILL get through this!</p>

<p>So you just had a job interview and you did everything you could. From <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/five-tips-to-spruce-up-your-resume/1516/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sprucing up your resume</a> to making sure you looked your best- you did everything to the best of your abilities. You took the time out to sharpen your professional skills before you even applied for the job. You were prepared for all the interview questions and came across as confident and trustworthy. It ended with &#8216;Thank you, we&#8217;ll get back to you&#8217;. But it&#8217;s been an hour since you left the interview room and patience is running out by the minute. Come night time, and you can&#8217;t sleep thinking about what you should and shouldn&#8217;t have said. </p>



<p>You might feel tempted to get up in the morning and call or email your interviewer asking if you got the job. But you worry if they don&#8217;t reply, you might end up being even more stressed out.</p>

<p>What you need to do, first of all &#8211; is calm down! The truth is, you gave it your all, and your interviewers might be busy. You&#8217;ll probably get that job; remember that it could all take longer than you expected. And of course, we all know &#8216;good things come to those who wait.&#8217;</p>



<p>But if you&#8217;re thinking what the heck you&#8217;re supposed to do while you wait, we&#8217;ve got your worried back.</p>



<p>Read up on our top tips to handle the anxiety and do something productive with your time while you wait to hear back from your job interview.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Don&#8217;t stop looking for the next job interview</h2>



<p>The not-so-easy to accept truth of the matter is, your interviewer might be doing the same thing. They might have a couple of interviews lined up (yes, even after YOU showed up).  And they will come to a decision only when they&#8217;ve gone through all the job interviews with the shortlisted candidates.</p>



<p>Instead of constantly worrying about and praying to hear back, you should keep applying to and exploring other <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job opportunities</a>. If finances are the main worry, you should also look for side hustles to stay safe and get another source of income as soon as you can. This might even distract you from the previous interview since you&#8217;ll be busy looking at other company profiles and preparing for interviews with them. Plus, the more interview questions you answer, the better you get at it!</p>

<p>If you fear your skills might soon be outdated, take this time to<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/sharpen-your-professional-skills-in-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> improve your skills</a>. It&#8217;s never too late to sharpen your professional skills! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. What job interview? Read that fat book. </h2>



<p>While a job is essential to survival, it&#8217;s not the end-all and the only purpose of life. There&#8217;s a vast world out there waiting for you to engage your curiosity. If you&#8217;ve been putting off a great book that you always wanted to read but had no time for when you were working &#8211; NOW is the time!</p>



<p>If you come to like the book, you&#8217;ll easily be distracted from the anxiety of waiting to hear back from the job interview. Apart from killing time, reading a good book will help you transcend into another reality that might have vast knowledge to offer on the way. And maybe, it&#8217;ll help you prepare for interview questions the next time around. </p>



<p>If you need some help, <a href="https://www.hannahbrenchercreative.com/blog/quarantinereadinglist" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here&#8217;s a great list of books</a> you can check out!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Play hard to get</h2>



<p>Okay you&#8217;re done with the job interview and the million different interview questions. Now, it&#8217;s a good idea to send your interviewer an appreciation email for taking out the time to meet you. Just resist the urge to send multiple follow-ups, which can end up annoying your prospective employer.</p>



<p>So it would work best for you if you don&#8217;t email or call them repeatedly or check-in immediately. Play it cool. (even if you aren&#8217;t)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Commence online detective work</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re eagerly waiting to hear back from a job interview, and there&#8217;s nothing else you can focus on, put your time and energy into researching the company. After all, if you are daydreaming about getting a positive reply, you should know how to respond when that call finally comes in.</p>



<p>So after you sigh at your daydreams, be the digital Sherlock Holmes you are and uncover whatever you can about the company: its employees, its products and services, and whatever else you stumble upon. Plus this is a great way to sharpen your professional skills. If your profession is being a world class spy. </p>



<p>This research will help you determine where and how you fit into the company and whether you would indeed be happy if you were to join. </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Meditate</h2>



<p>Calm down your anxious mind with meditation. Whenever you feel tempted to refresh your email app a zillion times or check your phone every minute to see if they&#8217;ve responded, deny yourself the panic-stricken joy. Lie down in a dimly lit area in your house and focus on your breath. Let the thoughts come in and go as they please. Choose not to interact with them. You&#8217;ll find a much-needed sense of calm and sail through with lesser effort that panic requires you to put in. You&#8217;ll also find that meditating helps sharpen your professional skills. It&#8217;s magical!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Interview <strong>question: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Answer: I see myself as a sincere, hardworking professional of society in the coming years.</strong><br><em>Me, in my head: (Sipping on margaritas, on an island far, far away.)</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Why do you want to work for us?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>A: You&#8217;re revolutionizing the industry, and I would love to learn from your work and help you with your mission.</strong><br><em>Me, in my head: (I&#8217;m broke and I need to get paid)</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Out of all the candidates, why should we hire you?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>A: Because I&#8217;m a team player. I&#8217;m a hardworking and self-motivated individual.</strong><br><em>Me, in my head: (I REPEAT, I AM MORE BROKE THAN YOUR OTHER CANDIDATES, AND I NEED MONEY!)</em></p>



<p>Feels familiar?</p>



<p>Now that many of us are be sitting at home, trying to ace the next job interview online, we need to have the answers prepared. Maybe in the real world, you could have expressed more with your body language (your aura and friendliness, your perfect smile, hypnosis, etc.). <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tips-for-online-job-interviews/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">But in the virtual world</a>, your words matter more than ever.</p>



<p>So read on and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-ways-to-ace-your-job-interview-like-a-boss-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">get ahead by preparing the answers</a> to the most common job interview questions:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Common interview question 1: <strong>So, tell me a little about yourself</strong>!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:57%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Lz1vNv25E6SmA" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/thinking-funny-Lz1vNv25E6SmA?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fblog2.roomiapp.com%2F"></iframe>
				</div>

	</div>
	


<p>It always sounds so simple, but when asked at an interview, you always find yourself sitting there with the word &#8216;Umm&#8217; coming out of your mouth like a newborn.</p>



<p>Although some uses are natural, you need to avoid overusing the &#8216;umm&#8217; followed by the recitation of your resume; make yourself look like the professional you are.</p>



<p>The first step is to do your research on the company. Then think about the parts of your experience that could prove to be relevant.</p>



<p>Talk about how you reached your current work position and company, your ambitions when you were in college, and whether they are different now. This is a very common interview question where they seek to hear about your personal life experiences or reasons for gaps in your resume.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Question 2: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6IOlC78q5MHhC" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/the-office-summer-hot-dog-6IOlC78q5MHhC?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term="></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Talk about your long-term goals with the company, what you intend to do while you work for the position offered to you, and how it will be relevant to your future goals. Moreover, be sincere and honest during the interview. If lying on the beach is where you see yourself in 5 years, tell them it would be on a business trip as a reward for the excellent job you would do!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Question 3: Why are you leaving your current job?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/XomTLpclNjd1S" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/L0IU2cW8sFw8V2UIfP?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fblog2.roomiapp.com%2F"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>First things first: If you were let go, it&#8217;s completely OKAY to admit it (especially now, with COVID-19 disrupting job sectors). Mention what didn&#8217;t work out and how you&#8217;ve been working hard to improve.</p>



<p>But if you&#8217;re leaving your current job, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-tips-to-stop-hating-your-job-all-the-time-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">DO NOT shine a negative light on your job</a>, employer, or colleagues. The interviewer is not your colleague or friend. Instead, you could say things like: your ideas and goals do not match with your current company/employer/projects. Don&#8217;t miss the opportunity during a job interview to talk about how you wish to explore new skills and opportunities to develop a more versatile portfolio.</p>



<p>Are you waiting to hear back after an interview? <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/do-this-while-you-wait-to-hear-from-a-job-interview-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here&#8217;s what you can do in the meantime!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Question 4: Why should we hire you?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/4Fh0B2CCaickE" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/4Fh0B2CCaickE?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term="></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Remember that an interview is always a two-way street. So, list down your positive attributes that would benefit your employer. Then tell them about how YOU would benefit from the position.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Question 5: What are your strengths and weaknesses?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/egSqD74685gzK" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/egSqD74685gzK?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fingilizce.org%2F"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>To tackle this trick question, frame your answer in a way that does not oversell or undersell your qualities as an employee.</p>



<p>Think of a quality that you honestly consider to be your <strong>weakness</strong> and add how you&#8217;re working to improve the said weakness.</p>



<p>Similarly, when it comes to your <strong>strengths</strong>, do not try to oversell. Think of something that caters to the needs of the position. Also, support your answers to tricky job interview questions with relevant and brief examples.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Question 6: Do you have any questions for me?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:100%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/d1E1YlkOTe4IfdNC" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/latenightseth-question-seth-meyers-d1E1YlkOTe4IfdNC?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fpwcs.instructure.com%2Fcourses%2F176740%2Fdiscussion_topics%2F1780105"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>This is an opportunity for you to investigate. Don&#8217;t let it go. Moreover, this is a common interview question they expect an answer for although it may seem otherwise!</p>



<p>No matter how badly you want a job, you need to protect yourself from toxic work environments, abusive employers, and work hours. So make a good list of things you would like to know and ask the most important ones. Some of them could be about their work hours, their office culture, and how a typical workday might look for you when you start.</p>



<p>You can enquire about the position – whether it&#8217;s a new one; and, if it&#8217;s an old position, where did the previous employee move to, etc. You could also ask the interviewer how long they&#8217;ve worked there and their favorite thing about their work. </p>



<p>And to end it with a hint of vengeance, ask them where they see the company in the next few years! Be ready with your own job interview questions <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The thought of a job&nbsp;interview&nbsp;can be quite nerve-wracking and frightening. It starts with &#8220;Oh, gosh! I hope they don&#8217;t see that long career break on my resume.&#8221; Additionally, &#8220;Jeez, I hope my GPA is good enough for them.&#8221; is often another scary thought. Scores and work history do matter in a job interview; perhaps you scored less or took a long career sabbatical.  </p>



<p>However, the bright side is that you are one of the few candidates who got selected!  Next step: dazzle your interviewer&nbsp;with talent, wit, and honesty.  </p>



<p>Pandemic job hunting got you down? Here are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">6 Must-Have Skills For Individuals Seeking Remote Jobs In 2021</a>.</p>



<p>Read on for Roomi&#8217;s guide to nail your&nbsp;job interview&nbsp;and leave a lasting impression:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip #1: Do your homework for the job interview!</h2>



<p>To ace this job interview and excel in your career, you must research and learn more about the company. Think of accomplishments, goals, mission, values, and culture. Doing research will give you great insight into how you must present yourself professionally. </p>



<p>Study the job description to know how your roles and responsibilities align your career experience and qualifications according to that. You can easily discuss relevant topics in the job interview and shine bright like a diamond!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip #2: Study your resume before your job interview!</h2>



<p>Pretty obvious, huh? The truth is, interviewers often read up on your resume before a job interview and scrutinize every detail to ask you career questions based on it. Here is an example:<br><strong>Interviewer:</strong> &#8220;You finished your course in September 2010 and started a job the very same month. That was a quick career turnaround! Tell us more about that.<br><strong>Interviewee: </strong><em>Thinks hard about their career </em>trajectory &#8211; Where was I working in 2010, and what year is it now?<br><strong>AWKWARD!</strong></p>



<p>In case you are as absent-minded as the person writing this blog, we understand your struggle. The key here is to be thorough with your resume. Prior to your job interview, memorize the date and year of each of your career roles. Knowing exact details will save you from any embarrassment and help you stay ahead of the game.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip #3: Do a mock job interview</h2>



<p>For a mock job interview, you will need &#8211; a table, a few files (fake ones will do!) and a willing Roomi. Ask your roomi to pretend to be an interviewer and shoot some serious questions your way. </p>



<p>Traditionally, a mock interview should help you strike a confident stride and help you practice and perfect your answers. During the job interview practice, your roomi can also choose to give you ratings based on how genuine your answers sound. Win-win!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip #4: Dress for career success!</h2>



<p>First impressions at a job interview can last forever for your career.  It is thus important make sure you don&#8217;t walk into your future company for a job interview wearing bulky headphones and joggers. Talk about a career faux pas!</p>



<p>For instance, choose a business casual look even if your company has a casual dress policy. You can never go wrong with formal attire in a job interview. </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip #5: The correct body language for your job interview</h2>



<p>So you have some wait time before the interviewer summons you &#8211; don&#8217;t use this time to slouch and play games on your phone. </p>



<p>Instead, sit up straight with hands neatly folded in your lap. Try not to fidget or tear your hangnails! Finally, don&#8217;t forget to smile with everyone you interact with. Always maintain eye contact with your interviewer, a soft eye contact &#8211; try not to be creepy. Lol!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Basic interview dos and don&#8217;ts</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do: Eat a light breakfast</strong></h3>



<p>Try to avoid anything that can make you &#8216;gassy&#8217;. Boy, you don&#8217;t want to be breaking the ice and the wind together at your job interview.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do: Prepare questions for your interviewer.</strong></h3>



<p>These could include questions about your role, mistakes made by employees in the same and how they can be avoided or new upcoming projects for the company</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don&#8217;t ever: </strong>Talk about previous employees or company in a negative light.</h3>



<p>Instead, talk about your learning and positive experiences.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do: Take comfortable pauses</strong>.</h3>



<p>Feel free to pause to answer tricky questions. Better a thoughtful response than a nervous one!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do: Follow up</strong>.</h3>



<p>Make sure to check in with your interviewer or HR in 3 &#8211; 4 days.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don&#8217;t: Discuss the details of your salary package (yet).</strong></h3>



<p>Politely ask for time to consider it &#8211; get back to them by the evening or the next morning.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do: Prepare commonly asked questions</strong>.</h3>



<p>Think about your strengths and weaknesses. Where do you see yourself in the next 5/10 years; why should they hire you?</p>



<p><strong>In conclusion, remember that your interviewers are people too! </strong>They understand that life and career have ups and downs. Perfection is utopian, and humbleness is truly all that matters in the end. No matter how intimidating they may look, be yourself and carry yourself with confidence. </p>



<p>All the best and break a leg! (metaphorically of course)</p>
