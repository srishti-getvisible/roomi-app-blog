<p>Finding an apartment with no brokers&#8217; fee in New York City? It&#8217;s absolutely possible.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>



<p>Finding an apartment in New York City can be a daunting task, especially with the added stress of high broker fees. But what if there was a way to avoid those fees and find your dream apartment without breaking the bank? That’s where no-fee apartments come in.</p>



<p>In recent years, the availability of no-fee apartments in NYC has been on the rise, offering hope to renters on a budget. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore everything you need to know about no-fee apartments in New York for 2024 what ‘Broker’s Fee’ is, and where you can find yourself an apartment in New York that doesn’t require one.</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-find-cheap-apartments-in-new-york-manhattan-edition/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">How To Find Cheap Apartments in New York? Manhattan Edition!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-a-broker-s-fee">What&#8217;s a Broker&#8217;s Fee?</h2>



<p>In general, a broker&#8217;s fee is the fee you pay someone to help you find a house in one area. Think of the broker as a middleman between your landlord, the house that you’re renting, and you. Brokers are consulted because they know the areas they represent and can help match both parties at the best price.</p>



<p>However, brokers shouldn’t be confused with real estate agents, as they work in partnership with real estate agencies as well.</p>



<p>There was an attempt to ban broker&#8217;s fees in 2020, but the decision was reversed a mere few weeks later. Nowadays, broker&#8217;s fees cost between 10% to 15% of the annual lease amount according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-10/nyc-rents-are-outrageous-and-that-s-before-the-broker-s-fee" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Bloomberg</a>. And since the rent in NYC is so expensive, a few hundred dollars could easily get added to an already high rent price.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-you-really-need-a-broker"><strong>Do You Really Need a Broker?</strong></h3>



<p>Brokers are still hired for their service because they also help smoothen the process of renting an apartment in New York City.</p>



<p>While tons of websites can help you find a no-fee apartment in New York, you still need to be mindful of the entire process. This is to ensure that you do not miss out on any of the important paperwork that is required for an individual to rent an apartment in New York. When we say mindful, we mean:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Have your <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">W2s and tax returns</a> handy.</li>



<li>Investigate your potential landlord and apartment building thoroughly.</li>



<li>Never hand over cash before you’ve met the landlord,&nbsp;visited the apartment in person, and done enough research to feel comfortable!</li>
</ul>

<p>One of our favorite Valentine’s Day ideas in NYC is to take a fun class! This is an especially fun way to spend the day irrespective of who you’re spending it with. There are several Valentine’s Day events in NYC in this category. If you’re a foodie, you can take a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.murrayscheese.com/classes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheese-making</a> class or pizza workshop. If you’re looking for something artsier, you can learn pottery or even graffiti! Whichever you choose, you’re sure to have a lot of fun. With the current COVID-19 situation, you can even find virtual classes.</p>

<p>Although Valentine’s Day falls on a Monday this year, there’s one way you can enjoy some downtime to celebrate: booking a spa! You can book an appointment in the evening if you’re working. But if you decide to take the day off to spend it with your partner, booking a day spa for a couple’s massage is one of the most romantic things to do in NYC on Valentine’s Day. <a href="https://www.thecouplespa.com/services" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Couple Spa</a> has great packages you can choose from!</p>

<p>A lovely way to celebrate Valentine’s Day in NYC is to book one of the dinner cruises specially planned for this holiday. Enjoy the lovely buffet on this romantic cruise as you watch the captivating skyline of the city all lit up. The cruise, organized by <a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/New-York-City/Bateaux-New-York-Dinner-Cruise/d687-5042NYCBAT" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Bateaux New York</a> offers tickets starting at $208. The cruise itself takes about three hours from beginning to end. So if you have other activities planned for the rest of your evening, you might want to schedule them for later!</p>

<p>Not to be confused with the Fulton Grand, Fulton Ale House is one of the well-loved sports bars in Bed-Stuy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Aah yes, we’ve come around to asking this age old question again: should you get an Uber or a taxi to get around NYC? Uber has taken over all major cities around the world, including NYC. So, it’s no surprise that that might be the go-to for most youngsters in the city. But there&#8217;s just something so iconic about the NYC yellow taxi cab. I mean, you can’t really picture the city without thinking of those yellow cabs driving all over NYC. It’s practically the soul of the city. But as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-subway-crime.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Uber</a> has taken over the city in the past few years, we’ve all found ourselves asking- which option is better? And more importantly, which one is cheaper?</p>



<p>Whether you’ve just <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-perks-of-co-living-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> to NYC and genuinely want to know or just bored at home with nothing else to do, we’ve got all the info you need! So without any further ado, here’s our comprehensive guide traveling around NYC: Cab addition!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nyc-taxi-or-uber-which-is-better">NYC Taxi or Uber: Which is better?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-an-uber-better-than-a-taxi-in-nyc">Is an Uber better than a Taxi in NYC?</h3>



<p>We don’t need to explain to you what uber is, you’ve probably already used it a hundred times. But even if you haven’t they’re actually not that different from a regular taxi. In fact, they’re pretty similar to a yellow taxi cab in how they calculate fares. It’s a combination of the time and distance with an additional fare of any tolls added at the&nbsp; end.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-ll-need-a-phone">You’ll need a phone!</h3>



<p>But of course, the big difference is, you need a working smartphone and an internet connection to book yourself an Uber. So, if you ever find yourself with a dead phone in NYC, uber is not an option for you. Unless, of course, you want to endure the humiliation of going up to a total stranger and asking to use their phone (which, just FYI, is a terrible choice in NYC).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rating-system-ftw">Rating system FTW!</h3>



<p>But there’s a lot of ways in which Uber proves itself to be very useful. First of all, you get to check the rating of the Driver (and they get to see yours as well). If they’ve got a good rating, you can get in the Uber without much stress. You can even share your ride with a friend to be even more cautious.</p>



<p>Uber is also extremely proactive about getting <a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/how-to-contact-support?_csid=tftARz7iRs3LbSqoWjt0Cg&amp;nodeId=4c69afef-5739-4842-9e98-ed0087b873db&amp;state=kjQb7yU1l8Giz_5UZEvEVLc2sdpdNSn6EO12tCipZ4M%3D" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">feedback</a> from the customer. So, if you have a bad experience, you can report it instantly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-availability">Availability!</h3>



<p>Uber is especially useful if you find yourselves in the Suburbs of NYC. Because, while taxi cabs are abundant in the city, you’ll have a real hard time flagging one down once you’re out in the suburbs.</p>



<p>So, now that you’ve got a pretty well-rounded understanding of getting an Uber in NYC, let’s move onto yellow taxis!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-a-taxi-better-than-uber-in-nyc">Is a Taxi better than Uber in NYC?</h3>



<p>Oh what can we say about the New York yellow taxi cab that hasn’t been said before? I mean, it’s an indispensable part of the NYC experience. Just watch any of the thousand movies set in NYC, and we’re sure you’ll find at least a dozen taxis in all the outdoor shots. Yeah, it’s an integral part of the city. But of course, times have changed and perhaps, the taxi might be one of those things that will slowly fade away. After all, aren’t all these new transportation apps supposed to be cheaper anyway?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-actually-cheaper">It’s actually cheaper!</h3>



<p>You’d think that but, surprisingly no, a taxi cab is still cheaper than an Uber in NYC. To be precise, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03021" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> from the University of Cambridge has found that a taxi cab is generally cheaper for shorter trips. Once a trip costs more than $35, then an Uber is likely going to be cheaper for you. But even then, it’s a toss up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-readily-available">Readily Available</h3>



<p>Yellow taxi cabs are everywhere in NYC. Honestly, just wave once as you’re standing at the curb and you’ll find like 10 taxis. Of course, be prepared to be yelled at if flag down a taxi around for no reason in NYC. You don’t need a smartphone or an internet connection to get a taxi, one flailing arm will do. So, if you’re in the City and in need of a cab immediately, a yellow taxi wins hands down!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-customer-service-and-feedback">Customer service and feedback</h3>



<p>It’s not unheard of to have a bad experience with your cab driver. But the procedure to report such an incident is not as instant as it is with Uber. For starters, The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission mandates that all taxis have a passenger bill of rights inside the cab that drivers and cab owners must adhere to. If you want to file an official complaint, you need to dial 311 or go online and report the incident through this <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/filing-complaint-with-tlc.page" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">form</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-who-wins-the-uber-vs-taxi-debate-in-nyc">So, who wins the Uber vs. Taxi debate in NYC?</h2>



<p>Well, both an Uber and a Taxi have their pros and cons in NYC. Of course, team Roomi will always suggest the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains/">subway</a> if you’re in NYC. But we understand that many people aren’t yet comfortable taking the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-subway-crime.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">subway</a> because of the pandemic. But if a cab is your only option, we recommend going with an NYC yellow taxi. It’s cheaper, easily available and honestly, it’s an integral part of living in NYC that you must enjoy at least once!</p>

Rentals are a great alternative to traditional hotels, especially if you’re <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/hacks-to-help-you-find-the-perfect-apartment-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking to rent an apartment</a> on a monthly basis in NYC. While short term rentals are more expensive than regular apartments, they are a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/7-reasons-try-short-term-rental-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great option</a> for many people. Whether you’re renovating your home or just a tourist in New York for a month, short term rentals might be just the thing you’re looking for. So, if you’re somebody in the market looking for a short term rental, here’s what you need to look out for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do your research on the neighborhood before you sign the lease for your short term rental</h2>



<p>Yes, we know, you’re not going to be living there for long, but knowing your neighborhood is a very good idea. There are many <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/finding-no-fee-apartments-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">areas in New York</a>, where renting short term apartments would be an unsafe choice. If it is an option, walk around the neighborhood once or twice to really get to know the vibe of the place. See what your potential neighbors are like. Trust us, it’s very easy to get stuck with terrible short term rentals if you’re unfamiliar with the city. Of course, this research becomes more difficult if you’re from out of town. In that case, do all your research online. See what other people have said about the neighborhood. The subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">AskNYC</a>, can be a fantastic resource for you. Ask any questions you have and we’re sure some good NYC samaritans will help you out.</p>

But alas, our budgets bring us back down to earth and force us to be realistic. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/hacks-to-help-you-find-the-perfect-apartment-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apartment rentals in NYC</a>, especially if it’s on a monthly basis, are really expensive. So here’s where you really need to sit down and ask yourself what it is that you really want. Yes, a Central Park facing apartment is really nice, but do you really need it? Similarly, if you’re looking for short term apartments in New York for 3 or 4 months, it might be smart to invest in one that is fully furnished. Only you know the specifics of your situation, so make sure you do a cost/benefit analysis before signing anything.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure you know the legalities before looking at short term rentals</h2>



<p>As short term vacation homes have become more <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomis-year-in-review-what-the-2020-room-rental-market-looked-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular</a>, there has been some serious backlash from residents. Especially in New York where several communities have passed ordinances that regulate short term rentals. So, for example, you have to lease apartment rentals in NYC on at least a monthly basis, not less than that. Make sure you know the rules and regulations of the building beforehand or may end up paying for it, literally. All of this confusion around regulations has led to an increase in <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/nyc-rental-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scams</a>, and you really don’t want to get sucked into any of that. So, if you’re looking for short term apartments in New York, make sure you are fully informed about the legal aspect of renting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Right place, right time</h2>



<p>As you may already know, New York City is one of the most expensive places to live in the world. Which means that short term rentals are going to be even more expensive than regular apartments. But the thing is, you might actually get a very good deal depending on what time of year it is. So, for example, during peak tourist season, the rent for short term apartments in New York are going to skyrocket. You may even find it hard to find an apartment in the neighborhood you want. In this case, you will really have to make compromises and make the best of the situation. But if you can time your trip right, you might just find a great apartment at a great price. So, you might want to factor that in if you’re looking for apartment rentals in NYC on a monthly basis!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are enough and more things in this world that can make a New Yorker sob. This statement is especially true when it comes to the city&#8217;s (not so) beloved public transit system, the Subway! The subway in NYC is famous for a lot of things, one of our top favorites being that one time <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nnRC6jDOCI" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hozier performed a few songs for commuters at the Rockefeller Center subway stop in NYC</a></strong> (Yep, just like that!). The New York City Subway Station has the most number of stations in the WORLD. In pre-corona days this would amount to overcrowding, delays, and service changes, the kind of barely-controlled chaos in a train in NYC. And overwhelm even the most seasoned city dwellers.</p>



<p>Here are some hacks that can help prepare you for the subway train in NYC to navigate the system better!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much is a subway ride in NYC?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/806743be-14af-4e3d-9324-be29b289b108/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="22 Street Station at Downtown and Brooklyn"/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Riding the subway costs $2.75 for most riders.</strong></h3>



<p>People with disabilities or who are 65 or older are eligible for a reduced fare.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An unlimited rides&#8217; MetroCard can save you money.</strong></h3>



<p>These give you unlimited swipes for a certain length of time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MetroCards cost $1.</strong></h3>



<p>All cards except for the Single Ride card are refillable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Up to three children under 44 inches tall ride for free!</strong></h3>



<p>This is applicable when they’re with a fare-paying adult.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You pay the fare at turnstiles before you board the train.</strong></h3>



<p>You don’t have to do anything after.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Now with services up and running again, the NYC subway demands a $50 fine from riders who refuse to wear a mask. Additionally, they are also offering free masks to anyone who needs them. The only time the subway in NYC is suspended is from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m., while they disinfect stations and trains.</p><cite>&nbsp;<a href="https://new.mta.info/coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York City Subway.</a></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do not ignore the maps and the apps and navigate better on the subway in NYC!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e05791dc-030f-4ffa-b9c1-a9e24ede0df5/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="passengers on the subway seated"/></figure>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing worse than getting caught in a situation you could&#8217;ve easily avoided, mid-transit. Here are some apps you need if you&#8217;re planning on frequenting the NYC subway:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/exit-strategy-nyc-subway-map/id320946370?mt=8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exit Strategy</a></h3>



<p>If like most New Yorkers you’re really in a rush, this app tells you where to best board and off the train! We love anything that helps us save time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nyc-subway-24-hour-kickmap/id285668269?mt=8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KickMap</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps-real-time-navigation/id585027354?mt=8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Maps</a></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for help with directions, plus transit alerts if there are service changes, KickMaps and Google Maps do the job perfectly well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Look for that black &amp; white board, and the conductor at the subway train in NYC!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/67e80289-9108-4736-adef-18a3784d1d4d/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="a subway platform with passengers waiting"/></figure>



<p>If you find yourself in a fix that you doubt an app can solve, just place yourself under one of those black-and-white boards that hang over the middle of the platform. Why you may ask? Because conductors use these boards to make sure the train is aligned properly in the station, and their cars always stop in front of them, so you’ll be ready to ask a quick question before the train has to move on. Pretty neat trick, right?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is it safe to ride the subway at night? And other safety concerns.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6dfdd6a7-397d-439e-9074-ed0c9a9a090b/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="a subway train in NYC headed towards the World Trade Center"/></figure>



<p>Generally speaking, the subway is a much safer place than it used to be a couple of decades ago. But there&#8217;s little reassurance in that statement. Here are some things you can do to ensure your safety on the subway and beyond it!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/riding_the_subway.shtml" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">The NYPD advises riders to:</a></h3>



<p>Make use of a station&#8217;s off-hours waiting area. This may vary from station to station but is typically next to the station agent&#8217;s booth. And if you&#8217;re traveling late at night, it&#8217;s best to ride in the conductor&#8217;s car.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">There will be times when you should avoid the subway entirely.</h3>



<p>In which case, rideshare services like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uber.com/in/en/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Uber</a>&nbsp;are a relatively affordable alternative. And for women and gender-nonconforming people,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nycservice.org/organizations/index.php?org_id=1113" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">RightRides</a>&nbsp;is a non-profit organization that provides free, late-night rides home to ensure safety.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When you&#8217;re anxious or uncomfortable on the subway,</h3>



<p>Move away from someone who is crowding you, keep your bags zipped and phones out of sight. Staying alert is the least you can do.</p>



<p>Another aspect of self-protection involves keeping an eye on your fellow passengers’ behavior and body language. Stay aware of your surroundings. For some people, this might mean losing their headphones. And if someone strikes you as erratic or threatening, try to move to a different car, or simply get off the train.</p>



<p>Many subway stations now have&nbsp;<a href="http://web.mta.info/innov-hp.htm" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">&#8220;Help Points,&#8221;</a>&nbsp;which allow passengers to call in case of emergencies and ask for help.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains-part-2-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Traveling with NYC’s Transit System: Part 2</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding the empty train car is in YOUR best interest.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/f374116e-c2af-4012-bbcd-50500b594c8c/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="a train in NYC at the subway station platform arriving for passengers"/></figure>



<p>Just think about it. Everyone on the train left that one car empty for a reason. The AC may be broken and the air inside might be blisteringly hot. Or maybe someone threw up on it the night before while coming home from a party.&nbsp;If all the other train cars are full and that one is empty, trust the judgment of your fellow New Yorkers and steer clear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So, your hard work has finally paid off- you’re going to be living in New York in the fall! Your dream of studying in the Big Apple has come true! We’re sure it wasn’t easy, but you did it! Student life in NYC is a magical experience- we can only imagine what getting that acceptance letter felt like! But as exciting as all of this is, there’s probably something else on your mind as well. Something that’s a bit more troubling- the cost of living in NYC as an international student. It is after all one of the most <a href="https://www.timeout.com/news/revealed-the-most-expensive-cities-in-the-world-right-now-112520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive cities </a>in the world to live in. Well, don’t you worry because Roomi can be your very own personal New York guide!</p>

<p>We know the idea of living in a foreign country for the first time can be very daunting. So, to make the transition a little easier for you, we’ve broken down all the costs that you should expect to encounter when you come to live in the city. So, let’s dive right in, shall we?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the cost of living in NYC for an international student?</h2>



<p>It’s no secret that the cost of living in NYC is extremely high. I mean, there’s enough jokes about it already. So, we’ll spare you the trite remarks. But, don’t worry, there is some good news here. If you’re a student living in New York, things will probably be relatively cheaper for you. <em>Relatively</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Remember, international students in NYC have to pay a set minimum cost of attendance (CoA)</strong>. Different schools can have wildly different CoAs, depending on your course and whether it’s a public or a private university. You need to prove that you can at least cover the CoA amount to secure your visa. But this is just the minimum cost of attendance, you will have to prepare for other costs as well.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of concessions available for students all over the city that you can take advantage of. And as your New York guide, we’ll get to that in a minute. But before we do, let’s take a second to look at the basic costs that you need to be prepared for before you begin your life in NYC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Want to find roommates and ways to save up on costs as an international student? We&#8217;ve got your back!</h3>

<p>To make it easier, here are the average costs that a student will encounter while living in NYC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Average cost of living for students in NYC</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Particulars</td><td>Average Cost </td></tr><tr><td>Rent</td><td><a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/New-York" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3,089.42/ month</a></td></tr><tr><td>Travelling</td><td><a href="https://new.mta.info/fares#30day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$127/ month</a></td></tr><tr><td>Food</td><td><a href="https://livingwage.mit.edu/states/36" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3,477/ month</a></td></tr><tr><td>Utilities</td><td>$63.59/ month</td></tr><tr><td>Health Insurance</td><td><a href="https://www.internationalstudentinsurance.com/explained/international-student-health-insurance.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100/ month</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Yes, we know it’s a bit steep. But these are just an average of all the costs. If you budget correctly, you will be paying much lower than the above mentioned costs. Lucky for you, there are quite a ways to save money while living in New York. So, read on!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to afford living in NYC?</h2>



<p>Now that you have a fair idea of all the different costs of living in NYC, we can show you how you can afford them!</p>



<p>For starters, if you have the option, choose on-campus housing! It is the easiest way to save money on lodging. Think about it- you won’t have to worry about furniture, or monthly rent or even utilities! As a student, you only need to pay the housing fees at the beginning of the year, and then you can pretty much forget about it!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>And it’s not just that! By living on-campus, you save on food as well! Colleges and Universities have meal plan options for its students that cost a fraction of what meals would cost otherwise! Not to mention, living on-campus is an experience unto itself and you really shouldn’t miss out on it. Roomi recommends trying it out at least once in your college life, even if you can afford the alternative!</p>



<p>If living on campus is not an option, check out this <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/a-first-time-renters-brilliant-guide-to-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">helpful guide</a> for first-time renters in NYC!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to live life to the fullest in NYC!</h2>



<p>Well, now that the boring technical part is over, we can concentrate on the fun part of living in New York! As your New York guide, it is our duty to tell you all the fun things you can do in the city <em>for free</em>!</p>



<p>This list about living in NYC wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the Museum of Modern Art. Admission is free for all visitors on Friday evenings from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. And on other days students get a discount as well! While we’re on the topic of museums, you also need to check out The Metropolitan Museum of Art! For New York State residents and NY, NJ, and CT students, the amount you pay is up to you! (So, basically, free!).</p>



<p>You can also take the Staten Island ferry (for free), have a picnic in Central Park, explore Chelsea Market, wander around the Brooklyn Botanical garden and SO MUCH MORE!</p>

<p>Yep, take our word for that one!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learn the stations you frequent</h2>

<p>At the end of a long commute, you just want to get the hell away from the subway. But it&#8217;s worth taking a second look around to familiarise yourself with the stations you visit frequently. This becomes crucial on the C and G lines as trains don&#8217;t always extend for the full length of the track.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just so rewarding to be able to calculate the train door closest to the exit, from the station you enter! This could make all the difference in your mood as well as your transit time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be very (very) mindful of what you eat (or drink).</h2>

<p>There may be train systems that don&#8217;t let you finish your bagel. But New Yorkers don&#8217;t stand by that kind of thinking. The cops will NOT be called on you if you decide to finish your coffee or sandwich mid-transit.</p>



<p>However, your odds of becoming a viral sensation increase, along with the olfactory intensity. So try to avoid chowing down on anything too strong in order to spare your fellow commuters. (This also goes for food that will make the subway messier than it already is.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep moving! <em>especially when you leave a station.</em></h2>

<p>This cannot be repeated enough. When you exit a station, walk some steps forward, <em>even if you don&#8217;t know where you are.</em></p>



<p>This will prevent you from coming in other people&#8217;s way. And also from people walking directly into your back. Or worse, causing a traffic jam of people, just because you stopped walking when you shouldn&#8217;t have.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like high school hallways, where getting your bearings is important, sure. But don’t jam up the works by not getting the hell out of the way, y&#8217;know?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Common-sense etiquette is expected.</h2>

<p>Remember, the subway is both cramped and responsible for accommodating a lot of people. So the best you can do is make the ride easier for yourself and those traveling next to you. Here are some basic subway etiquettes that we think every passenger must adhere to:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Stand to the side to let people off the trains</li><li>Avoid filling seats around you with your stuff or your smelly sense of entitlement</li><li>Walk all the way into the train instead of stopping six inches after walking through the doors.</li><li>No one likes that person who chooses to play their music on loud or to have a conversation on speaker. Sure, it makes for entertainment, but not at 7 am. </li><li>If you find yourself standing against the doors on a train that&#8217;s filled:<ul><li>Give space to those moving in and out when the doors are open.</li><li>If there&#8217;s space, move to the middle of the train.It&#8217;s as easy as that!</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to understand that just because you&#8217;re adhering to these rules, everyone else will too. The truth, as many exhausted New Yorkers will tell you, <strong>the subway has no rules beyond the New York City Criminal Code.</strong> But a little spatial awareness never hurt anyone.?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get a bike if nothing else works.</h2>



<p>Before you take us up on this, we&#8217;d like to say that <em>everything</em> is a little dangerous to a certain degree. There are even some coyotes running around like they own the place!</p>



<p>So <em>be careful</em> but don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that riding a bike is &#8220;too dangerous&#8221;. (Especially since the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjMnKLP9fPtAhU67HMBHT0xCZUQFjABegQIDhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F07%2F03%2Fnyregion%2Fcoronavirus-nyc-bike-paths.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw1saoQ3xoeIJr4HGsRn9wdS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">city continues to adopt a more bike-friendly infrastructur</a>e across the five boroughs!)</p>

<p>Commuting NYC, like a pro, is no big deal. Truly. Sure it seems intimidating at first, given the sheer vastness of the city. But don&#8217;t worry, We&#8217;ve got a guide on NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains to help you hop around the city in no time!</p>

<p>Those who appreciate sanity often end up resorting to the mass transit in NYC, specifically, the subways and the busses.</p>



<p>Sure, pieces of the former may be falling from the ceiling, and speeds for the latter may be slowing. But if there&#8217;s anything NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains has going for itself is that it&#8217;s cheap, open 24/7, and covers all five boroughs. Yep, Staten Island included.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a visitor or not, you may want some advice on NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains. And we&#8217;re here to provide! Keep reading!</p>

<p>The first thing anyone will tell you about the subway is to plan ahead. Subway delays are a part of the New Yorker&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>All we want to let you know about this is &#8211; never trust anything Google Maps tells you about your ETA. Leave early, always. 15 mins, an hour? Whatever makes you comfortable to get somewhere, if reaching on time is key. Reaching early is always better than getting stuck on the subway — everyone dreads making that excuse.</p>

<p>In the year 2018, the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.mta.mymta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MTA finally released their app</a> — this app is meant to cover NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains, bus, and commuter rail services. You don&#8217;t just save your frequent trips and look for subway stops and bus stations near you. You also get updates on service and delays, and find an array of helpful maps for trains and busses!</p>



<p>Another alternative to this app is <a href="https://transitapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transit</a> — if at all your MTA beta app lags or is too chunky.</p>



<p>You might also need another <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mta.mobileapp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-Tix app</a> to purchase tickets virtually for the Long Island Rail Road. The MTA&#8217;s contactless payment system, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://omny.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OMNY</a>, doesn&#8217;t have its own app yet, but, you can use your digital wallet on your smartphone to very conveniently tap and go.</p>

<p>This one depends completely on your daily route. You might find that you&#8217;re more comfortable with an unlimited MetroCard, which comes in two variants:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>A 30-day MetroCard for $127</li><li>A 7-day for $33</li></ol>



<p>But before you decide on a solid option, give yourself time to understand what exactly your subway needs are like. You might just find that certain routes are easier if walked or biked!</p>



<p>You just might find that you can walk or bike everywhere (especially since a one-year Citi Bike membership is just $169). In this case, buy an occasional $40 MetroCard, or get a 7-day card if you’re entertaining a visitor who you’ll be riding around with all week.</p>



<p>If you do decide to get an unlimited card, make sure to swipe it forward. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/can-i-get-swipe-can-we-get-trouble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More on this very curious subject here.</a></p>

<p>Imagine running to NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains when you know you&#8217;re late, hearing it pull in as you&#8217;re swiping your card. And then realizing you don&#8217;t have any remaining balance on your MetroCard. It&#8217;ll always work in your favor to pay attention to how much is left <em>when you&#8217;re swiping in.</em></p>



<p>The moment you&#8217;re under $2.75, just fill the card up again at the station when you exit. This will help you avoid finding yourself stuck behind a family of tourists. And then watch them trying to figure out the MetroCard system, as the train arrival time teases you into panic mode. ?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The New York City Ferry System, which started its ferrying in 2017, connects <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/new-york-guide-the-five-famous-boroughs-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">four out of the five boroughs.</a> The ferry system currently has six routes through which it serves neighborhoods like Lower Manhattan, The Rockaways, and the Lower East Side. And in the next couple of years, the New York City Ferry System plans on adding several new stops and routes to their service.</p>



<p>This is by far one of the most pleasant ways to travel around New York City!</p>



<p>New York&#8217;s ferry system offers mini-voyages on the East River, and throughout the New York Harbor to give you sprawling cityscape views. They are also a gorgeous way for non-natives to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-tips-on-how-to-save-money-while-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">absorb the boroughs without spending a fortune!</a></p>



<p>Here&#8217;s your chance to take a break from your normal route and routine, or a mid-weekend activity with or without company! It&#8217;s definitely one of the most leisurely ways to get a glimpse of a lot of what New York City has to offer.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a video by the New York Times on why New York&#8217;s Ferry System is so popular:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="See Why New York’s Ferries Are So Popular" width="1250" height="703" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3r-gVIf-qc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Routes currenty operational</h2>



<p>When the NYC ferry began in May 2017, until the end of 2018, the NYC Ferry ran through six routes: East River, Rockaway, Astoria, South Brooklyn, Lower East Side, and Soundview. (A new Brooklyn Navy Yard stop has since been added to the Astoria Route.)</p>



<p>The main hub for the NYC Ferry is Pier 11/Wall Street, where all lines converge. On summer weekends, you can also find South Brooklyn and East River routes connecting to Governors Island from there.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">For more information on NYC Ferry routes and schedules visit their website here!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much does a ferry ride cost?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s the same as riding the subway: $2.75 for a one-way fare, and $121 for a 30-day pass. You have to pay an additional $1 to bring your bike on board, which translates to $141 for a 30-day pass.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the MetroCard — used for other public commutes, doesn&#8217;t work on the Ferry. However, the ferry service <em>does</em> offer free transfers within its routes up to 90 minutes from when you first board the ferry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can ferry tickets be purchased?</h2>



<p>All ferry landings have electronic vending machines and ticket agents to help you out, but the easiest way by far is to just download the ferry app on your smartphone. This app also offers a detailed breakdown of the ferry schedule.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">And finally,</h2>



<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio launched the NYC Ferry system in 2017, as an alternative to the public transportation offered by the MTA. This was meant to be affordable to everyday New Yorkers just like the subway and the busses.</p>



<p>The latest ferry boats holds up to 350 riders, as opposed to a single subway train that can easily carry upwards of a 1000 straphangers alone.</p>



<p>But even after all its struggles, the ferry system draws millions of riders each year as the city continues to pour resources into it — so you shouldn&#8217;t expect it to go anywhere anytime soon.</p>
