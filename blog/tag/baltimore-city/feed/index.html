You&#8217;ve thought long and hard about this, and now you have finally decided to move. Baltimore, your preferred city, why not?

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Baltimore</h2>



<p>It is the world-famous Inner Harbor, award-winning restaurants, historic neighborhoods, and internationally recognized cultural institutions that make Baltimore an unforgettable destination.</p>



<p>Established in 1729, Baltimore has played a key role in American history, first serving as a hub for trade to the Caribbean and then as a convergence point for the Continental Congress when Philadelphia was threatened. Thus, leading to the city’s rich history culture and a favorite tourist spot.</p>



<p>Francis Scott Key, a renowned lawyer and poet, wrote his famous “Defence of Fort McHenry,” as a result of the British attacks on Baltimore. The poem later became “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Other notable Baltimore-born authors include F. Scott Fitzgerald, Frederick Douglass, and John Dos Passos.</p>



<p>However, your first step would be to find rooms for rent in Baltimore.</p>
