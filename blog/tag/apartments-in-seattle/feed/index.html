<p>Seattle is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. One of the fastest-growing cities in the United States and the seat of King County, Washington, it is a major seaport city with a diverse culture. If you are new to the city then this guide will help you get familiar with the city and find rooms for rent in Seattle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Seattle</h2>



<p>The Seattle area was inhabited by Native Americans for around 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers arrived here. With an interesting history of booms and busts over the years, Seattle has seen booms through the timber industry, the Klondike Gold Rush, and the shipbuilding rush during World War 1. Seattle has a temperate climate with cool, wet winters and mild, relatively dry summers. Extreme heatwaves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures. This makes it a very liveable city if you plan on finding rooms for rent in Seattle to live here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding rooms for rent in Seattle</h2>



<p>Seattle is known for its multiculturalism and diversity. And it occupies one of the most beautiful spots in the United States, located in a narrow isthmus between Puget Sound and Lake Washington. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 142.5 square miles. While most people tend not to venture beyond Downtown, the International District, and the Seattle Center, there are many other areas in Seattle that can be great to find apartments for rent in Seattle.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How transit friendly is Seattle?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1549092196-6f877d6b54bb?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb" alt="apartments in seattle "/></figure>



<p>Downtown San Jose is easily walkable and is encouraged for short trips, especially in the Downtown or Capitol Hill areas. Seattle is also known for its pedestrian&#8217;s unusual refusal to jaywalk, even when there are clearly no cars in sight. While the abundance of footpaths and jogging lanes makes walking easy, some areas can be steep and farther locations will require you to look to other means of transport.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Trains in Seattle</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/documents/schedule-link-light-rail.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link Light Rail</a> operates between the University of Washington and Angle Lake Station with stops in Capitol Hill, Downtown, SoDo, South Seattle, the suburb of Tukwila, and Sea-Tac Airport along the way.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/getting-around/transit/streetcar" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seattle Streetcar</a> has two lines between Downtown and South Lake Union and between Pioneer Square, the International District, and Capitol Hill along Broadway.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.seattlemonorail.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Seattle Center Monorail</a> takes you non-stop between Westlake Center and the Seattle Center in just 2 minutes and is mainly used by tourists.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Water Taxis in Seattle</h3>



<p><a href="https://kingcounty.gov/depts/transportation/metro/travel-options/water-taxi.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Water Taxi</a> travels between Pier 50 and Seacrest Park in West Seattle taking 15 minutes and costs $4.75 or $4 with an <a href="https://orcacard.com/ERG-Seattle/p1_001.do" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ORCA Card</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wsdot.wa.gov/ferries" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington State Ferries</a> connect to destinations outside of Seattle, and also accept ORCA Cards.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis in Seattle</h3>



<p>You can easily hail a taxi from any major street in Seattle and most hotels will be willing to call one for you. However, taxis can be expensive, especially if you are only trying to get around the downtown area. Some taxi drivers may even refuse to take you if your destination is less than 15 blocks away. However, ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are also available and often are a more convenient option. The standard government regulated fairs as follow:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Flagfall for $2.60</li><li>$0.30 for each additional 1/9 mile (a total of $2.70 per mile)</li><li>$0.30 for every 36 seconds of waiting time (a total of $0.50 per minute)</li><li>$0.50 for each additional passenger above 18 after two.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Cycling in Seattle</h3>



<p>Most major roads in Seattle do have cycling lanes and with a surge in popularity, most drivers are also more accustomed to cyclists as well. It can often be much faster to cycle than drive or take a taxi during rush hour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Using the ORCA Card in Seattle</h3>



<p><a href="https://orcacard.com/ERG-Seattle/p1_001.do" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The ORCA card</a> is a contactless fare card that enables you to transfer between Seattle and Puget Sound&#8217;s various transit agencies, similar to Hong Kong&#8217;s Octopus or London&#8217;s Oyster. You can load money or monthly passes to the card or purchase day passes for $8 that can be used for all bus and train services.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cultural activites in Seattle</h2>



<p>With a diverse culture and rich history, there is much to learn about Seattle if you plan on finding rooms for rent in Seattle and living here, with several museums of different genres and lots of outdoor activities as well.</p>

<p>In cities where rent control reigns, housemates can hope to find some security in an unpredictable housing climate. But in Washington State, rent control is <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=35.21.830" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">illegal</a>. This means even if your landlord can’t increase the rent during the lease term, they&nbsp;<em>can</em> set the rent price to whatever they want for the next leasing period. So when <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hunting apartments</a> for rent in Seattle, you’ll need to know what’s allowed, what’s not allowed and how to win over landlords like a pro. Here’s what experts say about finding affordable apartments for rent in Seattle and locking them down.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Apartments for Rent in Seattle: 101</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rent Control and Rent Stabilization</h2>



<p>Rent control is a strict regulation of rent, and it’s a rare and precious thing for few cities. It’s impossible to rent a rent-controlled apartment now. Because once the original tenant vacates it, the unit most often becomes rent-stabilized. Rent stabilization controls rent in a manageable way for both renters and landlords. </p>



<p>This usually applies to buildings built during a certain time period (1947 to 1974 in NYC, for example). Moreover, relies on the state of the&nbsp;local economy and inflation to regulate the allowable percentage increase on rent. This allows landlords to increase rent to keep up with the market without doubling to tripling it overnight.</p>



<p>Sounds great for renters, right? Well, it’s also a highly controversial issue, especially in Washington, where the politicians are split on the subject. Many believe it wouldn’t make a difference in making apartments for rent in Seattle more affordable and that rent control is a “failed economic policy.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What experts say</h2>



<p>Chuck Hattemer, CMO and co-founder of OneRent.co, says that while rent control might look good on paper, it poses new challenges for property owners and renters alike in notoriously rent-controlled areas <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/tips-travel-get-around-san-francisco-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like San Francisco</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The primary issue we see is that owners of rent-controlled units have little to no incentive to perform maintenance or upgrades on their units on a regular basis,” he explains, comparing current events in San Francisco to a hypothetical rent-controlled future for Seattle.</p><p>“Maintenance costs are unregulated, and therefore the numbers just don’t make sense if you wanted to invest $5,000 into renovations but can only raise the rent 1.6 percent and earn an additional $200 a year or something along those lines.”</p></blockquote>

</div></figure>



<p>Hattemer argues that the lack of rent regulations in Seattle is a more beneficial system, allowing investors to renovate old or undesirable buildings to market levels, and charge the standard rent. And the renters?</p>



<p>“For a certain portion of the population, they’re OK with rent raises because they know (and expect) that the owner will invest in improving their unit in order to match a higher rate,” he says. A Slippery Slope. So where does that leave renters? On a slippery slope, to say the least. Though the lack of rent control essentially frees up the housing stock, it doesn’t help in a tight rental market. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview of rent control in Seattle </h2>



<p>According to Seth Stephens, a professional landlord at Renters Warehouse of Seattle, there is a lot to consider when you hit the local rental market — the first being a shortage of supply.“ The biggest hurdle facing the Seattle area is lack of homes on the market and the cost of them,” he says. “A quality home is being rented in a matter of hours or days with multiple applications, making it tough for tenants to find that perfect home.” </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>That’s not surprising, considering the vacancy rate in the area can vary from as high as 4.6 percent to as low as 1.4 percent, depending on the neck of the woods you’re renting in. And availability is just one of the issues.“ The average two-bedroom rent in Seattle is $2,400 monthly,” Stephens continues. “As you get into the surrounding areas, you see those prices drop, but it’s still not exactly affordable.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deeper insights on rent in Seattle</h2>



<p>These are some of the reasons local renters have been crying out for the return of rent control in the last few years. In a market based on inflation and government-regulated control, the rent might be more adaptable, and so would the renters. </p>



<p>As it stands, Stephens says that owners have had to catch up to the market, and tenants looking for apartments for rent in Seattle may very well be suffering because of it.“ We’re seeing many owners who have had tenants for three to four years and have no idea the market is up $300 to $800 monthly,” he explains.</p>

<p>Considering a month-to-month tenant must only be given a 30-day-notice before a landlord can raise the&nbsp;rent, it’s important to know a few key things about apartments for rent in Seattle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Negotiating, Communicating, and Rooming Up</h2>



<p>If you’re wondering what’s a renter to do in a no-rent-control-high-demand-low-supply market, don’t worry — you’re not alone. Here are some great tips to navigate the rental market in Seattle (or anywhere, for that matter).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1.&nbsp;Sign a Longer Lease</h3>



<p>According to the <a href="http://www.tenantsunion.org/en/rights/rule-changes-rent-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Washington Tenants Union</a>, in apartments for rent in Seattle, a landlord cannot change any aspect of a lease during the fixed-term period except by mutual agreement. So the longer your lease term, the longer you can hold onto a great deal. In many cases, landlords prefer tenants who are willing to sign longer leases because it offers them security as well. (More on that in the next section.)</p>



<p>And to really find a great deal? It’s all about getting in early, says Hattemer.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“You’ll want to look in areas that are still developing and on the up-and-up. This will mean that you can lock down a long-term lease in an area that is going to have lots of new development, job opportunities, new restaurants, new things to do, new public transportation, and more.</p><p>“To rent in Seattle specifically, look at neighborhoods such as North Queen Anne, Magnolia, or West Seattle.”</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Negotiate With Your Landlord</h3>



<p>Yes, this is totally allowed and <em>always</em> recommended. Apartment prices aren’t fixed, and you may be surprised at your bargaining power. Negotiate the rent&nbsp;before you sign a new lease. And before you resign an old lease, keeping in mind your strong suits.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Tenants who have low-debt-to-income levels, stable jobs, and good credit are still the ideal tenants for an owner. So taking care of your finances will help in negotiations,” recommends Stephens.</p><p>“The other part is your flexibility. If you can do a longer term lease, this will allow an owner to justify dropping the rent or being open to certain terms a tenant might want.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Keep in mind that landlords aren’t picky just for any reason. The better you present yourself, the better your bargaining power.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“It’s important that the renter demonstrates that they understand this property is an investment. And thus the owner is financially motivated,” adds Hattemer, who also reccommends offering additional incentives deposits for pets.</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Communicate With Your Landlord</h3>



<p>To rent in Seattle alone isn&#8217;t enough. Remember when we said landlords are human, too? Keep that in mind when trying to build a good repertoire.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“A landlord has two major concerns. They want rent paid on time and their home to be taken care of” Stephens continues. “If you can accomplish these two things, you can keep an affordable home. And also have a good relationship with the landlord.”</p></blockquote>



<p>And to ensure timely maintenance and a well-kept residence, it’s vital to keep your landlord up to speed about any issues.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Landlords appreciate tenants that are proactive, flexible, and patient,” adds Hattemer.</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Room Up</h3>



<p>And a final word to the wise. There’s a reason why average renter household size <a href="http://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/report-renting-in-americas-largest-metros" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has increased</a> in 11 of America’s largest metros. In some cases the landlord must raise the&nbsp;rent to keep up with the market. Then you find someone to chip in on the bills. So as to help you hold onto affordable apartments for rent in Seattle.
