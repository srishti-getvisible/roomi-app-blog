<p>Before we get started on how to create the perfect workspace at home, here&#8217;s your daily reminder to straighten your back when you work from home. Now, moving on!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been 6 months since we&#8217;ve been spending time in a work from home situation. And chances are, most of us are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">still trying to find that sweet spot</a> of the perfect workspace. And one that intersects optimal productivity and comfort to get your through 8 business hours. </p>



<p>There are many DIYs to inspire you to re-do your workspace at home. But if you&#8217;re renting a fairly small space, the landlord might not want you overstepping.</p>



<p>However, the great thing about re-doing your workspace at home is that it doesn&#8217;t take a lot of effort (or money.) To create the perfect workspace requires no alteration to the property you are renting.</p>



<p>But what does it mean to have the perfect workspace? A work space that feels right. And one that helps you avoid distractions the best you can, so you can work the way you like. Basically, the kind that doesn&#8217;t make you want to doze off after reading just 3 emails.</p>



<p>Here are our key pointers that will make all the difference to your work from home days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. The desk for your perfect workspace at home</h2>



<p>Ergonomics calls for matching your workspace to your work needs. Rule number one is matching the top of your monitor to your eye level. However, setting a functional desk also requires other additional components that we will cover in just a second. But the perfect workspace requires, well, nothing at all. Yep, a clutter-less desk is one of the key components to optimizing your productivity. Some people swear by standing desks. These keep the posture correct, especially for those with more severe issues. And also allows you to take a healthy amount of breaks, which are just as much of a need during this work from home period.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. The chair for your perfect workspace at home</h2>



<p>They key to not dozing off when working from home is creating a comfortable space that isn&#8217;t too comfortable. All you need is cushioning and ample armrest. Nothing more/less. That is basically it to make your perfect workspace. Get a cushion to support your back and make sure your arms are slightly lifted at the shoulders at all times &#8211; if not, they cause your shoulders and neck to work overtime inflicting long term posture issues.</p>



<p>The backrest of your chair is possibly the most important component in keeping your posture in check, keep you working for the exact amount of time you need to, by keeping the pain away. We definitely recommend investing in a comfortable, quality chair to create your perfect workspace. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The window</h2>



<p>Believe it or not, some people prefer working in slightly darker rooms. But countless studies show that natural light can charge our work-time productivity and make a substantial difference to our moods. Harvard Business Review goes as far as calling natural light, <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/09/the-1-office-perk-natural-light" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the number 1 perk employers can offer their employees.</a></p>



<p>For this reason alone, we recommend setting up shop as close to a source of natural light as you can to create the perfect workspace at home. Even if you are working from your bed in a friend&#8217;s basement, optimize all sources of light through hacks like mirrors and clutter-less furniture. That fresh air is a great supplement for your 4th cup of coffee. Maybe not the 1st or the 2nd, but definitely for the 4th.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The d√©cor for your perfect workspace at home</h2>



<p>The simplest of additions, like adding artwork or a funky calendar to the nearest wall in view, placing a plant close by, maybe even some incense sticks can alleviate your mood while you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/20-work-from-home-relatable-memes-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">work from home</a>. Fake plants would probably not have the same desired effect here, as an actual plant comes with some added benefits like helping with stale air, for free.</p>



<p>There are also people who prefer adding accent pieces like a really fancy chair, maybe a cozy blanket nearby, a hanging desk? These are all things that make the space more <em>you, </em>and personalization of home offices is a known trick to make the perfect workspace at home!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The power</h2>



<p>There can honestly never be enough organizing for your perfect workspace at home. Every power-based device you use requires to be charged throughout the day and there are truly, few things as frustrating as a bunch of tangled wires stopping you from finding the one charging cable you are looking for.</p>



<p>Power strips also help you not overwhelm all of your outlets. And make it easier to not fight with your roommate over power points or trip accidentally.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="10072" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/work-from-home-essentials-for-the-renting-roomi/attachment/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1024,683" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Power outlets with chargers" class="wp-image-10072" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/power-outlets-in-workspace-at-home.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Dealing with the noise when you work from home</h2>



<p>A highly recommended addition to office spaces in general is adding some sort of sound. The logic being, absolute silence can be distracting. White noise playlists are a great replacement for people who find it difficult to focus with lyrical music. There are also tons of &#8220;beats to chill/work/study to&#8221; playlists on YouTube and Spotify with fitting music that can help (increase) your focus. You might need to spend some time figuring what kind of music helps you focus best, so be sure to take your time.</p>



<p>A good pair of headphones are also a great investment if you are living with other people around the house. You can look to brands like Bose for top quality noise cancelling headphones &#8211; though there are also some really good cheaper alternatives available online.</p>

<p>More and more of us working from home now! Maybe it&#8217;s our regular job or we&#8217;re trying to find part-time work to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/7-ways-to-make-money-online-during-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make money online during quarantine</a>. Either way, we wanted to get some WFH office tips from the home experts at HomeLight. So let&#8217;s dive right in and learn how to turn your room into a part time office!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is HomeLight?</h2>



<p>In brief, HomeLight is on a mission to change the outdated face of the real estate industry. They empower people to make smarter decisions during one of life‚Äôs most important moments: buying or selling a home. So their team builds products to help their clients get the best possible outcome. And in this case, turning your room into a part time office!</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs what they shared with us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HomeLight‚Äôs top tips on turning your bedroom into a part-time office</h2>



<p>In the post-COVID-19 world, remote or part-time work is becoming the norm. This leaves many people wondering how they can turn a dedicated space in their home into a part time office. It might be tempting to just drag your laptop to your kitchen table and get to work. But creating a part time office is key to establishing a successful home work environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As more people are working from home, real estate agents are finding that a home office is <a href="https://www.homelight.com/blog/real-estate-top-agent-insights-for-q3-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a feature that buyers are searching </a>for in their next property. Here are some tips to create the part time office that will work for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Create a separate space</h2>



<p>The first rule of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.homelight.com/blog/home-office-staging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creating a functional home office</a> is having an area that is for work and work only. Even if it‚Äôs a table that is pulled down from the wall as a desk. How much space you can allocate will depend on the size of your home. But even without an entire room to work with you can get creative! A corner desk in the living room, guest room, or even a closet with the door open will work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One tip to remember with a part time office is that it doesn‚Äôt have to be set-up all the time. Having a desk that folds away, or a cabinet to store your work items will help you get things done quicker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be productive, you need adequate lighting. If your part time office doesn&#8217;t have <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/why-natural-light-is-the-best-apartment-decor-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural light</a>, use wall or desk lighting to create a warm, inviting space. Place your desk near a window to contribute to your focus and alertness for part-time work. As video calls are becoming the norm, consider how the light hits your screen to avoid glare if possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Organize your part time office</h2>



<p>Storage will help you tuck away your office for the day, especially if it is in your living room. So the items to consider are filing cabinets for invoices or other paperwork, drawers for pens, notebooks, or other tools of your trade. If you have the luxury of an entire room with a closet for your part time office, you can transform it into a storage center by adding shelving and cabinets.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Make it ergonomic and sustainable</h2>

<p>When you are working from home whether it&#8217;s full time or part-time work, it might be tempting to sit on the couch and work all day. But this is not conducive to an ergonomic work environment, or to stay focused for several hours. Ideally, you can add a monitor to protect your eyes. And if you have the space you can consider both standing and sitting desk options.</p>



<p>In conclusion, one of the perks of working from home is that you can make your workspace your own part time office, adding touches that will help you feel comfortable.</p>
