<p>Once you are aware of what you spend in a month, you can begin to&nbsp;shape your recorded outgoings into a workable budget.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Using a Budgeting App is one of the best money saving techniques</strong></h3>



<p>Consider using an app like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mint.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mint</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.budgetdirect.com.au/interactives/savings-plan/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Savings Goal Planner</a> that keeps track of your spending goals, expenses, and budgets.

<p>Well, It’s that time of year again &#8211; the time of snowfalls and rising expenses. Of course, there is so much to like about this season- <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/diy-christmas-decorations-a-hygge-experience-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the decorations</a>, the food, the drinks and <em>especially</em> <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/stores-in-new-york-city-for-the-sustainable-shopper-roomi-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the gifts</a>. But all good things come at a cost, literally. For every gift you receive, you have to give one back. Oh, the cruel rules of the holidays. Which is why, we all need to learn some money-saving tricks for Christmas. Yes, we&#8217;re talking DIY Christmas gifts and home decor.</p>



<p>Yes, the pandemic means that the holidays won’t be as expensive as they usually are. You can’t have those big family dinners or parties this time. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that there won’t be any additional expenses. And besides, because we all have to stay home, it’s the perfect time to get a little creative this holiday season and save some money. So without any further ado, let’s take a look at some tricks you can use to save money this Christmas.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of the oldest money-saving tricks for Christmas: Budget</h2>



<p>Yes, I know, this is one of the more obvious money-saving tricks for Christmas. But it would be next to impossible to save any money without making a budget first. Sitting down and making a budget means you will have to plan ahead of time and be more precise about what you want to buy. This way, you&#8217;re less likely to get distracted and waste money on frivolous things.</p>



<p>But just keep in mind that making a budget is the easy part. What’s a lot harder is actually following through with it. The holiday season, in particular, will bring with it a million alluring things that you will feel like you <em>need</em> to own. RESIST THE URGE. There is no point in making a budget if you&#8217;re not going to stick to it. An easy way to make sure you don’t overspend is by shopping with cash. This may be a little harder right now given the pandemic, but if possible, withdraw the amount of cash you need and spend only that.</p>



<p>Of course, it won’t always be feasible to use cash which is why you need to be extra careful with your credit card. You don’t want to wake up to a holiday debt hangover in January.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get a holly jolly (Secret) Santa</h2>



<p>You know, Secret Santa doesn’t have to just be an obligatory office tradition &#8211; you can actually bring it home! Instead of buying lots of generic gifts for everyone you know, you can put a lot of thought into buying a gift for just one person instead. Talk to your friends and family and see if they’d be interested in starting this fun Christmas tradition! You could even  make your own DIY Christmas gifts!</p>



<p>The element of mystery in Secret Santa is actually really exciting, and you can arrange a big Zoom reveal party on Christmas morning. Decide on a budget beforehand and get to work on your (hopefully) awesome and thoughtful present. This is one of the most fun money-saving tricks for Christmas!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of the best money-saving tricks: Avoid last-minute shopping</h2>



<p>Last-minute shopping is the Judas of every well-planned budget. You might think that buying a few things at the last second won&#8217;t hurt your bank balance &#8211; but think again. Procrastination costs! No money-saving tricks for Christmas will work if you keep shopping till the last minute!</p>



<p>Make your shopping list ahead of time and start ticking off items early. This way you can guarantee that you will be able to find and buy everything on that list, and your days leading up to Christmas will be STRESS FREE. You can even spend your time working on your Christmas home decor! <em>Hallelujah</em>!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">DIY Christmas gifts</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s no gift as thoughtful and irreplaceable as the one that is made by hand. Homemade gifts are the greatest way to show your friends and family how much you love and care about them. Not to mention, it&#8217;s one of the greatest money-saving tricks for Christmas! Not only would your gift be completely unique, but creating a homemade gift can also be a really fun activity when pandemic-boredom strikes. Which is why DIY Christmas gifts are the best option for everyone right now. </p>



<p>Find out what the recipient’s hobbies, likes/dislikes are and then decide what that perfect handcrafted gift would be. Maybe it’s a card, a picture college, or their favourite meal &#8211; there really are no rules here.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make the most of holiday sales!</h2>



<p>One great thing about this time of year is all the<a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10220-holiday-sale-days.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> different sales </a>that you can take advantage of! From Black Friday to Cyber Monday, this is a really good time to get a great deal on your Christmas gifts. If you are running particularly late with your Christmas shopping, consider doing it on Super Saturday, which falls on 19th December, the last full Saturday before Christmas. We would suggest getting all your Christmas home decor during these sales! Honestly, this is one of the most satisfying money-saving tricks for Christmas!</p>



<p>Apart from these, check out your local shops and favorite online stores to see what year-end sales they have. Just be cautious with your spending &#8211; many sales are designed to encourage you to buy things you don&#8217;t really need!</p>



<p>Good luck out there, Roomis, and have a Merry Christmas!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s inevitable that in your &#8216;adult&#8217; life you’re going to buy useless things you don&#8217;t need. Things you waste money on and then never use again. Completely unnecessary things you think you need to buy in the moment, but forget about even before they arrive. These tips can guarantee you make a lot fewer of these purchases, to keep those dollars in check. </p>



<p>In the long run, it’s about being honest with yourself about what you really need versus what just looks good in the store/your best friend’s place/that Instagram grid. One thing we can all admit: we all have gone a little crazy with the online shopping this year!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. the most unnecessary gym equipment you think you need to buy</h2>



<p>With the quarantine and work from home being the new normal, a lot of us at the beginning got really enthusiastic about our fitness goals. And for the rare ones that actually did utilize their gym memberships prior to the pandemic, they now feel the need to recreate their entire gym experience at home.</p>



<p>Getting basic things like a good quality yoga mat, comfortable clothes to work out in and a decent pair of shoes is okay, but feeling the need to have the machinery for all the fancy things you saw on your favorite fitness blogger’s Instagram account is way too much. It is unnecessary equipment that you don&#8217;t need to buy!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:177%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Y4i4fVAJkpOcxHpQCN" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4i4fVAJkpOcxHpQCN/giphy.gif"></iframe>

	</div>
	


<p>For the average person, there are various effective workouts that you can do at home using just a mat, a chair, a wall, and your own body weight. There are also plenty of awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAPCPjnU1wA" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channels that you can watch</a> for free, that go over all kinds of home workout routines that cater to whatever goals or needs you might have.</p>



<p>So, don&#8217;t invest in any fancy gym equipment. Because, believe us, in a couple of years, you will look at the same fancy equipment and wonder how you ended buying such useless things you don&#8217;t need!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Highly specific ingredients for food</h2>



<p>This one&#8217;s for all the home chefs. How much time have you spent searching for <mark>unnecessary</mark> ingredients you think you need to <mark>buy</mark> in order to make your dish perfect? If you’re someone who has gotten into looking up recipes online, you know what we&#8217;re talking about. You&#8217;ve probably come across recipes that call for very specific items that you&#8217;ll only use for that one dish. And if you’re new to cooking, it&#8217;s natural to feel the need to buy that exact item for the exciting new recipe. But most of these specific ingredients will end up being one of the useless things you don&#8217;t need in your pantry.</p>



<p>But if you commit yourself to have a basic familiarity with different ingredients, flavors, and textures, you will find that you can in fact substitute this very specific item or even sometimes go without it. Don&#8217;t let a one-time use ingredient be one of the things you waste money on!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. New/perfectly matching furniture</h2>



<p>It’s easy to feel like your pride is wrapped up in having new things in your house. Or have everything match perfectly so that you feel like a fancy adult. It’s so easy to lust after that beautiful set of matching glass set or kitchenware. But, remember, there are also so many pretty things to be found in other places! Your local thrift stores, Goodwill, or even in neighborhood-specific Facebook groups will have some beautiful gems hidden in them! Don&#8217;t pay exorbitant amount of money on <mark>unnecessary</mark> furniture just because you think need to <mark>buy</mark> a matching set.</p>



<p>Of course, there are some furniture items that you want to be a little cautious buying secondhand. For example, anything with fabric can be dicey at a thrift store. It&#8217;s also really important that you not associate brand new with &#8216;yours&#8217;. Because something can be just as meaningful even if it’s third or fourth hand from a yard sale! Expensive furniture doesn&#8217;t have to be one of the things you waste money on!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>But all things said and done, remember to not beat yourself up over every little financial decision. The point is to think hard about what is really worth to you. And then avoid buying pointless things because our brain loves shiny, new things! </p>
