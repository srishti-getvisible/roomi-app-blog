<p>Co living trends state that it is on the rise, and the demographic of those who choose to share their homes is expanding. So roommates aren’t just for college kids and young professionals. Where once a&nbsp;<a href="http://ur.umich.edu/0708/Jun23_08/09.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">struggling single parent</a>‘s only alternative to living alone was to move back in with family. Choosing to co live with other single parents is becoming an increasingly popular option. And why not? The benefits of co living with other single parents are abundant:&nbsp;splitting costs for childcare, more playmates for only-child kids, and the freedom to parent with like-minded people. With <a href="http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/newsroom/facts-for-features/2015/cb15-ff08_mothers_day.pdf?cssp=SERP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9.9 million single moms</a> in America raising kids younger than 18 (and the percentage of <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/07/02/the-rise-of-single-fathers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">single fathers on the rise</a>), single parents are catching on to the co living trend. We can’t say we’re too surprised.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is co living and what are co living trends?</h2>



<p>Co living is more than a fancy term for having roommates or housemates. It’s a conscious decision to share your home with people who enrich your day-to-day life. Traditionally, co living has been considered a temporary solution for young professionals trying to cut living expenses.&nbsp;But today it’s a way of life that more people are opting in for. And for some unexpected roommates — from&nbsp;seniors to single parents — they wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>



<p>Author and single mother of four <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Darkness-Angie-Fenimore/dp/0553099663/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angie Fenimore</a> falls into the latter category of co living trends.&nbsp;She currently has 10 people living in her house. All of whom split the bills and household chores, but this wasn’t always her normal lifestyle. Fenimore&nbsp;chose this setup after an unexpected co living experience changed her life and showed her the benefits of co living.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“My friend was raised in a polygamist community, and though she left that lifestyle in her early 20s, it influenced how she&nbsp;approached shared&nbsp;responsibilities and how she treated everyone who stepped foot in her home&nbsp;as family. It introduced me not only to a far more economical, but also a more rewarding lifestyle. We all shared the home for seven months, and the experience completely altered my view of communal living.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Once she got back on her feet, Fenimore opened the doors for others.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The benefits of co living as per co living trends</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I’ve exchanged everything from homework tutoring and cooking for room and board and some babysitting on my part to splitting costs equally,” says Fenimore, who has now lived with dozens of single parents.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Splitting the bills</h3>



<p>A common driving factor for many roommates, splitting the bills on housing and utilities can be really helpful for single parents. Especially for those with young children,&nbsp;who have hundreds of dollars in additional expenses for things like formula and diapers, the benefits of co living are abundant.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Splitting the housework</h3>



<p>It’s hard enough keeping a house clean, and throwing toddlers into the mix does not help. It can be nice for single parents just to have other adults around to make sure the trash gets taken out and the dishes get done.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Sometimes we share food, sometimes we divide up shelves. We have laundry days, and we create a map for how everything is managed and who is responsible,” says Fenimore.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">More access to childcare</h3>



<p>The <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-youll-spend-on-childcare_1199776.bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">average cost of childcare</a> is $972 a month <em>per child</em>. For a&nbsp;mother of four, that’s $46,656 a year. One of the greatest benefits of co living is <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-benefits-of-living-with-roommates-vs-living-alone/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">having a roommate</a> who helps out by watching the kids.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Having playmates and companionship</h3>



<p>If childcare isn’t a viable option and you’re the parent of an only child, it can be tough knowing your child is missing out on important social interaction. Having a roommate who also has kids provides an only-child with a playmate or two.</p>



<p>Plus, being holed up with a tiny person who yells incessantly and watches “Yo Gabba Gabba” for hours until they fly into a sleep-deprived, sugar-induced tantrum isn’t exactly healthy for your sanity either. The added benefits of co living with another adult to talk about grownup stuff cannot be undervalued for the single parent.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“After Jordana moved out, Angelina moved in,” Fenimore says of her first and second housemates. “She was living in her car and was a mother of three children who were in her ex-husband’s custody. Angelina really just needed support and a loving, safe environment. She was able to get on her feet and move into an apartment with other roommates. We’ve remained friends and still see each other from time to time.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Downtime</h3>



<p>A lot of parents will agree that the only downtime they enjoy is when their kids are asleep. And <a href="http://www.redbookmag.com/life/friends-family/advice/a40026/im-a-single-mom-looking-for-a-roommate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even that isn’t a guarantee</a>. For single parents who don’t have a partner to split up the duties, co living trends point to&nbsp;downtime becoming an option again.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Miranda had a one-year-old little girl when she moved in,” Angie says, speaking of one of her many single-parent roommates. “I watched her daughter on occasion so she could date, run errands, and have some down time.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Maybe Danny Tanner was onto something with the co living trends of Full House</h2>



<p>It may seem that co living is a relatively new concept among single parents. But folks like lovable&nbsp;father of three and clean freak Danny Tanner&nbsp;were showing us how awesome this setup could be way back in the late ’80s. Like the “Full House” gang, Fenimore says she fully agrees that co living trends can introduce people to meaningful connections and lifelong relationships.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Family has little to do with DNA. I’ve assisted so many other parents and benefited from the support of so many others that I’ve lost count. I’ve found that we quickly get over the awkward experience of not being related and simply create a family.”</p>
</blockquote>
