										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Can your apartment building’s roof do more than protect you from the elements? A lot of people can’t even say it does that. Terrible landlords. Bad housing. Rising costs. There has to be a solution that can benefit everyone. And there is. It’s called green roofing.</p>



<p></p>



<p>With green roofing, the answer is yes…to all of the above. Over the years, sustainable living has taken center stage, and rightfully so. Using green roofs &#8211; think lush greenery, blooming flowers, and even small vegetable gardens right on top of buildings &#8211; continues to gain traction, particularly in urban areas.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not just about aesthetics, either. These eco-friendly roof systems offer incredible benefits for both individual residents and the broader community. If you’ve been curious about how green roofs could transform apartment living, you’re in the right place.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>From improving air quality to saving you money on heating bills, we’ll break it all down. Here are the key insights you need to understand how green roofing could redefine your living experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-green-roofs-and-why-should-you-care">What Are Green Roofs, and Why Should You Care?</h2>



<p>Green roofs, or living roofs, are rooftops covered in vegetation that’s planted over a waterproof membrane. They can range from lush gardens to minimalist moss or grass coverings. But these aren’t just pretty to look at. Green roofs bring many advantages to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/urban-living-with-digital-assistance/">urban living</a> that extend far beyond the plant life they sustain.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The increasing popularity of sustainability in general, but this type of roofing in particular, comes from its practicality in urban environments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-for-renters-nbsp">For Renters&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Traditional black tar roofs absorb heat and contribute to the urban heat island effect, where cities end up hotter than surrounding rural areas. By contrast, green roofs help cool things down while also reducing energy consumption and promoting sustainability.</p>



<p>For apartment dwellers living in concrete jungles, transforming your roof into a thriving green space could bring a breath of fresh air &#8211; literally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-for-landlords">For Landlords</h3>



<p>But what about landlords? How will this impact your bottom line? Straight up. It isn’t cheap. Check out <a href="https://roofsnap.com/solutions/roofing-software-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roofsnap roof estimating software</a> for yourself to see how much it will set you back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as far as the long run, it’ll save you a ton of money &#8211; both for yourself and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/personal-finance-for-first-time-renters/">your renters</a>. It may even end up making you a little extra. Think of all the hipsters willing to pay a premium for this product.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-environmental-and-health-benefits">1. Environmental and Health Benefits</h2>



<p>Living in a busy city often comes with its fair share of air pollution, noisy neighbors, and limited green spaces. Green roofs offer a breath of opportunity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improved-air-quality-nbsp">Improved Air Quality&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Did you know green roofs act as natural air purifiers? Vegetation on rooftops can capture dust, pollutants, and harmful toxins. It’s a great way to provide city residents with cleaner, healthier air in their living spaces.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reduction-of-urban-heat-island-effect-nbsp">Reduction of Urban Heat Island Effect&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Green roofs act as nature’s air conditioning system. Replacing the heat-absorbing materials of traditional roofs with lush green coverage reduces rooftop temperatures. Not only does this cool your building, but it can also alleviate the city-wide heat island effect.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-boosts-for-mental-health-nbsp">Boosts for Mental Health&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Green spaces<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/businesses-incorporate-wellness-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> improve wellbeing</a> &#8211; this isn’t new information. But access to greenery directly on the roof above your apartment makes these benefits accessible every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies consistently highlight how green spaces reduce stress, increase happiness, and offer a psychological boost. Imagine a tough day melting away as you step onto a lush rooftop terrace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-cost-savings-and-long-term-value">2. Cost Savings and Long-Term Value</h2>



<p>At first glance, green roofing might seem like a luxury only high-end properties can afford. But look closer, and you’ll notice it’s also a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/reduce-household-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smart financial decision</a>.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong> &#8211; One of the biggest advantages of green roofs is their energy-saving potential. They provide natural insulation, keeping buildings cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. Tenants and property owners will have lower heating and cooling costs.</li>



<li><strong>Longevity Matters</strong> &#8211; Traditional roofs have to be replaced frequently due to exposure to harsh weather. Green roofs, on the other hand, protect the membrane underneath and extend the lifespan of your building&#8217;s roof.</li>



<li><strong>Boosting Property Value</strong> &#8211; Properties with green amenities are increasingly in demand. Depending on the location, green roofs attract higher rents and sales prices. It’s not just a roof to the right buyer or renter &#8211; it’s an investment both financially, for their mental health, and for the planet.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-what-it-takes-to-build-a-green-roof">3. What It Takes to Build a Green Roof</h2>



<p>Creating a green roof requires more than a few plants and some soil. It’s important to understand the planning stages and practical considerations.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Structural Requirements</strong> &#8211; Not every building can hold the weight of a green roof. Structural assessments are crucial to identify whether your apartment building can handle the extra load of soil and plants. Consulting certified engineers or architects is often your first step.</li>



<li><strong>Waterproofing and Drainage</strong> &#8211; Waterproofing and <a href="https://www.salazarroofing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repairing your roof</a>, and installing proper drainage systems are non-negotiable. They need to retain water for hydration, but without proper drainage, leaking could become an issue.</li>



<li><strong>Legal and Technical Hurdles</strong> &#8211; Municipal governments may have regulations you’ll need to follow, especially in densely populated urban areas. Governments in cities like Toronto and New York offer incentives for these initiatives, so understanding local policies could save you money (and headaches).</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-the-social-upsides-of-green-roofs">4. The Social Upsides of Green Roofs</h2>



<p>Beyond personal and environmental benefits, green roofs contribute to building stronger social connections among residents.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-community-building-nbsp">Community Building&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Rooftop gardens often become shared spaces where residents can gather, unwind, or even grow their own produce. Imagine getting to know your neighbors better through rooftop yoga sessions or afternoon coffee breaks surrounded by greenery.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-urban-agriculture-nbsp">Urban Agriculture&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Some go beyond being visually appealing by growing fruits and vegetables. Not only does this create a sense of accomplishment among residents, but it also supports healthier living through local, organic produce.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improved-quality-of-life-nbsp">Improved Quality of Life&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Having access to a tranquil space just a few steps away from your apartment creates opportunities to relax and recharge. It’s a luxury that city-dwellers usually have to leave their buildings to find.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-addressing-challenges-and-finding-solutions">5. Addressing Challenges and Finding Solutions</h2>



<p>Like any innovation, they do come with their challenges &#8211; but they aren’t deal-breakers by any means.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Initial Costs</strong> &#8211; Yes, green roofing is an upfront expense. However, grant programs, city incentives, and long-term savings often offset these costs, making it more feasible for apartment communities.</li>



<li><strong>Maintenance Requirements</strong> &#8211; Caring for them is more labor-intensive than maintaining a traditional roof. It involves watering, weeding, and occasional replacement plants. Partnering with professional landscape companies can ease this burden.</li>



<li><strong>Resistance to New Ideas</strong> &#8211; Convincing residents or property managers to invest might face some pushback. Sharing well-researched data and case studies helps underline the benefits and address concerns.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-redefining-apartment-living-with-green-roofing">Redefining Apartment Living with Green Roofing</h2>



<p>Green roofs are more than an architectural trend &#8211; they are a powerful step toward improving urban living. From improving air quality and reducing energy costs to fostering mental well-being and community connections, they provide a solution that intertwines environmental responsibility with personal and social benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While challenges like initial costs or maintenance requirements exist, the long-term advantages far outweigh these hurdles. Investing in green roofs creates sustainable buildings and lifestyles, contributing to healthier cities and a brighter future for apartment dwellers. It’s time to reimagine what urban living can be &#8211; starting from the top.</p>

<p>No doubt about it — moving to a new city is a life-changing decision that feels both exciting and scary. There are a lot of things you need to consider: rent, cost of living, the livability of the city, type of neighborhood, and more. These factors can cause quite a hassle, but coupled with the thought of finding a good roommate? Now, that’s immensely stressful.</p>



<p>With a city as big as New York, there are a ton of ways to look for roommates. There isn&#8217;t a lack of websites for this purpose, but there sure are certain features and elements that set the best apart from the basics.</p>



<p>Sure, you’ll have Facebook groups and Craigslist posts to explore. However, a more advisable way to find good roommates is by using roommate finder apps like Roomster, or the Roomster alternative, Roomi.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-roomster-vs-roomi-main-differences">Roomster vs Roomi: Main Differences</h2>



<p>Don’t worry about the stress of seeking the best roommate finder; we’ve done so for you!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are These Roommate Finder Apps Free or Paid?</h3>



<p>Roomi definitely comes out on top when compared with other roommate finder websites. This is because Roomi has no monthly subscription fees, no costs for messaging, and signing up and listing a space on Roomi is free. It’s even free to search for a place to rent.</p>



<p>However, to get the absolute best out of Roomi, it’s advisable to subscribe to its paid services. Roomi has three available subscription plans: the Premium plan for personal use, the Solo Agent, and the Business Unlimited plan for business users.</p>



<p>These paid plans include background checks, identity verifications, messaging plans, listing credits, profile boosts, and listing boosts. All of these are tailored to your needs with the following benefits:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Access to unlimited messages and swipes in your search for potential roommates</li>



<li>Post five to unlimited active listings simultaneously.</li>



<li>Free bookings</li>



<li>Fully verified status upgrade</li>



<li>Ability to boost listings with subscriptions</li>
</ol>



<p>Roomster allows users to pay for a 3-day subscription, which is enough to test the app. But a Roomster subscription costs $9.99 to $49.99. The subscription is automatically renewed after a month unless you cancel it manually. And based on some Roomster reviews, several users have complained about the exorbitant fees charged for things like viewing messages.</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/is-roomi-free-to-use/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Is Roomi free to use?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust">Security: Can These Apps Help Me Find Roommates I Can Trust?</h3>



<p>If you want to live with another person in a new city, it’s vital that you find someone who&#8217;s trustworthy and safe. Sharing your living space with another person is a big deal.</p>



<p>You would probably like to live with someone who takes hygiene seriously, respects boundaries, and is reliable. This is where roommate finders come in. Roommate finder apps such as Roomster and Roomi are great, but it’s normal to ask questions like, ‘Is Roomster legit?’ or ‘How well is my profile protected?’.</p>



<p><strong>ID and Contact Infomation Verification</strong></p>



<p>Roomster allows users to verify their identity using social media, email addresses, phone numbers, and identification with a simple process. However, due to voice-over-IP services, it has provided a entryway for scammers. Also, verifying your identity with Roomster isn&#8217;t an appealing process. Roomster requires you to send a scanned picture of your verification, then pay $14.99 to begin ID verification.</p>



<p>Moreover, Roomster reviews regarding the quality of ID Verification have not been positive, with users concerned about the additional fee required for identity verification. But with Roomster&#8217;s alternative, Roomi, identity verification comes with your subscription.</p>



<p>In order to assure users’ safety, Roomi makes sure to verify the identity of every user on the platform. Users are required to submit a government issued-ID before they can become verified users. And with this, you get a verified badge that&#8217;s useful in speeding up your search for a roommate.</p>



<p>Additionally, Roomi makes use of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/more-information-about-global-id/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">GlobaliD</a>, a digital identity platform that puts you in control of your identity and your data. With GlobaliD, you can have your number and email verified by Roomi, while your privacy is assured.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy and Security of Profiles</strong></p>



<p>Roomster allows you to create a profile where you can post stories, pictures and social media links to its community. They also ensure that all the information you add is authentic.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://roomiapp.com/how_it_works" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Roomi</a></p>



<p>Roomi, however, allows users to share meaningful information that makes all the difference when searching for roommates. Visible information on a Roomi profile includes age, profile photo(s), preferred location, budget (if entered), move-in date, summary, work info, interests, roommate preferences, lifestyle, and more.</p>



<p>Roomi also offers its users secure in-app messaging, keeping the information shared between you and your potential roommate private. Another reason Roomi stands out as a great roommate finder app is that you can request for the deletion of all personal information after successfully finding a roommate. Users can do this under the General Data Protection Regulation Act by contacting <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/how-do-i-delete-my-account-on-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Roomi customer support</a>, or by filling out a form.</p>



<p><strong>24/7 Support &amp; Content Moderation</strong></p>



<p>It’s definitely disappointing to think you’re well on your way to finding a roommate while using a roommate finder app, only to realize that it’s not legit. You don;t have to worry about that with Roomi, as the platform has an in-house moderation team that works to remove spam profiles and fake listers from the platform.</p>



<p>24/7 customer support is also provided with an enlightening <a href="https://roomiapp.com/faq" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FAQ page</a> to answer all your questions and make your roommate searching easier.</p>



<p>Roomster provides customer service as well, yet some reviews say that they weren&#8217;t as useful, nor as around the clock as Roomi&#8217;s customer service.</p>



<p><strong>Criminal Background Check</strong></p>



<p>Roomi does optional <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/what-weve-learned-from-processing-over-100000-background-checks/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">criminal background checks</a> by Garbo<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for user profiles so that you know who you’ll be living with. Submitting your profile to Roomi for a criminal background check helps to boost roommate matches.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">User Profiles: Which App Makes It Easier to Find Your Perfect Roommate?</h3>



<p>Most people have fallen victim to phony Craigslist ads and scammers on Facebook while searching for rooms for rent and roommates. With all this in mind, Roomi made it a priority to make the process easier and stress-free. Both Roomster vs Roomi are great, but Roomi definitely takes the cake when you compare their features.</p>



<p>With Roomi, you can filter choices for potential roommates. It may be awkward to ask a potential roommate some specific questions, which is why Roomi has provided the option of filtering roommates based on neighborhood, gender, budget, location, and more. With Roomi’s roommate matching algorithm, you can be sure of finding a roommate perfect for you. Roomi has an age filter, an LGBTQ+-friendly filter, and even a house rules filter.</p>

<p>For better or for worse, co-living with another person and sharing your living space can leave a lasting impact. The facts about roommates and co-living with them are that it’s not easy&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/9-reasons-why-living-with-a-roommate-is-awesome-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">but it does have its perks</a>.</p>



<p>Apart from companionship, co-living with a roommate helps you save money as you can split bills and other utilities with another person. So when you find yourself in a co-living situation, you need to be aware of the facts about roommates and the types of roommates and personalities that you’ll see.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-14-types-of-roommates-you-ve-probably-come-across">14 Types of Roommates You&#8217;ve Probably Come Across</h2>



<p>Here are 14 types of roommates you&#8217;re sure to come across, or have already had an encounter with in the past.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-the-neat-freak">1. The Neat Freak</h2>



<p>The neat freak comes with unexpected cleaning standards (think dust free picture frames and a labeled kitchen cabinet). These types of roommates are so dialled into the itty-bitty details, and it can be fun (for a time!), but if you’ve been living on a different planet and haven’t watched&nbsp;<em>Friends</em>, how will you learn about managing your real-life Monica Gellar at home?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s mostly easy to deal with the type of roommate who like things clean and organized. The trick is to make sure you do your part to keep common areas clean. You can trash your room all you want, but never let the mess go out of your own space. If you&#8217;re sharing the room, then your junk should only be on your bed.</p>



<p>Look at the bright side, appreciate your sparkling apartment, and do your bit to keep it looking beautiful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Clingy Roommates</h2>



<p>Making new friends is important, but some roommates tend to be too friendly that they become &#8216;clingy&#8217;. They invade your personal space and can even act as your shadow. Sharing a co-living space assumes a license for the clinger to be friends with your friends and go wherever you go.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make boundaries when living with a clinger</h3>



<p>With the clinger type of roommates, try to keep your private life private and don&#8217;t share too much. Be gentle in drawing lines, as they might throw a fuss and create a self-pity situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The Quiet One</h2>



<p>With this type of roommate, there aren&#8217;t any greetings and they don’t talk unless you ask them a question. They’re in and out of the house like a stealthy cat. Don’t expect more than a wave or a subtle nod from them.</p>



<p>When living with <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">quiet roommates</a>, it&#8217;s best to leave a written note if you wish to communicate.&nbsp;You&#8217;re actually considered lucky if you&#8217;re living with quiet roommates, as compared to some of the others in this list.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The Party Animal</h2>



<p>This is the type of roommate who never goes to class unless surrounded by fraternal brothers or sorority sisters. Their favorite time is late at night when they’re partying, and they come back home with a crowd of people. They&#8217;re the extroverted version of the clingers who are often shy.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make house rules that limit guests</h3>



<p>To deal with this type of roommate, talk to them about it in a matter of fact tone with no overkill. Social butterflies always have a crowd buzzing around them, so try to setting boundaries in the apartment. Maybe you could limit guests to only stay until a particular time in the night or to tone it down after 10 P.M. because we all need our beauty sleep.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The Lover</h2>



<p>Since you’ve started living with them you’ve seen a a record breaking number of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/what-to-do-dont-like-roommates-partner/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">individuals</a> walk out of their room every morning. And sometimes this type of roommate carries their display of affection outside their bedroom.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Try to avoid being embarrassed when living with the romantic type</h3>



<p>Living with a romantic type of roommate means you need to have an unspoken code before you walk in the room, like a hat on a doorknob. If you still happen to walk in on them during an awkward lip-smacking session (or worse), suggest that they should have date nights someplace else other than your crash pad. They&#8217;ll get the picture.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. The Passive Aggressive One</h2>



<p>One of the reasons people behave passive aggressively is the fear of direct display of anger. The way to communicate with them is to keep it simple and to be assertive. It’s best to avoid gossip and huffing and puffing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Keep a check on the words you use</h3>



<p>The best way to communicate with passive aggressive roommates is through written notes. In case their random notes surpass your patience levels, you can join them at their own game. Leave a post-it note: <em>“Had your leftover pizza as I was hungry. It was yummy.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Slobs</h2>



<p><a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/help-roomate-is-a-slob/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">The slobs</a> are one of the most difficult types of roommates to live with. They have no basic hygiene or cleaning habits. They’re easy to spot – think dirty clothes piled up, food wrappers, unwashed dishes, and always in need of a shower.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Honestly, you can’t really do anything about them</h3>



<p>One thing you need to know about slobs is that they make those choices consciously, so a conversation may not kick them into action. The best way to go around this is to create boundaries for their mess, and deal with them as you would with a reverse of the neat freak. If creepy crawlers are coming up to your space or if you cannot do without an odor mask, talk to your resident assistant (RA) or start looking for a new place.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Night Owls</h2>



<p>This type of roommate finds themselves most productive when everyone goes to sleep. The night owl roommate lives with you but has the routine of a resident country on the opposite side of the globe.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s nice about this type of roomie is if you need someone to wake you up in the middle of the night, you can count on them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. The Hermit</h2>



<p>The live-ins love their room so much that they probably don&#8217;t come out of there. They even skip class or work to watch TV or play a video game in peace. Hermits are similar to the quiet ones, but hermits value their privacy and personal space more. Usually, this type of roommate engages in solitary activities, like reading or doing their own hobbies in their own space.</p>



<p>The best way to deal with hermits is to tell them that you need space to study or work, relax, and have friends come over. Come up with a compromised way of space sharing. If you have separate bedrooms and rarely see this roommate, consider it a blessing. Just keep an eye out to see if your roommate&#8217;s still <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/spotting-telltale-signs-of-anxiety-in-your-roommate-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">doing okay or not.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Types of roommates who “borrow” a lot</h2>



<p>These are the type of roommates who like to “borrow” your things. The items may not be generally expensive, but the habit is annoying.</p>



<p>Try to be honest with your your roommate and tell them how their behavior makes you feel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Give them a taste of their own medicine</strong></h3>



<p>Else try and behave like them and text them, “Can I borrow your perfume?” It might help.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">11. The Athlete</h2>



<p>Having an athlete as a roommate can be good and bad. Good because you can be inspired to hit the gym or try out some new sports, and bad because there could be a lot of workout gear in the apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">12. Mother/Father Figure Roomie</h2>



<p>These types of roommates are always looking out for you. The Mother/Father figure always ask, &#8220;are you okay?&#8221;, &#8220;have you eaten?&#8221;, &#8220;why are you home late?&#8221;. But don&#8217;t get them wrong, they aren&#8217;t overbearing, they just genuinely care about you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">13. The Chef</h2>



<p>Living with an aspiring chef, or just a person who knows how to make gourmet chicken nuggets, will have you eating good at the apartment. The only downside is that the kitchen can get messy, and your roommate may need a helping hand. Another could be hearing pots and pans at three in the morning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">14. The Roommate Turned Bestie</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s not always that you get a roommate and best friend in one, but sometimes luck is just on your side. These types of roommates give you a feeling like you&#8217;ve known each other for years, when in reality, it&#8217;s only been a few months.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking of looking for an apartment but don’t really know where to start, we’ve got you! We understand the stress of planning to move, apartment hunting, and even budgeting. More than that, there’s always this question of, “when should I start looking for an apartment?”. The apartment rental market can be unpredictable, so having an apartment hunting timeline is the best way to prepare for your move.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When Should I Start Looking for an Apartment?</h2>





<p><a href="https://au.reachout.com/-/media/young-people/images/legacy-articles/moving-boxes-around.jpg">Source</a></p>



<p>If you’re planning to move out, the question of when to look for an apartment totally depends on you. But, there’s an apartment hunting timeline you can follow that’s easy and will make moving out totally hassle free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Ideal Apartment Hunting Timeline</h3>



<p><strong>2-3 months before moving in:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Do your research.</strong> There are a lot of things you should consider before actually moving in. The first is deciding when and where: when’s your move-in date and where you’ll be moving in. Your move-in date is crucial because you’d have to think of your current lease, your job, and even insurance policies.</li>



<li><strong>Start budgeting.</strong> The second step is knowing your budget and sticking to it! Once you have a move-in date, you’ll be able to get a better grasp on when you need to start allotting money for your new apartment. Plus, getting a head start on an apartment fund can be beneficial for you; you can have extra cash in case of emergencies.</li>



<li><strong>Understand how applying for apartments work.</strong> Once you have your date and budget, knowing how applying and renting apartments work. This way, you can prepare any extra documents that’ll take time to get, just in case.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>24 to 30 days before moving in:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prepare all requirements.</strong> Having all of your documents ready before starting to look is one of the best apartment hunting tips you should know. This way, the application process will be a lot more smoother and hassle-free.</li>



<li><strong>Tour apartments.</strong> Now, a lot of people ask, “when should I start looking for an apartment?” there’s an ideal time frame for this! Looking three to four months out is too far, and two weeks is cutting it too short. Usually, apartments are listed 24 to 30 days before the move-in date, so an apartment available on September 1 will probably be put on the market on August 1.</li>



<li><strong>Make a list.</strong> Now that you somewhat have an idea where you’ll be moving to, it’s best to list down your top choices, from the type of apartment, to the available amenities, accessibility, how close it is to your work, the hospital, banks, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Put in an application on your top pick.</strong> Once you have everything and you’re set on a place, put in a rental application. Usually, you’ll know whether you’re approved or not within five business days.</li>



<li><strong>Confirm the move-in date and start packing.</strong> If you have any more outstanding paperwork to sign, this is the best time to schedule a time for it. Make sure that all the documents you need are good to go.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>7 days before moving in:</strong></p>





<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/UTw3j_aoIKM">Source</a></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Confirm your moving details.</strong> Whether you booked movers or asked help from friends, this is the time to finalize all the details.</li>



<li><strong>Pack all your essentials in one bag.</strong> Put at least a few days worth of clothing, necessities, paper work, and important IDs in one bag for easy access. In case you need anything, it’ll be easier to find and get.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Moving day:</strong></p>



<p>On the day of your move-in, it can get a bit stressful. But if you followed the timeline and have all your documents ready, you don’t have to worry. You can expect the unexpected, but by the end of the day, you’ll be in your new apartment!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Apartment Hunting Tips</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Think about what you really need in an apartment. When searching for apartments, it’s important to think of your needs more than your wants. Do you really need that extra room or is one enough?</li>



<li>Familiarize yourself with the lease terms and obligations. Before signing anything, take time to review it. If the landlord seems like they don’t want you to go through it, that’s generally a bad sign. Without reading the lease terms, you may be signing yourself up for terms you disapprove. Also, come prepared with a list of questions when meeting with the landlord! Make sure that if you’re planning to sign the contract and live there, your living situation is the best for you (and your landlord).</li>



<li>Be wary of rental scams. If you’re planning to move, make sure that you have your guards up. Use <a href="https://roomiapp.com/">trusted room finders</a>, do reverse image searching, and meet the landlord or property manager before paying a deposit. Rental scams will always be there, but you can avoid it!</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds like homework, but this is the first step to identifying the traits your roommate should possess! List out the qualities that you want and what you don’t want. You may want to discuss this with a close friend or a colleague. Try to be as specific as possible.</p>



<p>If you have lived with roommates before, you can also list out what you liked and disliked about them. Here are some ideal <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate/">qualities in a roommate</a> that you should consider.</p>

<p>Finding a great roommate can be truly awesome. If everything goes well, you will get a best friend in disguise and a trustworthy confidant. Having said that, you will also come across many <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/">types of roommates</a> in your life.</p>



<p>You may come across a roommate who is an absolute slob- ignoring the messy spaces they create and leaving dishes uncleaned. On the other hand, you may also find someone who is organized like Monica in <em>Friends</em>&#8211; who makes their beds every morning and always volunteers to clean the kitchen. While there is no one reason to say which personality can fit your requirements, finding someone with whom you can communicate easily is important. Everyone has some flaws but as long as it doesn’t hamper your lifestyle and your mental health, you can always get along.</p>



<p>Once you are clear about what you want from your roommate, you can proceed to find the perfect one in a few simple steps!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interview-questions-to-ask-your-potential-roommates">Interview questions to ask your potential roommates</h2>



<p>While you meet and greet a couple of people in your roommate hunt, a good interview is all about the important questions. It doesn’t have to be as grilling as a job interview— but having a good roommate can be as important as landing a good job, don’t you agree?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/cheerful-diverse-friends-talking-at-table-with-coffee-in-cafe-6457517/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>Asking the right questions is important so that you are clear about who you are living with. Figure out what is important to you in a living situation and frame your questions accordingly.</p>



<p>Here are some <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/potential-roommate-questions-you-should-ask/">potential roommate questions</a> that you must ask?:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>“What is your work? Work from office or home?”</strong> This would determine if they would pay their rents on time and how often you’d expect to see them around. If you are interacting with students, you can ask about how they are planning to pay rent— is there a parent who is providing, or do they work part-time?</li>



<li><strong>“What do your weekends look like?”</strong> It may not seem significant, but you should know if they have any hobbies or like inviting friends over. And if they like doing the same things as you, it couldn’t get better.</li>



<li><strong>“Have you lived with roommates before?”</strong> It would be great to know if they have had good co-living experiences and what kind of people they have lived with before. It could be a red flag if they only talk about bad experiences. If they have never lived with roommates before, you could be the first to face some challenges.</li>



<li><strong>“How do you feel about cleanliness and household chores?”</strong> Sharing an apartment is sharing responsibilities, and cleaning is the top priority. Tell them about your thoughts first and see if they comply.</li>



<li><strong>“What kind of roommate do you want?”</strong> Just like you have made a checklist, your roommate candidate must also have one. Ask them what they are looking for to see if you match.</li>
</ol>



<p>Add more questions as you seem necessary. But be ready with all the answers yourself first. The interview should have them asking you questions as well. And if they don’t ask you anything, that would be <em>fishy</em>!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finding-a-roommate-within-your-network">Finding a roommate within your network</h2>



<p>Before you go on looking for roommates online or on public networks, it’s best to begin from your inner circle. You can turn to family, friends, or co-workers— find a trustworthy name and reach out.</p>



<p>But <em>warning bells</em>, maintain your guard and don’t get carried away just because you found a familiar name. People can be amazing when you meet them in a cafe or outside to chill, but it&#8217;s an entirely different story when it comes to sharing a space. Therefore, ask your questions and clarify every doubt regarding the living situation. Look out for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roommate-red-flags/">roommate red flags</a> to avoid a horror story.</p>



<p>If you found a great friend who is also in need of a roommate, be careful. Best friends are generally not your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/making-perfectish-roommates-a-reality-roomi/">soul roommates</a>. You must set boundaries from the get-go and be respectful of private space. If that doesn’t happen from the beginning, it can be a disaster!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-find-a-roommate-on-social-media">How to find a roommate on social media?</h2>



<p>If you don’t find anyone in your personal network, don’t worry. Social media platforms can be pretty helpful to expand the search. You may meet familiar names through your followers on these channels. But you may also meet new people with similar interests and backgrounds.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> is great for roommate hunts where you can reach out to a large number of people through groups as well. Create a strong bio mentioning all the details, and you can meet some interesting people.</li>



<li><strong>Instagram</strong> can help you reach out to your followers. Create a newsfeed post or story describing your requirements, and you are good to go. You may also use hashtags for your locality or city.</li>



<li>Create a <strong>Twitter</strong> post to ask your followers if they need a roommate. Again hashtags can be very useful here.</li>



<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> is generally more about your professional circle. So, you may get someone from a similar work background to live with you. Make a detailed post about your needs and requirements, and connect.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-in-white-shirt-holding-red-pen-4003763/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>You may also come across other roommate-looking people posting about their needs on social media. Reach out to them via comments or DMs to ask if they can talk. Be respectful and polite just like you would expect them to be. Make sure to refer to your checklist while <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/top-5-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-roommate/">choosing a roommate</a>. You can also use The <a href="https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QR Code generator</a> to easily share your profile or checklist with potential roommates.</p>

<p>Modern roommate finders have developed the best techniques to avoid scammers and help you reach trustworthy people. Features like background verification and roommate bios can easily help you shortlist your potential roommates in time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finally-signing-the-roommate-agreement">Finally, signing the roommate agreement!</h2>



<p>When you move into a new apartment, you must know about the rental agreement that you sign for the landlords. But guess what can be even more important? A <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/4-things-include-roommate-agreement/">roommate agreement</a>!</p>



<p>Yes, this does not involve your landlord or any third party other than your roommates. Finding a good roommate is one thing, but maintaining a good roommate relationship is an entirely new domain. Before you start worrying about cleaning schedules and establishing rules regarding house guests, there must be a reference point that all parties agree upon.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/women-at-the-meeting-3810795/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>There may be times when your roommate vanishes for days without any notice. And what if they forget about paying the rent? Collecting money for utilities can be more tricky than paying rent. A roommate agreement can help you avoid such tricky situations.</p>



<p>Here are some important things that you must mention in your roommate agreement.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Paying rents and bills</strong>: Messing up with the finances can lead to a lot of tension between roommates. Determine the list of things you would be sharing apart from rent, like Wi-Fi and groceries. Who will handle the rent payments? Electricity and other bills? Before anything leads to a dispute— have a meeting and discuss. List out the person responsible for collecting and paying for utilities. Clearly mention the due dates and exact amount to be paid. There are also some amazing apps for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/3-awesome-apps-splitting-bills-roommates/">splitting bills with roommates</a> to make the task easier.</li>



<li><strong>Household chores and apartment maintenance</strong>: While living with a roommate, cleaning schedules and dividing chores is a must. No one wants to clean up for the mess they didn’t make in the first place. It is best to prepare a chore list and include it in the roommate agreement- add schedules and task ownership.</li>



<li><strong>Entertainment and hosting guests</strong>: It could be fun to host parties in your apartment once in a while and invite guests over. There can be visits by friends, family, and partners. However, not everyone in the house will love it every day. Set limitations on how frequently one can invite guests and how long the stay can last. Make rules regarding the noise levels and smoking zones.</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s good practice to follow some common <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roommate-etiquette-guidelines/">roommate etiquette</a> to avoid conflicts, and a roommate agreement seals the deal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-stay-sane-and-happy-while-living-with-roommates">How to stay sane (and happy) while living with roommates?</h2>



<p>It’s important to know how to be a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/how-to-be-a-good-roommate/">good roommate</a> first- <em>what goes around comes around</em>. Here are some practices to enjoy your apartment life to the fullest:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Always communicate</strong>: Just like any other relationship, communication is key. Living together, you may come across situations when things don’t sit tight with you. Understand that it’s okay to disagree on certain things and move on. However, don’t let the tension build up with the silent treatment. Talk to them politely to fix and resolve such situations. Most roommates can talk out disputes and find solutions, but things can get tricky if you have a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/5-common-behaviors-passive-aggressive-roommate/" class="broken_link">passive aggressive roommate</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Spend time together</strong>: An important part of living with a roommate is to know more about them. Have a coffee session together or watch a movie together. Spending time together will help you develop a good friendship and trust each other more.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain boundaries</strong>: Whether it’s sharing food or Wi-Fi, be clear about the boundaries. It is important to give space to your roommate. Even if you live in a small apartment, make some arrangements so that everyone can enjoy some personal space when they need to.</li>

<p>Considering a move to New York City? There are probably a thousand and one decisions for you to make. But one of the most important ones is which borough you’re going to move to. A lot of newcomers are stuck choosing between Manhattan and Brooklyn because of their reputations. So which borough is best for you: Brooklyn vs Manhattan? Which comes out on top? Well, that all depends on your personal requirements.</p>



<p>Keep reading if you want to find out whether Brooklyn vs Manhattan is better suited to your needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="comparing-brooklyn-vs-manhattan">Comparing Brooklyn vs Manhattan</h2>

<p>Brooklyn and Manhattan are two different but equally charming boroughs. They’re also both top destinations for people looking for new jobs, career opportunities, and those moving for school. To decide which is better for you between Brooklyn or Manhattan, here are a few things for you to consider:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-rental-cost">1. <strong>Rental Cost</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re gunning for a studio apartment, there’s not much difference in the rental costs in Brooklyn vs Manhattan. In 2019, the median <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-manhattan/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rent in Manhattan</a> for a studio apartment was $1848 a month. In Brooklyn, for the same kind of property, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the median rent</a> was $1952.</p>



<p>However, when you start looking at larger apartments, the coin flips, and the cost difference becomes steeper. The rent in Manhattan may be double what it is in Brooklyn. Plus, apartments in Manhattan tend to attract a higher property tax (because they are valued more highly).</p>



<p>Your choice will eventually boil down to the size of your budget and your preferred apartment choice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-type-of-building">2. <strong>Type of Building</strong></h3>



<p>While some people like the beauty of townhouses, others like the convenience of a condo. When choosing between Manhattan vs Brooklyn, it’s a good idea to decide what kind of housing you want. Sure, you can find all kinds of houses in both boroughs. However, Manhattan is known for its skyscrapers and townhouses. On the other hand, Brooklyn is famous for its loft spaces and cobblestones.</p>



<p>As a result, it will generally be easier to find an apartment in a skyscraper in Manhattan than in Brooklyn. And it’ll likely be easier to get a loft apartment in Brooklyn rather than Manhattan.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-cost-of-living">3. <strong>Cost of Living</strong></h3>



<p>The cost of living in Brooklyn vs Manhattan is lower. Whether you’re shopping or dining, living in Manhattan is way more expensive than living in Brooklyn. You have to pay significantly more for the same standard of living.</p>



<p>However, the median income in Manhattan is also higher. This means, if you live and work in the borough, your salary will cover your increased living expenses. So, in the end, it’ll boil down to almost the same cost.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-commute-time">4. <strong>Commute Time</strong></h3>



<p>How much time are you willing to spend in traffic when you’re going home or to work? Thanks to its huge population and the large numbers of tourists, traffic is heavy in New York.</p>



<p>Between Brooklyn vs Manhattan, the commute time is faster in Manhattan. Not because there is less traffic, but because there are multiple public transport options around the borough. Bear in mind, too, that many of the people that work in Manhattan live in Brooklyn. This contributes to a longer commute time.</p>



<p>But don’t let this put you off if you have your heart set on living in Brooklyn. A lengthier commute gives you time for relaxation, meditation, or catching up on your favorite sitcom!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-crime-rate">5. <strong>Crime Rate</strong></h3>



<p>The crime rate has <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/pr0502/index-crime-continues-decline-april-2019#/0" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued to decline in New York City</a> over the past two decades. According to Neighborhood Scout, Brooklyn and Manhattan have similar crime scores. This is despite them having different population sizes.</p>



<p>Regardless of where you decide to move to, you’ll want to feel like you are safe. So, here are a few emergency numbers for the city of New York for you to note down:</p>



<p><strong>Police or Fire Emergencies</strong>: 911</p>



<p><strong>NYC Information</strong>: 311</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-food">6. <strong>Food</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re as much of a foodie as I am, then you’ll want to choose a borough with great restaurants. Between the two boroughs, Manhattan boasts the best dining halls and restaurants. You’ll be spoiled for choice trying to decide which to choose on your next outing.</p>



<p>But don’t rule out the restaurants in Brooklyn either. With classy customer service, lively atmospheres, and breathtaking views, Brooklyn restaurants have it all. Plus, you can expect to get more varied options for cheaper prices in Brooklyn than in Manhattan.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-quality-of-life">7. <strong>Quality of Life</strong></h3>



<p>Manhattan and Brooklyn are top destinations for people looking for work, schooling, and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/fun-things-to-do-in-manhattan-in-a-single-weekend/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">fun in the Big Apple</a>. And rightly so. The quality of life in both boroughs is very high. But Brooklyn just clinches it.

<p>Clearly, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-perks-brooklyn-apartments/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living in Brooklyn has it perks</a>, but so does living in Manhattan. But which one is best for you?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving to a new city? Your mind is probably brimming with questions right now &#8211; such as where and with whom will you live? The journey to your dream apartment is a pretty long one. You’re trying to find the best room finder, navigate interviews and make sure you can actually afford the place you want! So let’s get started, shall we? In this guide, you can compare HousingAnywhere with the HousingAnywhere alternative, Roomi, to learn more about these handy websites.</p>



<p>Now, take a breath of relief as we dive into finding the best room finder portal for you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-have-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What Filters &amp; Preferences Do These Room Finders Have to Help you Find your Perfect Room?</h2>



<p>A good room finder should offer you various search options that you can filter for speed and convenience. Typically, you should be able to filter by location, amenities, apartment types, price range, and more. This will help you simply jump on and input your preferences, making room finding fast, easy and stress-free.</p>



<p>Let’s compare the filters on offer with Roomi and HousingAnywhere.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No fee apartments</h3>



<p>When moving to a new apartment, you want to reduce your costs as much as possible. However, most apartments have some fees in the form of brokerage. On HousingAnywhere, you have to pay 25% of the first month’s rent as a one-time fee. But the HousingAnywhere alternative, Roomi, has no-fee apartments available to explore. This means that all listings are free &#8211; all you pay is the rent!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>



<p>You can&#8217;t leave your furry or feathery best friends behind, which is why there&#8217;s a pet-friendly filter on Roomi. There are distinct pet categories, where you can choose apartments suitable for dogs, cats or other pets. HousingAnywhere also provides the option to search pet-friendly apartments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Subletting is the process of renting an apartment or room inside a rental to another person for a set period of time. This is often tricky because the subtenant signs an agreement with you rather than with the landlord. Roomi has simplified the process for you.</p>



<p>On the Roomi app, you know who you&#8217;re living with by asking potential roommates to complete a background check before they apply to your listing. Furthermore, everything is documented and verified. You can also keep your contact info private by chatting to potential roommates through the Roomi app or website. HousingAnywhere, and other websites like HousingAnywhere also allow subletting services. However, the process is not always as transparent as it is on Roomi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>HousingAnywhere provides 5 amenities to filter your search by &#8211; a washing machine, air-con, dishwasher, dyer, and heating. But, you know what’s more convenient? A room finder that goes one step further and offers updated, important features, such as being able to find a non-binary roommate to live with. In fact, the HousingAnywhere alternative, Roomi includes all the filters HousingAnwhere has &#8211; and then some!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type (Entire Place/Shared Rooms)</h3>



<p>Both HousingAnywhere and the HousingAnywhere alternative, Roomi, allow you to filter on the basis of listing type. Again, the number of options varies between the apps.</p>



<p>For example, HousingAnywhere allows you to choose among a private room, shared room, studio, and apartment. Roomi not only checks if you want an entire place, your own room, or a shared room, but also allows you to choose how many rooms you’d prefer the listing to have.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>



<p>Everyone has their preferences, and most people want to live with roommates that have similar values and lifestyles as they do. With this in mind, Roomi allows you to filter choices for potential roommates. You can filter roommate searches based on age, gender, and house rules — the pet-friendly filter comes in useful here, too. HousingAnywhere also provides a few options to filter based on house rules, but not quite as many as Roomi.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which App Offers the Best Free and Paid Features?</h2>



<p>No one wants to fork out high fees for a room finder that doesn&#8217;t offer the best features. Roomi knows what matters to its users, and provides awesome features on both the free and paid plans.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

	</div>
	


<p>The Roomi pricing structure in a nutshell:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Free Members on Roomi:</strong> Free to sign up and list a place to rent.</li><li><strong>Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription:</strong> The Gold Subscription is available at $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week.</li></ol>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive deeper to see some features that make Roomi stand out from other room finders such as HousingAnywhere.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>On Roomi, it’s free to post an advertisement for a place to rent. Users can post up to two listings for free in any of the locations that Roomi supports. Likewise, it&#8217;s free to search for a place to rent. However, if users want to move more quickly, paying for Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription plan is recommended. Here’s what you get with the Gold subscription plan:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings</li><li>5 active listings to post all the empty rooms in your apartment</li></ul>



<p>HousingAnywhere, on the other hand, charges a 25% commission fee on the first month’s rent for both parties &#8211; whether they’re moving into a new place or renting out a room.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-App Messaging</h3>



<p>Roomi, the HousingAnywhere alternative, offers secure in-app messaging to its users, keeping information shared between potential roomies private. Users can also request that Roomi deletes personal information after they&#8217;ve found a roommate match. They can do so under the General Data Protection Regulation by contacting Roomi customer support or by filling out a form. With Roomi, you can also message any lister for free &#8211; a feature that&#8217;s not available on HousingAnywhere.</p>



<p>&lt;aside&gt; ? Deep-dive: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/faq/is-roomi-free-to-use/">Is Roomi free to use?</a></p>



<p>&lt;/aside&gt;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-listings-are-credible">Security: How Do These Apps Ensure That Listings Are Credible?</h2>



<p>If you want to live with another person in a new city, your safety is your topmost priority.</p>

	</div>
	


<p>Roomi&#8217;s reputation as the best room finder is in part thanks to its commitment to the privacy and security of its users. Roomi protects you in the following ways:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The process of verifying your Listers account is a reliable way to ensure that the person living in the apartment you’re about to rent from is genuine. The verification process involves providing a copy of your lease, utility bill, or government-issued ID.</li><li>Your Roomi listing address is not visible to others on the app. Instead, only an approximate location is shown.</li><li>Roomi&#8217;s in-house content moderation team will review any listing or profile that violates Roomi policy.</li><li>If you’re uncomfortable or concerned about something you see, you can easily report it to Roomi’s 24/7 moderation team.</li></ol>



<p>HousingAnywhere, on the other hand, does not offer such rigorous security measures. HousingAnywhere reviews on several portals even mention it as illegitimate and unscrupulous. Users have also written about HousingAnywhere scams on these portals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, which is the Best Room Finder for you?</h2>



<p>A good room finder can make all the difference to your experience. There are a good number of roommate finder apps out there, but in our comparison of HousingAnywhere and the HousingAnywhere alternative, Roomi, there’s no doubt that Roomi comes out on top.</p>



<p>With its no-fee listing to advanced features and filters, Roomi simplifies the process of finding a place you can call home!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that moving to a new place is a life-changing experience that is exciting and terrifying in equal measures. There are many factors to consider, including rent, cost of living, city livability, neighborhood type, and more. These concerns might be stressful enough on their own, but when you add in the prospect of finding a suitable roommate? It can be overwhelming! Luckily, using roommate finder websites like Kopa, or the Kopa alternative, Roomi&nbsp;makes finding suitable roommates a breeze!</p>



<p><strong>Don&#8217;t sweat about finding the best roommate finder; we&#8217;ve already done that for you! Let&#8217;s get started.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are these roommate finder apps free or paid?</h2>



<p>There are a variety of options for finding housemates. But how can you know which is the best roommate finder? There are several ways to separate the best from the rest, with pricing being one of them!</p>



<p>When compared to other roommate finder websites like Kopa, its alternative Roomi clearly comes out on top. Why? Because there are no monthly subscription fees, no messaging fees, and it&#8217;s free to sign up and post a room on Roomi. It&#8217;s also completely free to look for a rental. Of course, if you want to get the most out of Roomi, there are paid premium services on offer.</p>



<p>Background checks, identity verification, messaging plans, listing credits, profile boosts, and listing boosts are all included in the Gold Plan bundle. Great, right? It costs $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week to subscribe. You&#8217;ll enjoy benefits like more visibility, robust security and could find a room faster!</p>

<p>On Kopa, hosts market their properties, and renters apply to and book those listings, find housemates, and pay deposits and monthly rent. There are no Kopa service fees for renters. Although, keep in mind, while using a credit card, renters pay a 2.9% + 30 cents credit card processing fee. If the payment is from an international account, there is an additional 1% transaction fee.</p>



<p>Users can send security deposits and leases via the platform. Renters need to pay&nbsp;a security deposit when they reserve a&nbsp;room, and that money is sent to the lister directly. Hosts can also&nbsp;refund security deposits to their renters directly through Kopa.&nbsp;They&nbsp;have the option to refund security deposits, add interest where appropriate, and upload copies of receipts for renters to examine when they move out.</p>



<p>They don&#8217;t offer background checks or credit checks at this time. If those things are important to you, it&#8217;s something you&#8217;ll have to arrange separately with the renter, which can be a long-winded process. A few Kopa reviews on <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/kopa.co?stars=1">Trustpilot</a> suggest that renters are facing issues with refunds due to improper management. For this reason &#8211; and some others that we&#8217;ll cover in the next section &#8211; Roomi makes the best Kopa alternative.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust">Security: Can these apps help me find roommates I can trust?</h2>



<p>In general, life in a new city is expensive. You want to save money in as many ways as possible, and finding safe roomies is one way to do so. Aside from that, you&#8217;ll want to be sure you&#8217;re getting the most bang for your buck.</p>



<p>Finding roommates on websites like Kopa&nbsp;and Roomi are fantastic, but it&#8217;s natural to have concerns such as &#8220;are these platforms&nbsp;legit?&#8221;.&nbsp;&#8220;How effectively is my profile protected?&#8221; or &#8220;How can I find safe roomies&#8221;?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="verification-of-roommate-contact-info">Verification of roommate contact info</h3>



<p>The majority of the renters on Kopa are approved by their employers, who are also Kopa&#8217;s business partners. Before messaging you, renters fill out a rental application. The only downside in terms of security is that, if you want to do a background check, you need to request one.</p>



<p>The Kopa alternative, Roomi, also considers the security of its users a priority. As such, it ensures the contact information of every user is obtained and verified, excelling in this area. Without invading your privacy, Roomi verifies your contact information (email and phone number). They use the trusted GlobaliD service for this.</p>



<p>Roomi&#8217;s goal is to make finding roommates as safe and secure as possible. Every user has the choice to authenticate their identity and do a background check so that others know they&#8217;re speaking with a genuine, reliable person.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="id-verifications-for-potential-roommates">ID Verifications for potential roommates</h3>



<p>The alternative of Kopa, Roomi conducts verification of your government-issued ID and keeps that information safe using GlobaliD. This means that Roomi allows you to&nbsp;select information to keep or remove, depending on specific circumstances. You will obtain the confirmed badge once your ID has been validated, which will strengthen your listing and increase your chances to find suitable roommates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="privacy-security-of-profiles">Privacy &amp; security of profiles</h3>

<p>Similarly, Roomi goes above and beyond to protect your data using GlobaliD. It also gives you control over your data, allowing you to delete or change it in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Once you&#8217;ve found someone who fits your criteria, you may contact them using the app&#8217;s safe in-app chat feature. You won&#8217;t have to disclose any additional personal information with a potential roommate as a result of this.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="24-7-support-content-moderation">24/7 support &amp; content moderation</h3>



<p>The main source of assistance at Roomi is a comprehensive FAQ section that addresses practically every topic that may come up. An in-house content moderation team is also available to provide further help and content moderation so you can find rooms or roommates stress-free!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="criminal-background-checks">Criminal background checks</h3>



<p>Kopa does not conduct any criminal background checks unless you make a request. Unlike Kopa, Roomi is thorough, and conducts prior criminal background checks against known international and relevant local intelligence.</p>



<p>Roomi is not only simple to use with a clean user interface, but it also streamlines your roommate search while protecting your privacy and considering your interests. With these features, you&#8217;ll find safe roomies in no time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-profiles-which-app-makes-it-easier-to-find-your-perfect-roommate">User Profiles: Which App Makes It Easier to Find Your Perfect Roommate?</h2>



<p>When looking for a place to rent or for your next roommates, don&#8217;t put up with the hassle or scams that can come with Craigslist and Facebook. You can&nbsp;use Roomi to find roommates with a process that&#8217;s as simple and stress-free as they come. Both roommate finder apps are excellent, but when comparing their capabilities, the alternative of&nbsp;Kopa, Roomi, comes out on top.</p>



<p>Because it can be difficult to find roommates the way you want, Roomi has made it possible to filter roommates by neighborhoods, gender, budget, and other variables.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Additionally, with Roomi&#8217;s Perfect Roommate Matching Algorithm, you can be confident that you&#8217;ll discover the perfect roommate for you. Roomi offers a filter for age, an LGBTQ+ friendly filter, and even a filter for home rules.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-roommate-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Roommate Finder For You?</h2>



<p>There are a lot of roommate finders out there, but only a handful of them provide the qualities you&#8217;ll need to find good roommates. Fortunately, Roomi&nbsp;has everything! Unlike websites like Kopa, where there is no formal verification, the Kopa alternative Roomi protects your personal information, has verified users, and carries out thorough&nbsp;background checks.</p>



<p>Start your journey with Roomi today and find&nbsp;a roommate in no time!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Having a roommate to split bills with can be helpful, especially in a new city. But with the many roommate finders available, which one can <em>actually</em> help you find an appropriate roommate? Well, you don&#8217;t have to look too far! Here&#8217;s a rundown of two roommate finders: Facebook and Roomi. We&#8217;ll be talking about and comparing the features of both apps, the pricing, and the level of security that it can provide its users. So, if you&#8217;re unsure whether to find roommates on Facebook or another app, read on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are These Roommate Finder Apps Free or Paid?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:75%">

<p>Both Roomi and Facebook are free-to-use, but some features may be a deal-breaker when it comes to finding roommates. For one, there&#8217;s a risk of your private information leaking on Facebook as the app has been known to have security issues. Facebook also has no safety net due to listings and groups being managed by random people, and there&#8217;s no guarantee that the listings are genuine. So, you have to be on constant lookout for scams.</p>



<p>Whereas, with Roomi, you&#8217;d see not only verified users but also secure in-app messaging, content moderation, and background checks! Moreover, you can subscribe to become a Roomi Gold user for only $23.99 per month or $14.99 per week. With a Roomi Gold subscription, you can upgrade your status to Fully Verified (with a badge on your profile!). This means your profile and listings will be boosted up to 7x more so you have more chances of finding your roomie quickly, and you don&#8217;t have to pay a booking fee!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust">Security: Can these apps help me find roommates I can trust?</h2>

<p>Having a roommate is ideal when moving to a new place if you want to split costs, or simply don&#8217;t want to live alone. But you have to make sure you have safe roomies with whom you feel comfortable. So, it&#8217;s best to use roommate finders that verify their users, conduct background checks, and keep your private information secure. With these features, you&#8217;ll find safe roomies in no time!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="verifies-roommate-contact-info">Verifies Roommate Contact Info</h3>



<p>Roomi uses <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002123258--qu%C3%A9-es-globalid-" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GlobalID</a> as one way to verify its user&#8217;s contact information. It&#8217;s a digital identity platform that confirms and stores a user&#8217;s email and contact information, keeping it safe and secure. Additionally, it lets you control your identity and verifications, so other people can&#8217;t access your data easily.</p>



<p>Finding roommates on Facebook may be risky because Facebook doesn&#8217;t indicate that the profiles are verified. Many listings can show up with a simple roommate search on Facebook, but it&#8217;s also possible that the contact information posted may be false.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="id-verification">ID Verification</h3>



<p>Many roommate finders similar to Facebook marketplace don&#8217;t have a verified badge on regular profiles (only businesses, official organizations, and celebrities have them). This means that you won&#8217;t be able to distinguish whether a profile was made by a real person or not. So, roommates on Facebook have the potential to be fake or scammers. But with Roomi, users go through a comprehensive verification process to ensure that all profiles are made by real people. You can even get a Fully Verified badge on your profile with a Roomi Gold subscription!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="privacy-security-of-profiles">Privacy &amp; Security of Profiles</h3>



<p>Roomi takes the private and personal information of its users seriously. For one, Roomi has secure in-app messaging, so you won&#8217;t have to worry about any leak of your private messages from the app. On top of that, once you log in to the app or website, your personal information is automatically protected under the <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002273251-deleting-my-data-under-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPDR</a>. With this, you can request your profile and data to be deleted once you&#8217;ve found your roomie.</p>



<p>In contrast, Facebook has been known to have problems when it comes to the safekeeping of the privacy and security of its users. With ever-changing privacy controls, there are many reports on Facebook users being confused about how to keep their information private on the app.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="24-7-support-content-moderation">24/7 Support &amp; Content Moderation</h3>



<p>One of the things Facebook is not known for is its content moderation because anyone with a profile can freely post anything they want on the platform. Although there&#8217;s always the option to report a listing or a post, it&#8217;s still not 100% percent clean of non-genuine listings. However, Roomi has its own in-house content moderation team responsible for picking out bad listings and clearing spam content.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="criminal-background-check">Criminal Background Check</h3>



<p>One of the many features Roomi has that makes it the best roommate finder is its criminal background checks. Upon request, Roomi does background checks against local and international criminal databases. A verified badge can be given to the user by submitting a photo of their ID. This is granted that they&#8217;re clear of any crime. With a verified badge, the chances of finding a roommate are much higher. And, with a Roomi Gold subscription, you can get a Fully Verified badge yourself!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-profiles-which-app-makes-it-easier-to-find-your-perfect-roommate">User Profiles: Which App Makes It Easier to Find Your Perfect Roommate?</h2>



<p>Your roommate search on Facebook can be tricky if you&#8217;re not entirely knowledgeable about the app itself. Since everything can be listed in Facebook marketplace, you&#8217;d have to search for what you&#8217;re looking for specifically and then choose a listing that looks trustworthy enough before inquiring. Hence, there are a lot of hoops you have to jump through when finding roommates on Facebook. On the other hand, with Roomi&#8217;s easy-to-navigate and straightforward app and website, you&#8217;ll be able to find a roommate easily!</p>



<p>In Roomi, you can use filters to fit your preferences. Like, if you prefer to live with a non-binary roommate or maybe someone a bit older than you, you just have to set the appropriate filter, and Roomi will narrow down your choices. Plus, Roomi has a roommate matching algorithm that works wonders to help you find the most appropriate roommate for you!</p>

<p>There are many roommate finders available, but only a select few can actually provide the features you need to find the best roommate. Luckily, Roomi has everything! Unlike finding roommates on Facebook where there&#8217;s no proper verification, and your security may be at risk, Roomi keeps your private information safe, has verified users, and conducts background checks. With all these features, you will have a smooth roommate-finding experience with Roomi.</p>
