										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every year, new words and phrases seep into our vocab. Though they sound weird at first, they soon become second nature. And many even make it into the Oxford English Dictionary. Strange new words from authors, and quirky acronyms from singers, come into existence. And politicians and scientists bring pre-existing words back into circulation &#8211; until many become part of our day-to-day conversations. And 2020 was no different. Many slang words come to the front in 2020, some that made sense, and others, well.</p>



<p>So, we were wondering which words had the most people searching for their definitions in 2020. What had captured our attention in the US and had us talking the most? To find out, we consulted Google Trends.</p>



<p>Here are some of the most searched definitions of slang words in 2020 across the states. Does any come as a surprise to you?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-wap">1. WAP</h2>



<p>Thanks, Cardi!</p>

<p>The acronym WAP was searched in the United States up to 1 million times per month. It reached its peak popularity in August 2020. No surprise there! This was the month that Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion released ‘WAP’. A song that spent 5 weeks at the top of the charts.</p>



<p>It’s no wonder then, that so many people confusingly searched “What does WAP mean?” to keep up with the hype. The highest levels of interest in the states lay with West Virginia, followed by Dakota and then Vermont. Out of all the words in 2020 that reigned over us, this one definitely had our heads spinning.</p>



<p>We should all know the meaning by now, but if not, feel free to read the lyrics for yourself; there’s something in there about a bucket and a mop, and macaroni in a pot!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-entanglement">2. Entanglement</h2>



<p>“I got into an entanglement with August.”</p>

<p>Famously putting a spin on the word “affair”, Jada Pinkett Smith brought the word “entanglement” into light in July 2020. This word in 2020, was reigning at 1 million searches every month. It seems the whole of the United States (and the world) was just as confused as Will Smith. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia proved to be the most interested in wtf Jada was talking about.</p>



<p>Jada opened up to her husband, Will, about how she got involved with August Alsina on her own show <em>Red Table Talk</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>August, a family friend, had apparently approached Jada for some help with issues including a drug addiction. She told Will: &#8220;I got into an entanglement with August. I was in a lot of pain, and I was very broken. In the process of that relationship, I definitely realized that you can&#8217;t find happiness outside of yourself.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-pandemic">3. Pandemic</h2>



<p>Well, duh…</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="465" height="400" data-attachment-id="5407" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/the-words-we-couldnt-stop-saying-in-2020/attachment/mask/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mask.gif?fit=465%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="465,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="mask" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mask.gif?fit=300%2C258&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mask.gif?fit=465%2C400&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mask.gif?resize=465%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5407"/></figure>



<p>There’s no 2020 blog without at least one mention of the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/can-i-leave-house-nyc-lockdown/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic</a>. And last year had us all uttering the word every day &#8211; pretty crazy since most of us wouldn’t have even considered the word “pandemic” unless we were talking about historic outbreaks like the 1918 influenza pandemic. Now, the term has infected our modern-day vocab. It’s even brought new fashion trends with it.</p>



<p>The states first began searching the word online in mid-January, with popularity taking a dramatic peak in March, before dropping slightly and staying steady throughout the year. It seems we never lost interest in the pandemic &#8211; and how could we, when it affected so much of our lives (and still does)? The states that searched for “pandemic” the most were Massacheusettes, Pennsylvania and Arizona.</p>



<p>Here’s hoping this pandemic starts making itself history this year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-simp">4. Simp</h2>



<p>The nice guy that finishes last. Sorry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-clueless-movie-26gryjW9mWxDcIQCY"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/26gryjW9mWxDcIQCY/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Clueless Movie Slang GIF by filmeditor - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>In our bid to keep up with those Tik-Tokking Gen Zs, we all began wondering what a “simp” was in December 2019. However, searches for the term shot up in March 2020 and still to this day, the search “what does simp mean” garners a heap of interest in the United States. Mostly, this obsession with simps resides in Alaska, Hawaii and Utah.</p>



<p>Still confused? Maybe wondering if you yourself would be regarded as a simp?</p>



<p>Put simply, a “simp” is the Gen Z version of the infamous Nice Guy. Urban Dictionary puts it quite simply: “Someone who does way too much for a person they like.” And, usually, this attraction isn’t reciprocated, and the so-called “simp” doesn’t get the person they want &#8211; despite their efforts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-bipoc">5. BIPOC</h2>



<p>A more inclusive acronym.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="381" data-attachment-id="5409" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/the-words-we-couldnt-stop-saying-in-2020/attachment/blm/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blm.gif?fit=500%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,381" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="blm" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blm.gif?fit=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blm.gif?fit=500%2C381&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blm.gif?resize=500%2C381&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5409"/></figure>



<p>“BIPOC” went from virtually zero interest to a surge in internet searches in June 2020 -shortly after George Floyd was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis. BIPOC stands for “black, Indigenous, and people of color” and the acronym was coined for a more inclusive and respectful way to refer to black Americans.</p>



<p>In the long-overdue conversations around Black Lives Matter, BIPOC became a talking point &#8211; mostly in Vermont, Oregon and the District of Columbia.&nbsp;<br>However, reaction to the term wasn’t always favorable. Sylvia Obell, host of Netflix podcast ‘<em>Okay, Now Listen’, </em>said “It is lazy to lump us all together as if we all face the same problems. When you blend us all together like this, it’s erasure. It allows people to get away with not knowing people of color and our separate set of issues that we all face.”</p>

<p>A global pandemic, constant quarantines, country-wide lockdowns. Then followed by anxiety, loneliness, existential thoughts, frustration. The norm of 2020 is quite bizarre and difficult to accept. It&#8217;s all so overwhelming that it be really difficult to make your quarantine productive. But among others, podcast creators have been using their creativity to help listeners get through these strange times. These quarantine podcasts have save us all during these uncertain times. So, to help our readers, we&#8217;ve decided to make a list of our podcast picks for the pandemic.</p>



<p>Some new podcasts had experts helping listeners through various issues, and some well-established ones experimented with pandemic topics. Make your extended alone time at home interesting with our picks of pop-up pandemic podcasts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Our Plague Year</h2>



<p>Now, this had to be the first of our podcast picks for the pandemic. The creator describes this current-events pop-up podcast as “an experiment in public anxiety.” The talks on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ourplagueyear.libsyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our Plague Year</a> offer peeks into the lives of regular people living through quarantines and lockdowns, helping listeners <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/8-quarantine-activities-to-unleash-the-artist-in-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survive the pandemic</a> together. As the podcast bio states, “it’s a scary year, but it doesn’t have to be scary alone.” This is one of those quarantine podcasts that is a great way to draw comfort in many spaces.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Introverts Guide to The Good Life</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re an introvert, this would be one of the best quarantine podcasts for you. This podcast always talked about the different types of social (and home) lives, mostly from <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-expert-tips-co-living-extrovert-roommate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introverts’ perspectives</a>. Once the quarantines started  cases of loneliness and anxiety increased. So, as a result, Nerdette released related episodes on the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/8-minutes-of-joy/1ab6d5f1-b553-4ac1-a65a-e7d6ad998ce0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Introvert’s Guide to The Good Life</a> podcast.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Science Vs</h2>



<p><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science Vs</a>’s specialty has always been Debunking myths and offering well-researched scientific explanations in layman&#8217;s terms. When the coronavirus broke out, the team wasted no time in collecting questions and giving the listeners the correct fact-based answers. The questions range from “Do I disinfect EVERYTHING?” to “Was it made in a lab?” to “Protesting in a pandemic.” On every episode, you can listen to different experts talking about what they know best. So, make your quarantine intellectually productive with this podcast!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Home Cooking</h2>



<p>All we had were the odd collection of kitchen rations when the first lockdown was announced. Our creativity in the kitchen <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/cooking-in-quarantine-expectations-vs-reality-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been tested extensively</a> during these weeks in quarantine. So, chef Samin Nosrat took questions on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://linktr.ee/homecooking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home Cooking</a> podcast and suggested delicious recipes that use the bare minimum. Listeners found <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/lazy-roomi-cooking-9-recipes-for-slow-lazy-days-roomi/">easy recip</a><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/lazy-roomi-cooking-9-recipes-for-slow-lazy-days-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">es and answers to their individual tricky situation. For example, one caller </a>had a vegan roommate and a meat-loving partner. While another had stocked a massive quantity of beans. The episodes are also full of ridiculous puns and infectious laughter! Trust us when we say this is one of the best quarantine podcasts out there! So, make your quarantine productive with Samin Nosrat!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The Kids Are All…Home</h2>



<p>True to its name, <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://pineapple.fm/stuck-at-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">The Kids Are All…Home</a> is exactly what parents of young children are looking for. These episodes are made for children – to keep them entertained and their imaginations active. The creators describe the podcast aptly as a “podcast for kids with nothing to do, by kids with nothing to do.” So, the episodes explore the creativity of kids with the help of wacky questions (and wackier answers), made-up scenarios, derailing conversations, and more. This is certainly the most creative one on our list of podcast picks for the pandemic. So, make your kids&#8217; make your quarantine productive with this podcast!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whether you&#8217;re already in a long-distance relationship and currently dating someone or single and swiping away on dating apps, having to self isolate thanks to the pandemic has been especially tricky for our love lives. While still respecting the safe at home order, it is only natural to feel a little antsy to not to be able to go out and see people. Well, this is where one has to start thinking of virtual date ideas.</p>



<p>We are sure the bars and the parks miss you, but just because you can’t go out on outdoor dates and see each other in person, doesn’t mean you can’t build relationships from the comfort of your house.</p>



<p>This could also be the perfect time to not only get to know someone on a deeper level but also introspect and further invest in your existing relationships.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick list of some fun activities you can do with someone when you’re not physically in the same space. A lot of these things could also be done with your friends and family; they don&#8217;t have to be specific to romantic or sexual partners.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Virtual date ideas for gamers! </h2>



<p>There are so many different kinds of games out there, both competitive and cooperative. Be it easy breezy and accessible fun mobile games or serious sit-down PC / console gaming, the possibilities are endless!</p>



<p>A lot of games that you play online together don&#8217;t involve speaking to each other, so a video call is a good way to carry on communicating whilst you’re playing the game.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse">Make it more fun by adding your own twists to it, such as the person who wins a game gets to ask the other person a challenging question or give them a dare.</pre>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Virtual date ideas for your inner nerd!</h2>



<p>Make a book club! Read a book together and then organize a time to have a video call to discuss the said book. Consuming the same things together and discussing them is a great way to connect with your partner. Reading to each other is also a great virtual date because it can inspire thoughtful conversations.</p>



<p>You can experiment with a book, an article, or even a podcast episode! Taking an online personality test or relationship quizzes together is not only entertaining, but the results could be very amusing too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Netflix and….party?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.netflixparty.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix Party</a> (or Teleparty) is a chrome extension that allows you to watch content simultaneously while texting on the little chat box that appears.</p>



<p>And it is always a good idea to either have an audio or a video call or even plain texting to make sure its a conjoint experience.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Groovy virtual date ideas!</h2>



<p>This one’s for all the music lovers out there &#8211; Create a joint playlist!</p>



<p>You can create private playlists that you both have access to, can add songs to, and listen to at the same time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Get back to the classics</h2>



<p>Cooking and eating dinner together over video calls and the quintessential dinner dates never gets old. To spice things up, you can also decide to buy the same ingredients and plan what you’re going to cook. You could also get adventurous and order a surprise meal for each other.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Warning:</strong> Not for picky eaters.</pre>

<p>Karaoke night is our favorite! Get some tunes up on YouTube, put your video call on, have a few drinks, and burst into song! Also, a good day to put on your favorite concert outfit and dance your heart out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Pop open a bottle!</h2>



<p>Wine nights are a must if you&#8217;re going to try out one of these virtual date ideas. Sorry, we did not make the rules. Hop onto Zoom or FaceTime and pour a glass of wine and talk about anything and everything. Don’t be afraid to get a little tipsy for a little wine helps to loosen up the conversation like nothing else can.</p>

<p>Last but definitely not least, make sure to treat it like a real date! Just because you’re alone in your room doesn’t make it any less of a date. Dress up in something that makes you feel confident and don&#8217;t forget to have fun y&#8217;all!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Staying indoors for long periods of time can be awfully stressful. Especially in today&#8217;s age where we&#8217;re all used to our fast-paced life of oversaturation. The lockdowns imposed across the world forced us all to find new things to do with our time. And some of the questions we found ourselves pondering over were: <br>What do we do with our time in self-isolation? How can we take this time to nurture the best versions of ourselves? And how can we hack self-development through creativity?</p>



<p>It’s important to stay informed about the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/2020/03/17/things-to-know-nyc-coronavirus-pandemic/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronavirus pandemic in New York</a>. But it’s also important to stay sane and find new ways to entertain yourself while you’re in self-isolation. At Roomi, we’re trying to remain positive about the slightly crazy, confusing times we’re living in. Some of us have also taken this time to achieve those levels of self-development that we always desired. </p>



<p>We’re also taking this as an opportunity to hang out with our flatmates. Reconnect with our inner creative, and finding new things to watch from across the world!</p>



<p>If you can feel boredom knocking on your (closed) apartment door, here are some of the ways to spend your self-isolation in creativity and work towards some self-development.</p>

<p>With jobs being cut and hours being reduced across the state, many New Yorkers are left twiddling their thumbs at home. This is a perfect time to take that online training course you’ve been thinking about for months. Whether just for self-development or to earn a certificate that looks good on your LinkedIn profile, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/sharpen-your-professional-skills-in-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">take advantage of all this spare time to work on your professional portfolio</a>.</p>



<p>Right now, some major organizations are offering free or cheaper courses to help keep us motivated during the pandemic. This is also a highly productive way of spending your time while you&#8217;re self-isolating.</p>

<p>Staying indoors means fewer visits to the grocery store. It&#8217;s also true that many of us are starting to appreciate the value of a sustainable lifestyle. Use this opportunity to start a veggie patch or herb garden! These additions don&#8217;t just add color and flavor to your dishes, they actually save money in the long-run. </p>



<p>You’ll find plenty of advice online, so even if you’re limited to the tight space of a balcony, there are plants, herbs, and vegetables you can successfully grow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Express your creativity through writing, reading, or painting!</h2>

It’s easy to switch off and let ourselves be distracted by devices, but you probably need a break from the news and media.</p>



<p>Breathe a new lease of life into your self-isolation routine by going back to the creative activities you used to love as a kid. Whether it’s writing poetry or literature, creating masterpieces on canvas, or getting lost in a book, grab some paper and your favorite tool and start exploring your creative side.

<p>Want to order pasta in Italian or learn the language of love? This is your chance! Learning a new language not only helps you navigate the world more easily (and impress your friends.) But it also makes you more employable. If there’s one thing we’ve learned during the pandemic, is that emotions and feelings transcend language. So why not pick up a new language as a hobby, too?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep moving, even when you&#8217;re in self-isolation.</h2>

<p>The gym might be a no-go zone, but it’s important to get your daily exercise. You’re allowed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html" class="broken_link">exercise outdoors in New York</a>, as long as you maintain a six-foot distance from other people. So there’s no need to deny yourself the simple pleasure of jogging or walking.</p>



<p>If you prefer to stay indoors, launch YouTube to find some home workouts or yoga routines. And if you’re short on exercise equipment, use your creativity to improvise and turn cans of food into weights! Keep moving by vacuuming and gardening too &#8211; do whatever it takes to keep your muscles healthy and blood pumping.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning an instrument is yet another effective tool for self-development.</h2>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter you’ve never picked up an instrument in your life. Or your electronic keyboard has been gathering dust for years. Inject some music back into your day-to-day lifestyle and learn to play an instrument. Learning to play a musical instrument is a fantastic stress-reliever and could even improve your memory.</p>



<p>Living with roomis? Give them a heads up about your musical instrument endeavors! And be sure to keep the noise down after 10 p.m., or earlier if they ask.</p>
