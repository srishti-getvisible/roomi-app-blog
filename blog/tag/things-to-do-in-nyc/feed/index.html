<p>If you&#8217;ve seen 2 Broke Girls, you&#8217;ll know all about living on a shoestring budget. Living on a budget might be challenging, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you have to sacrifice your style. Thrifting is a fantastic way to shop on a budget while still finding cool items. As honorary members of “B.F.F: Your Broke Friend Forever” club, we&#8217;ll walk you through thrifting in Brooklyn with Max and Caroline and list out the best thrift stores in Brooklyn.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Broadway Fashion</h2>



<p>Broadway Fashion, located in the heart of Bushwick, is our top choice for secondhand stores in Brooklyn. Head here to pick up some of your wardrobe&#8217;s fundamental staples without spending a lot of money.</p>



<p>This shop sells both men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s clothing, and as a bonus, they also sell a variety of shoes and sneakers. While you won&#8217;t find anything high-end here, this place is as budget-friendly as it gets. You may find items for as little as $6, but take your time because there&#8217;s a lot to choose from. This is where you&#8217;ll find Max and Caroline trying to save their money.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New Brooklyn Fashion</h2>



<p>A hidden treasure and a fantastic place for thrifting in Brooklyn. This is also located in Bushwick and few blocks away from Broadway Fashion. If you&#8217;re searching for a great price and wide selection, start your tour of Brooklyn thrift stores here.</p>



<p>This store specializes in women&#8217;s clothes (dresses, blouses, and shirts), and has a big selection of vivid and colorful apparel for all seasons &#8211; especially spring and summer. They also have a small section for men&#8217;s clothes, mostly t-shirts, and jeans.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Beacon’s Closet</h2>



<p>On Bogart Street, Beacon&#8217;s Closet has been a long-standing New York City store, for its vast on-trend assortment of apparel, shoes, and accessories. Beacon&#8217;s Closet buys, sells, and trades antique and current apparel, recreating the most realistic concept of a thrift-shop emporium. What&#8217;s more, many of its apparel products are under or very near to $20. It&#8217;s the ideal location for a shopping spree, but first, find yourself a basket without a snow cone in it :P.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">L Train Vintage</h2>



<p>Max and Caroline&#8217;s first stop for vintage outfits would be Broadway Fashion. On the even cheaper end of vintage clothes thrifting in Brooklyn, there&#8217;s L Train Vintage, one of the city&#8217;s most famous thrift stores. With many things under $10 and a well-curated assortment of clothes and accessories, L Train is perhaps the most affordable vintage thrift store in Brooklyn.</p>



<p>L Train has several sites around Brooklyn and offers the denim-heavy apparel choices of any thrift store. They have a lot of denim jeans and jackets on the shelves. Not only that, but L Train in Brooklyn also provides a good assortment of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s vintage clothes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buffalo Exchange</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s no better place to hunt for bargains than Buffalo Exchange, a renowned countrywide second-hand store. Buffalo has a number of sites throughout Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens.</p>



<p>Buffalo is one of the greatest thrift stores in Brooklyn to visit for a wide range of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s apparel. There are both high-end and low-end clothes available. Both old and brand new.</p>



<p>This store also does a fantastic job of stocking clothes for all four seasons. They have everything you need, whether it&#8217;s warm comforting sweaters or a pretty sundress.</p>



<p>Another unique thing about them is that they also let you schedule an appointment on their website to sell goods from your own wardrobe. You may either earn cash or trade it in for discounted shop products. To enhance your chances of selling or exchanging, call ahead and inquire about what styles they are currently buying.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Monk Vintage</h2>



<p>This second-hand store is a famous Brooklyn vintage destination on Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg.</p>



<p>Monk Vintage has a wonderfully curated collection of Brooklyn old clothes and more than any other store. For me, it&#8217;s the perfect combination of vintage and current clothing.</p>



<p>In addition, in and around the checkout area, this business offers artwork, antiques, and old movie posters. And as another added bonus, you can also donate your unwanted items or outdated designs and get a 25% discount on your next purchase by doing so.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of the show, How I Met Your Mother, then you&#8217;re familiar with the gang&#8217;s primary hangout spot: MacLaren&#8217;s Pub. This bar was even based on a real life bar in NYC known as McGee&#8217;s. So, if you liked seeing Barney Stinson and friends having quality time at their &#8216;pub&#8217;, then here are some pubs in NYC that may be a good fit for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pubs in NYC: The Bronx</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. McDermott&#8217;s Pub</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re living in NYC, you&#8217;ve most likely heard of McDermott&#8217;s Pub in the Bronx. This is one of the bars in NYC that is certainly not lacking in customers. It has proven to be a great place to watch sports, play bar games, eat food that will tingle your taste buds, and enjoy beer and cocktails. This pub is a perfect meeting spot for groups, just like the one Barney Stinson and the gang enjoyed in How I Met Your Mother.</p>

<p>Not many bars in NYC are located close to the Staten Island Ferry, which is why this is one of the coolest New York pubs. They offer great service and beer, and even have a jukebox! Events like Martini Madness, Happy Hour, and Karaoke night will be sure to spice up your night.</p>



<p><strong>Timings</strong>: Monday to Saturday: 11 a.m &#8211; 3 a.m.<br>Sunday: 12 p.m &#8211; 3 a.m</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Watch Toggenburg Goats graze in Queens</h2>

<p>Spanning over 47 acres in Glen Oaks, <a href="http://queensfarm.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Queen&#8217;s County Farm Museum</a> is the longest continuous farmed site in the state, dating back to 1697.</p>



<p>The farm is open seven days a week, all year round for the interested and curious to come to visit and see how the farm operates, to see the animals &#8211; which include the two Dexter steers, the smallest cattle breeds in the world at 900 pounds, sheep, two heritage breed pigs, laying hens, Italian honeybees, and a mix of Nubian, Toggenburg, Lamancha, and — as of 2016 — Saanen goats!</p>



<p>During fall, you can also catch the pick-your-own pumpkin patch and a corn maze that&#8217;s shaped like a Unisphere.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Become a beekeeper! ?</h2>

<p>All you need to do is register your hive with the city.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Canoe through the Gowanus Canal</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/TheThing_Movie_NVergalla_08-e1595531322804.jpg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="gowanus-dredgers-paddle-in-movie"/><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/24/nycs-gowanus-canal-now-a-pandemic-safe-venue-for-summer-fun/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The best thing about the Gowanus Canal, outside the looks it serves, is that the&nbsp;<a href="https://gowanuscanal.org/self-guided-voyages" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Gowanus Dredgers</a>&nbsp;lend out three-person boats which are cleaned between each use, that too for free on most Wednesdays from 6-8 p.m. and Saturdays from 1-5 p.m. so that guests can explore the estuary at their own speed on a half-hour self-guided paddle!</p>



<p>This is one of the most fun things to take up in NYC on a weekend, especially when you feel like exploring the gritty waterway infrastructure of the canal. And learn about the canal that was infamously named after Gouwane, a Lenape chief — and the variety of industrial buildings that dot its banks. For those wondering, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://nypost.com/2020/07/24/nycs-gowanus-canal-now-a-pandemic-safe-venue-for-summer-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gowanus Canal is also a COVID safe venue now!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Visit a Naval Cemetery turned walkway</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brooklyngreenway.org/wp-content/uploads/170716_21-06-51__Y9A8884.jpg?fit=1200%2C696&amp;ssl=1" alt="Naval Cemetery Landscape at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, on the best things to visit and do in the outdoors of NYC"/></figure>



<p>After staying indoors in New York for even a couple of months, you best bet that all popular parks and spots. Prospect Park, Herbert Von King, and Central Park’s Ramble are going to be particularly overdone. So when it comes to NYC outdoors, the Naval Cemetery Landscape at the Brooklyn Navy Yard &#8211; which reopened in 2016 with new walkways and plants after being shut for close to a century &#8211; become perfect exploration spots.</p>



<p>Other similar places include the Heather Garden, a steeply done three-acre piece of Fort Tryon Park!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Count birds and stars at the roof of the Jarvits Center</h2>



<p>The convention center boasts a 6.75-acre green roof where visitors can see up to 29 species of birds. in the past, enthusiasts have photographed Canada geese, American Kestrels, herring gulls, great black-backed gulls, mourning doves, and northern mockingbirds, among others. Others include three honeybee hives and five different bat species.</p>



<p>This space also helps reduce energy consumption in the convention center through its r<a href="https://www.greenroofs.com/projects/jacob-k-javits-convention-center/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">egulation of roof temperature</a>. They also provide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.javitscenter.com/sustainability/green-roof-tours/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">free tours</a>&nbsp;via appointments only.</p>
