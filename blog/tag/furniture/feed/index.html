<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting started</h2>



<p>Before you step out and spend those precious dollars, here are a few things to keep in mind. You will need to shell out some cash to decorate your off-campus housing. Hence, be sure that what you buy is going to fit your student apartment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="12924" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/decorate-off-campus-housing-on-a-budget/attachment/home-decor-couch-cushion/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2560,1707" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="home-decor-couch-cushion" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="a grey couch with blue cushions" class="wp-image-12924" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Budget</h3>



<p>It can be easy to get carried away while decorating your off campus housing. Dorms and campus housing may have restrictions when it comes to decoration or modifications. However, off campus housing is a lot more flexible. Be sure that you set a budget and do not spend on unnecessary items or furniture. Remember you can always buy something later if you still feel that you really want it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Available space</h3>



<p>Do you really need that 50 inch T.V. or that huge fluffy rug? Don&#8217;t get carried away when you shop. And be realistic. Make sure what you buy will actually fit in your off campus housing, and is practical. There is still a lot you can do if you are working with a small space. However, be sure you don&#8217;t overdo it and end up with a cluttered apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pets</h3>



<p>Having a pet is a commitment that you need to take seriously. Thus, be sure that you have your furry friend in mind while decorating and furnishing your off campus housing. Make sure that you are creating an environment that is safe and comfortable for your pet. Also, keep in mind that you need a place for your pet to sleep and relieve themselves! Shedding can also be something that you need to plan for, to avoid a mess. Fragile decorations on open shelves can also be a disaster. Ask yourself if the things you are buying are going to be a problem.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Aesthetic</h3>



<p>It is easy to see something pretty and spring for it in the spur of the moment. However, do consider if what you are buying will actually fit your aesthetic and that of your off campus housing. The last thing that you want, is to buy something and then realize that you really don&#8217;t like it that much. Hence, be sure to set the vibe you want to go for!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Practicality and mindfulness</h3>



<p>While you may really think that fancy ceramic shot glass set will really up your house party game, hold on. When you&#8217;re on a budget, be careful of your temptation to spring for fancier and more pricey versions of things. Don&#8217;t fall for marketing and end up going beyond your means! However, this doesn&#8217;t mean you should always buy cheaper and low-quality items. Being mindful is the key here. Before buying something, ask yourself. Is this going to add value to me or my space?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buying furniture</h2>



<p>If you are moving into an unfurnished off campus housing, then the first thing you&#8217;ll need to buy is furniture. Get started with a list of things you will need to furnish your off campus apartment. Make sure that you are getting everything and not less, and definitely not more. Again, remember, that mahogany shelf may look great in the corner, but do you really need it?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to get?</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s start off with the essentials. You will need a bed and mattress to start off. A solid and comfortable study desk and chair is also a good investment. Beyond this, it really depends on the size and nature of your off campus housing. If you are living in a studio apartment, you may want to keep it limited and only get a small couch or coffee table. However, if you are moving into a bigger space and sharing it, you may want to get a larger couch and table for your common spaces.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where to get it?</h3>



<p>For furniture, you may want to check out <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">IKEA</a>. This basically your one-stop shop for all your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/affordable-furniture-shops-when-living-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">furniture needs</a>! Other than this, you can visit local stores and look for deals as well. Buying used furniture online is also a great option. You can often find great deals on used furniture that can save you a decent buck. Remember, these are things that you will use regularly and need to last you a while. Hence, take your time and do your share of window shopping.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buying applicances and decoration</h2>



<p>After you&#8217;ve got yourself the essentials with a full set of furniture, appliances and accessories are next. This is the place where you should exercise your fair share of caution. It can be easy to splurge too much on these items. Be sure you are getting what you need, and that it adds value to your space and life.</p>

<p>Again, this can widely vary depending on your lifestyle and the size of your off campus housing. If you are going to be cooking at home, a fridge and stove are going to be essential. Beyond this, you can get a microwave, blender or oven depending on the kind of cooking you do. If you are going to be eating out or in your college mess, you may want to skip this all. Ask yourself if you need a television and if you and your flat mates are actually going to using it. When it comes to decoration, keep all the earlier tips in mind, and consult with your roommates if you have any.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where to get it?</h3>



<p>You can look to <a href="https://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart</a> or <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/?intl=nosplash" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Bestbuy</a> to find appliances and other decorations. They usually have a large selection and decent prices. You can also look to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> and easily find great deals online as well. Try <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Etsy</a> for handmade and more personalized decor and art. Again, be sure to check with local stores for deals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whether you&#8217;re just <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/is-moving-to-new-york-city-for-me-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">moving to New York</a>, or have been living in NYC and wish to redecorate without burning a hole in your wallet, you might be on the hunt for affordable furniture for your apartment.</p>



<p>We feel your struggle! So we want to help you find the best furniture on a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-tips-on-how-to-save-money-while-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">budget when living in NYC.</a></p>



<p>Having said that, we also believe that furniture is a tricky investment. Only saving money shouldn&#8217;t be your priority. While affordable furniture is feasible, you need to put in the right amount of research that matches your budget but also doesn&#8217;t wear down in a couple of months.</p>



<p>So while you try and buy furniture on the cheaper side, you should be willing to give a price for something that will sit well in your apartment and last long, even when you have to move out.</p>



<p>So go for something affordable, yet sturdy and be willing to save for a later buy instead of buying cheap and bad quality furniture in a hurry.</p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s get to it. Here are some of the best places you can find your dream furniture on a budget when living in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">NEW FURNITURE</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. IKEA</h3>



<p>Chances are you are tired of shopping from IKEA and wish to move beyond it. But the thing is when it comes to cheap and sturdy furniture, IKEA is one of the best bets for people living in NYC looking to spend less. The assembling of the furniture is hard work, yes, but if saving money is what you&#8217;re looking at, IKEA would surely top the list.</p>



<p>Think of it like this, you could make it a fun activity to do with your roomis!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Macy&#8217;s clearance sales</h3>



<p>Looking for something affordable yet stylish and fun? Reddit users living in NYC suggest Macy&#8217;s clearance as a money-saving option for good quality furniture.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dubadub/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit user dubadub</a> says</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Macy&#8217;s is the super-secret money saver. Having a Macy&#8217;s card and finding a good sale saves 50-90% off list on good stuff.</em></p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kkkkat/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit user kkkat</a> backs this up by saying</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Depends on what you buy. They have good sales if you time it right. We got 2 large mid century style sofas for 600 each. They&#8217;re comfortable and stylish. Everyone constantly asks where I got them.

</div>
</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Article</h3>



<p>Averagely priced online furniture store <a href="https://www.article.com/browse/14/bedroom-beds" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Article</a> has a good collection of affordable furniture and has an excellent return policy for people living in NYC.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>The Article couch? Yes, it was pretty good. I ended up returning it since the color didn&#8217;t work with my room (they have an excellent return policy FYI!). I ordered the blue velvet Sven sofa. It was worth what I paid for it. Looked very pretty.</em></p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">USED FURNITURE</h2>



<p>We know what you&#8217;re thinking. BED BUGS! And yes, they can be found on wooden furniture apart from your beds too. While that&#8217;s a risk, there are many ways you can prevent or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/avoid-mutating-bed-bugs-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid bed bugs</a> when buying used furniture.</p>



<p>So if you find affordable furniture, don&#8217;t run away thinking the bed bugs will bite. Just thoroughly inspect and follow rules of bed bug prevention and cure and bring home furniture that you fall in love with!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Craigslist</h3>



<p>When living in NYC, if you&#8217;re lucky you might find furniture on Craigslist that has been barely used and can adorn your apartment like no other!</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/man_with_cat2/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit user man_with_cat2</a> says</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Craigslist. Furniture seems to depreciate at least 50% the moment it&#8217;s used.

<p>Another used furniture buying and selling platform, <a href="http://aptdeco.com">Aptdeco.com</a> has great deals on offer when it comes to affordable furniture when living in NYC! And what&#8217;s more! Their delivery team inspects for bed bugs too! They elaborate on this in their <a href="https://help.aptdeco.com/buying" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ section on their website</a>,</p>



<p><strong><em>During the inspection, the delivery team also checks for bed bugs. If they find any signs of bed bugs, which is extremely rare, then we&#8217;ll cancel the sale and notify the buyer immediately.</em></strong></p>

</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Kaiyo</h3>



<p>And if you&#8217;re on the lookout for furniture stores that can provide a Certificate of Insurance for your building management when living in NYC, you should check <a href="https://kaiyo.com/faq/#what-happens-if-the-items-i-ordered-are-too-big-for-my-building" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Kaiyo</a> out.</p>



<p>Moreover, they also ensure industrial cleaning for the used affordable furniture you choose to buy, and being an eco-conscious furniture store, they claim to plant a tree for every purchase made!</p>



<p>And while we were scouting for Reddit comments that could support our suggestions, here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mister_foobar/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">mister_foobar</a> who made us chuckle with his comment.</p>
