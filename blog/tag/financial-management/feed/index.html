<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests knowing what you exactly want in terms of accommodation when living on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re going to spend the most on rent and it&#8217;s not going to be frugal. You just have to be honest with yourself about what you want and you&#8217;re going to have to pay for it. The more roommates you have, the less you&#8217;ll pay. So remember that when you chart your living expenses budget in New York.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hyperside89 says you need to accept that rent is going to be your highest expense</h3>



<p>Rent is going to be your highest expense. Accept it, don&#8217;t fret over it. Some people will tell you to live in a place you don&#8217;t feel safe, or to cram 5 people in a two bedroom apartment to save money (slight exaggeration). Don&#8217;t do it. If your home is a place you want to be you&#8217;ll spend more time there, aka not being out spending money. I just spend the entire Sunday in my apartment cooking, reading, etc. Didn&#8217;t spend a dime. My rent is $1,100 a month (+ $40-60 on utilities) and so worth it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests moving to Manhattan for living on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>Move to Manhattan My BF and I live in the UWS and are moving next month. We have signed papers for a place in Harlem &#8211; it is up and coming and super convenient train-wise. Safe and very neighborhood-y. We will only be spending $1500 for a 1BR which is SUPER CHEAP. We will be able to afford to buy a used car soon and parking is also affordable up there. I love the neighborhood and it is totally worth looking into for living on a budget in New York.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage speaks the truth about commuting on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re going to spend the same amount on the subway as everyone else and there&#8217;s also nothing you can do about it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user Artichokeowl suggests knowing for sure how often you&#8217;d <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hacks-to-the-subway-in-nyc-we-all-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the subway</a></h3>



<p>One thing that helps is thinking about how often you will really need to take the subway or bus. If you know for SURE that you&#8217;ll need to take it to and from work/school every single day, go for the monthly pass. If you think you&#8217;ll take it less often, decide how you want to do it by figuring out how much you pay per trip given how often you take the subway with the different metrocard options. This is the best way to live on a budget in New York.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests Brooklyn for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/frugal-living-how-to-get-groceries-on-a-budget-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">grocery shopping</a></h3>



<p>If you go to deep Brooklyn for your groceries you&#8217;ll save soooooo much money. It&#8217;s awesome how cheap it is.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests Trader Joe&#8217;s</h3>



<p>Really worth the wait because every other place seems overpriced when living on a budget in New York. Just buy a granny cart and play sudoku on your phone. For the two of us, I only spend ~$120/month there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hyperside89 says cooking will save you tons of money</h3>



<p>Cook to live on a budget in New York. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/10-life-lessons-learned-from-cooking-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cooking</a> will save you SO MUCH MONEY. Don&#8217;t even worry about seeking out the cheapest groceries in the city. I shop at my local grocery store which has average prices and I only pay $180 a month in groceries. Don&#8217;t go crazy on caviar, etc and don&#8217;t go to Whole Foods for everything and you&#8217;ll be fine. For context, I do eat a primarily vegetarian / vegan diet heavy on veggies but not exclusively.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz also suggests cooking instead of eating out or ordering in</h3>



<p>Honestly, the food sucks for the price anyway. If my $50 meal was $20, I would buy it. But it&#8217;s actually $50 and very overpriced. I spend my money on nice food I cook at home. We eat out at quality restaurants once or twice a month. That way we sample a bunch of places and really look forward to it when living on a budget in New York.</p>



<p>On the same note, no take out.&nbsp;Resist. Save for snowy days when you are sick and there is a HIMYM marathon on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fitting everything else in your budget in New York</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests their choice of money saving apps and other financial management tips</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There are AMAZING <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-best-money-saving-apps-to-reach-your-finance-goals/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">apps for saving money</a> on various nyc happenings and restaurants. ScoutMob and Savored are my favorites for living on a budget in New York.</li>



<li>Drink before you go out if you want to save money on going out. Don&#8217;t go to places with cover charges.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s not easy to live on a budget in New York. But if you want to live here, you&#8217;ll make it work. Who needs a retirement fund anyway?</li>



<li>Edit: also Amazon Prime for all your shopping</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests investing in memberships</h3>



<p>I roller skate, enjoy French films and picnics during the summer. Thus, I purchase loyalty/membership cards to the rink and film festivals. I enjoy these things and buy them at rates so I can do them often, on the cheap. It is important to do things you enjoy and spend your money right when you&#8217;re living on a budget in New York.</p>

<p>Honest you CAN live within your budget in New York. My suggestion is to really really save as much as possible. Put away as much as you can. A job is really important to have once you get here because if you don&#8217;t you will eat into your savings damn fast. Happened to me. Had a place but couldn&#8217;t get a job for around 2-3 months. Really hard on my savings.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s super possible! It can just be hard.</p>



<p>Quick breakdown of my expenses per month:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rent: $560</li>



<li>Utilities: $75-$100</li>



<li>Phone: $100</li>



<li>Metro: $120</li>



<li>Food: $150-$200</li>
</ul>



<p>Some months are better than others. Sometimes I get lucky and make my payments on time, other times no. So don&#8217;t be afraid or ashamed to ask for help if you need it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you’re a young entrepreneur, you already know that running a business is risky. It’s the nature of the game. Honestly, that’s part of the thrill. But sometimes when you’re young, ambitious and enterprising, you might also think that you’re invincible. You might think, “<em>Of course, running a business is risky, but the worst will never happen to me! I know what I’m doing!”</em>. And while being confident is good, necessary even, it’s even better to be prepared. Especially <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-financial-lessons-to-master-under-age-30-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">financially</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-financial-management-and-why-is-it-important-for-you">What is financial management and why is it important for you?</h2>



<p>Financial management is the backbone of every business. You cannot run a business, at least not a successful one, if you don’t learn how to manage finances well. That’s how companies go bankrupt and are forced to dissolve. Of course, that’s a risk you’re taking every time you think of running a business. However, there are steps you can take to mitigate financial trouble and avoid that very outcome. Which is where financial <em>risk</em> management comes into play. We know, all these words are enough to induce anxiety, but don’t worry!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-s-some-tangible-things-you-can-do-to-get-started-on-financial-risk-management">Here’s some tangible things you can do to get started on financial risk management-</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Identify any and all of your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.eaglebusinesscredit.com/blog/understanding-credit-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit risks</a> as soon as you can. This way you’re one step ahead of any potential disasters and can sidestep easily.</li>



<li>Avoid loans and unknown financiers as much as you can, this will really help you in the long run.</li>



<li>Make sure you pay off your outstanding debts and balances in a timely manner.</li>



<li>Make sure you have reliable payment records in place.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>See, that’s not so hard, is it?</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-golden-rule-of-financial-risk-management-have-a-plan-b">The golden rule of financial risk management: Have a Plan B</h2>



<p>We know this sounds like a cop-out, but trust us, it’s anything but! Having a backup plan is the sign of an entrepreneur who knows what they’re doing. Think about it, would you want to work for someone whose ambition has given them tunnel vision or do you want a pragmatic leader who’s thought of every possible outcome and prepared for the worst? Yeah, that’s what we thought.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/202006/bill-shapiro/pivot-plan-b-failure-strategy-twitter-slack-youtube.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">plan B</a> truly saves your business when things start going south. And trust us, things will go south at some point, that’s just how it is. But it’s all about how you recuperate from those failures that will define your career. So, get thinking about your plan B!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-all-about-the-work-work-work-work-work">It’s all about the work, work, work, work, work!</h2>



<p>So, now that you’re an entrepreneur, you really should get comfy with doing market research and cuz that’s your life now! Of course, when your business grows, you can get more and more people on-board to help you out here. But till then, this is your job.</p>



<p>Doing your market research is such an important part of the job, we can’t possibly stress this enough. How much impact your business has is directly related to how detailed your market research was. After all, a shocking <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-white/most-businesses-fail-why-investing-in-the-right-id.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">percentage</a> of businesses fail because there just wasn’t any demand for their product in the market. This market research will also help you come up with a solid and sustainable business plan. This, of course, directly helps with financial risk management and helps grow the business in the long run.</p>



<p>Incorporating data collected via <a href="https://www.uniqode.com/qr-code-generator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniqode&#8217;s QR code generator</a> also enables smarter financial forecasting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learn-how-to-weigh-the-odds">Learn how to weigh the odds</h2>



<p>By now you can already gauge how much of being a young entrepreneur is just assessing risks. Risk assessment is of course not an exact science and no one can ever precisely predict the outcome of a business decision. However, you can certainly take calculated risks while minimizing losses. When you’re starting out it can be hard to know instinctively which risks are important and which ones can be pushed aside for a while. This is where a simple pen and paper will help. Write down all the possible risks and their outcomes.</p>



<p>Once you have all the information, it’s easy to assess which ones are important and have to be dealt with immediately and which ones can be left in the back burner for a while. That’s how you come up with a proper strategy to be fully prepared. And that’s essentially what financial risk management is all about. Having a good strategy and exit plan to deal with any financial fallout in the future.</p>

<p>Handling finances is one of those aspects of adult life that no one really formally teaches you about. It’s right up there with other adulting mysteries like filing your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/guide-to-filing-taxes-as-a-college-student/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taxes </a>and deciding what to eat for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/lazy-roomi-cooking-9-recipes-for-slow-lazy-days-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner</a>. But nevertheless, it’s an important skill to have if you want to set yourself up for a good life. So, to help you get better at managing your finances, we’re going to deal with a pretty serious-sounding topic: investment. We know, we know, investing sounds like something only fancy Wall Street executives do in their high-end (pant) suits. But if you’re an adult with a source of income, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t invest. Moreover, if you’re at a stage where you want to find better ways of managing your personal finances, looking into investments is the way to go! So, here we go, let’s learn a little about investing!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-in-handling-your-finances-what-are-the-basic-types-of-investments">Lessons in handling your finances: What are the basic types of investments?</h2>



<p>If you’re new to the world of investing, everything probably feels overwhelming right now. And that’s <em>okay</em>. It will take a while before you can familiarize yourself with the different types of investment options available to you and if they’re a good fit or not. So, rather than throwing a bunch of jargon at you, we thought we’d make things a bit easier for you. Which is to say that today we’ll be looking at three basic types of investments that are best suited for beginners handling their finances. Maybe you’ve heard some of these before, maybe you haven’t. But by the end of this, you’ll definitely get a better understanding of the different options available to you and how each of these will help you in managing your personal finances! So, let’s start with the most basic one.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Financial Planning Basics: The 6 Golden Rules To Save Money</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-easiest-way-to-start-handling-your-finances-retirement-account">The easiest way to start handling your finances: retirement account</h2>



<p>You probably weren’t expecting 401(k) to show up on this list, but here we are. Investing through your employer is a great, low-risk way of handling your finances. For most employees, a retirement account is the first investment they make. Especially, if your employer matches a percentage of your contribution towards your fund. What’s more is that there isn’t generally, a minimum amount you need to contribute towards the fund. Pay whatever amount you&#8217;re comfortable with. Though it is recommended that you contribute at least enough to be able to claim the full employer match. So, if you’ve just started managing your personal finances, definitely look into retirement funds. If you already have one, great! If you don’t, reach out to HR to find out what your options are!</p>



<p><strong>Roomi tip:</strong> If your employer doesn’t offer a retirement plan (or if you’re self-employed), don’t worry! You can open an IRA account on your own. Go <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here </a>to learn more! For those interested in diversifying their retirement savings, considering different asset classes can be beneficial. One such option is <a href="https://www.pimbex.com/article/how-do-i-open-a-gold-and-silver-ira/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding gold and silver to your IRA</a>, which provides a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Learn more about the process and advantages of setting up a gold and silver IRA to secure your financial future.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fixed-income-investments">Fixed-Income Investments</h2>



<p>As the name might suggest, this is one of the safest investments for beginners out there. A fixed-income investment is generally known as a bond. These bonds allow the investor to get a fixed-rate payment over a specific period of time. Bonds are offered by both companies and governments and is one of the largest markets out there. You can actually look at bonds as a loan that you are giving out to the government or a company. And you get a specific amount of interest back, called the coupon rate, in exchange for this loan. This interest is generally paid once or twice a year till the whole amount is paid off i.e. the bond reaches its maturity. </p>



<p>If you’re planning on holding onto the bond till it reaches maturity, you don’t have to worry about your return on investment. You’ll be fine. But if you want to further buy or sell your bond before its maturity, then the market fluctuations will affect you. Just remember this simple rule and you’ll be fine- when interest rates increase, the price of the bond decreases, and as interest rates decrease, the price of the bond increases. If you’re looking for a low-risk way of managing your personal finances, we definitely recommend fixed-income investments! So, if you&#8217;re just starting to think about handling your finances better, this could be your best bet!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-equity-investments-or-stocks">Equity investments or Stocks</h2>



<p>This is probably what you were looking for when you clicked on this blog. Everyone’s mind always goes to stocks when they hear the word “investment”. Which is just as well because equity investment is great for beginners. If you’re not quite sure what they are, don’t worry, you’ve just started managing your personal finances! In a nutshell, equity investments is the buying and selling of stocks of publicly traded companies. Which means, public trade companies sell shares to investors as a way to raise capital to expand their business. In return, the investors get equity interest in the company. Some companies also offer dividends to their investors for every stock they own, which adds extra value to <a href="https://www.gainify.io/top-investors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top investors portfolio</a>, making them happy. If you’d like to research and compare the companies that pay dividends, go to <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dividend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Dividend.com</a>!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Of course, if you want to invest in stocks, you need to have an adequate understanding of the stock market. After all, if the company you’re invested in is doing well, only then can you make a profit from the stocks you own. If you’re thinking of equity investments, we recommend doing some market research beforehand. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo Finance</a> and <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morningstar</a> can be really helpful to better understand how the market is behaving and what companies you should invest in! The more you understand the stock market, the better you’ll get at equity investment. Trust us, before you know it, you’ll be a master of handling your finances!</p>

<p>The world doesn’t run the way it did for the previous generation and today&#8217;s millennials have new challenges to face and paths to carve. Although some things come easy, many of us tend to struggle with financial management.</p>



<p>As a wise person once said &#8211; sometimes it&#8217;s not about the money, but rather the process of managing the money.</p>



<p>While having a steady income helps set a foundation for financial stability, it doesn’t end there. Here are 5 common personal finance mistakes that are made and you should avoid &#8211;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Spending at the same rate as you earn: not setting personal finance goals</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:57%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o6Mbcz94dOkPD2lDW" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Mbcz94dOkPD2lDW/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Once you start earning, it gets tempting to spend on things you’ve always wanted. Living in the moment certainly has an appeal but beware of getting lost in the sauce. It leaves you with nothing for a rainy day or your future. Get a handle on your personal finance goals early on.</p>



<p>Another trap that millennials often fall into is the ‘lifestyle inflation’ snare. Don’t spend all of your bonus on an exotic holiday or upgrade to a bigger apartment just because you got a raise.</p>



<p>With good financial management, you can do all of this just a few years down the line and without having to worry about your bank balance depleting. We’re not saying you should live like a hermit, but who can deny the importance of making a budget in New York?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Wealth is not about having a lot of money, it&#8217;s about having a lot of options.</p><cite>Chris Rock</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Not understanding how your credit score affects your personal finance</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Is your credit score important? Yes! There are so many myths about what influences your credit score.</p>



<p><strong>If you don’t have your info straight, you could unintentionally be <em>harming your own credit score!</em> Here are a few quick points to remember when you put together a budget in New York:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>850 is the best credit score. However, as long as you have a number above 740, you will be eligible for the best lending rates.</li><li>Your payment history, your debt and your balances impact your credit score the most.</li><li>Pay off your debt in time and the full amounts due. Carrying balances when you don’t need to will add interest to your loan <em>and</em> bring your credit score down.</li><li>Try not to use over 30% of the credit available to you at any given time!</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Not signing up for health insurance</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:52%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/mAIPd6GH5qB4nFTfQ5" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/mAIPd6GH5qB4nFTfQ5/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Insurance is an important part of your financial management. In case you didn&#8217;t know, not having health insurance could mean being charged with a penalty when you file your taxes. There is also the danger of an accident or unexpected illness that can blow way past your personal budget in New York.</p>



<p>It’s a big gamble that could put you in debt. In some cases, even graduates can be covered by their parents’ health insurance. If you’re not eligible, look for the best possible plan keeping in mind the essential nature.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Poor financial management and having too many credit cards</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/hZq5XitsxurUBzfWFP" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/hZq5XitsxurUBzfWFP/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Using a credit card instead of a debit card does offer an additional layer of safety from identity theft or fraud. But beware of signing up for more credit cards than you can handle. It’s important to pay them off every month so as to not let debt pile up.</p>



<p>If you entered the workforce recently, focus on building up your bank account rather than spending cash. Once you have a decent balance, it will become easier to pay off your cards. Remember that a credit card is not there to pay for your necessities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5.Putting all your savings in a single fund (and not having a rainy day fund)</h2>

<p>Many millennials make the mistake of saving for just one thing at a time – like for a house or a car. However, if 2020 has taught us anything, is that you need to be prepared for unexpected situations. So, having an emergency fund is key. This should be able to support you through an illness, an accident, or job loss for about 3-6 months.</p>



<p>A rainy-day fund is for a different, smaller purpose. It’s for an emergency plumbing repair or a sudden trip to the mechanic. Setting aside money for emergencies and unexpected expenses means you don’t have to dig into your main savings nest egg. It offers plenty more financial stability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The movie Wolf of Wall Street starring the dynamic Leonardo Dicaprio is a popular cult classic, primarily due to the outrageously true story it tells about the former Wall Street mogul Jordan Belfort. He quickly jumped through the ranks of brokers at Wall Street to attain the golden NYC dream of a large mansion and even larger bank account.</p>



<p>In the famous, catchy lyrics of rapper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy4n88CjiBY&amp;list=PLEUt5XeZei-szK0m5V4zVxjpFVRajewYb&amp;index=6">We</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy4n88CjiBY&amp;list=PLEUt5XeZei-szK0m5V4zVxjpFVRajewYb&amp;index=6" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy4n88CjiBY&amp;list=PLEUt5XeZei-szK0m5V4zVxjpFVRajewYb&amp;index=6"> Walker</a>:</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>These words accurately reflect the glorified lifestyle of the high-riding, bank account-breaking Wall Street broker. He eventually faced downfall when he became complicit in his power as a wealthy businessman, believing he could do no wrong.</p>



<p>Although the Wolf of Wall Street may have acquired his wealth through <em>ahem</em> illicit means— as all legends have their pitfalls— <strong>he left behind some key lessons on financial management that we can all appreciate.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Roomi delves deeper into the lessons from Jordan Belfort that open the door to better personal finance choices, cash flow and financial freedom.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Follow along for tips on how to save money while living in the city and ensure prime financial management, inspired by the Wolf of Wall Street himself.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Have a healthy relationship with your bank account</h2>

</div>
</div>



<p>One of the primary lessons on personal finance we can learn from the film is to have a good relationship with your money. <strong>As the saying goes, the more you take care of your money, the more it will take care of you!</strong> If the numbers in your bank account stress you out and financial management feels like the hill you will die on, remember financial planning help is always around the corner.</p>



<p>Personal finance apps are a great way to keep track of your cash flow. Financial freedom is a slow and steady process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Avoid initial public offerings (IPOs) and shady investment opportunities!</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>Jordan Belfort enjoyed the fruits of his financial scams via fraudulent IPOs (initial public offerings) and “pump and dump” schemes. <strong>It is important to remember that stock brokers or financial representatives do not keep your financial freedom or personal finances in mind when making deals.</strong> The end goal and business model for these companies is to reward the seller, more than you, the buyer. Your financial planning is your own first priority.</p>



<p><strong>If the investment scheme offers returns that seem too good to be true, steer clear!</strong> Greed leads to bad decision-making and never bodes well for financial management. When investing, take calculated risks that won’t hurt your bank account and cash flow in the long run.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Create a core set of values for your personal finance</h2>

</div>
</div>



<p>Financial planning doesn’t have to be hard. Grab a journal, sticky note or write it on your mirror! Create your own personal golden rules for financial management. <strong>This could be as easy as a note on your fridge “Take out only on Fridays!” or a reminder to spend on that Starbucks drink only on the first Monday of the month.</strong> Small reminders in addition to tracking your expenses each week can help you stay on top of your personal finances and focus on keeping a regular cash flow.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Seek out new opportunities and be open to learning</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>This is a great lesson in persistence, and being open to whatever opportunities are out there when financial management is tough and you need the extra cash flow. <strong>Don’t shy away from new jobs, or small part-time gigs that might help your bank account and gain some financial freedom.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Remember it’s okay to make mistakes!</h2>

If you have persistence, you will come out ahead of most people. More importantly, you will learn. When you do something, you might fail. But that’s not because you’re a failure. It’s because you have not learnt enough. Do it differently each time. One day, you will do it right. Failure is your friend.” </p><cite>Jordan Belfort</cite></blockquote>
</div>
</div>



<p>Belfort experienced a major downfall when his illegal investment schemes came to light, and was ordered to repay close to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-wolf/wolf-of-wall-street-says-his-story-offers-lesson-idINTRE7930PM20111004?edition-redirect=in" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">$200 million</a> that he had earned, as reported by Reuters. He gradually helped return all the money through financial advising and business ethics lectures.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>The lesson: don’t give up on your personal finance goals.</strong> With proper financial planning, a little bit of strict financial management, it won’t be long before you stop looking for “tips to save money”. <strong>Learn from your past mistakes- identify transactions on your bank account statements where you spend the most money and rectify as you go.</strong> Don’t be afraid to set goals for yourself, and try again when you fall short. Trying your best till you succeed is the true secret to financial freedom.</p>

<p>The way you handle finances in your youth is likely to remain the same throughout your 20&#8217;s &#8211; unless you do something about it. If you are impulsive around money when you&#8217;re young, you will likely struggle with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial issues</a> in your 30&#8217;s. Financial planning and lessons learned late in life can be costly. If you learn how to protect your savings in your 30&#8217;s (which includes getting a retirement fund FYI), you&#8217;ll make the rest of your life a hundred times easier.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s never too late to consider making sound financial decisions that you may have missed along the way. It&#8217;s essential to learn the basics of finances, whether you earn money or not. Budgeting, financial planning, and savings are useful learnings for all ages.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Financial Planning 101: Start saving</h2>



<p>You can then make your finances work for you. Find out your monthly expenditure and stick to your budget for at least three months. This way, you can build a habit and push yourself to hold on to that attitude for the year. As you consistently depend on your budget to handle your finances, you get to manage money much better. It will then help you gain clarity on your non-essential expenditure.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Start your financial planning early</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re young, it&#8217;s easy to push financial planning and financial goals to the later stages of your life (and to the back of your mind). People think that saving starts once you are secure and have a job or have many responsibilities. Nothing can be far from that as financial planning and goals begin early in your life.</p>



<p>Put that little money you have in your possession to good use. Know what you want to have, and take this time to practice essential money management habits. All habits reared at this stage of life, i.e., savings, budgeting, and living well within your means, go a long way toward shaping your life and attitude.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Beware of debt when financial planning</h2>



<p>You will require debt at some stage in life but try to have &#8216;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/12/good-debt-bad-debt.asp" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">good debt</a>.&#8217; Avoid lifestyle debts to match your friends or colleagues. Go for a small, simple car as your first car rather than a flashy one. Just because your friend wears the latest branded clothes does not mean that you should do the same. Do not let your life get derailed by other people&#8217;s lifestyles. This way, you will have room to pay for a deposit towards your house.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Protect your savings</h2>



<p>Protect your savings and link them to your long-term goals. If you have saved for emergencies, don&#8217;t touch that money unless you are in a crisis. If you&#8217;re serious about financial planning, it&#8217;s really important to have an emergency fund. It&#8217;s best to maintain a six-month emergency fund. with three months&#8217; worth in a liquid fund. It is time to be mature and remain disciplined to your savings goals &#8211; and not deviate from them just because you feel like splashing out on a new flashy watch.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Be aware of your credit</h2>



<p>Be cautious of your credit card spending, and do not cross one-third of your credit limit. Keep no more than three credit cards, and make sure that you pay off the bill at the end of the month. This way, you avoid unnecessary interest on a part paid credit.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Manage your income</h2>



<p>You might have made all the right financial plans and decisions, but you need to review them regularly. A review helps your finances align with external factors like interest rate cuts that might affect your savings. A map of your financial situation is periodically required when you move to a steady income stage and thereby reallocate the spread.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Too early for retirement fund?</h2>



<p>Your financial planning will not be complete without a retirement fund.  It&#8217;s like going to the gym regularly – some can, many can&#8217;t. When you begin to build this habit early in your life, you get stuck to it as a &#8216;normal,&#8217; just like savings. Retirement fund works the best when you are regular with it and under 30. We strongly recommend contributing towards your retirement fund.

<p>It pays to make the right financial decisions in life. Build that savings base, manage your debt, and have controlled spending patterns. A financially literate person will make better business decisions and will use the finances productively to serve their best needs.</p>
