<p>Life with a&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-im-stuck-coliving-with-roommates-i-dont-like-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">roommate</a>&nbsp;isn’t always rainbows and butterflies — even we’ll admit to that. But when you have to share a space with someone, it’s vital to find a way to get along. Even if that means looking past the stack of dirty dishes&nbsp;or overflowing garbage can. But when the little stuff becomes too much to handle for one party, it can create palpable tension that can quickly turn toxic.</p>



<p>Good communication is the key to a healthy roommate relationship, but if you’re getting bad vibes without a clear reason why, you might have a serious issue on your hands.&nbsp;We talked to an expert on common behaviors of a passive-aggressive roommate and how to deal if you’re living with one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-passive-aggression">What is Passive Aggression?</h3>



<p>Psychology professor and clinical psychologist&nbsp;<a href="http://psychology.nova.edu/faculty/profile/dorfman.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dr. William Dorfman</a>&nbsp;defines passive-aggressive behavior as a dishonest expression of anger and hostility — an indirect expression of feelings people don’t want to confront. The most serious implication of this behavior is that doesn’t directly solve problems but rather expresses resentment&nbsp;and disapproval, making it difficult to deal with or improve a situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-signs-of-a-passive-aggressive-roommate">What are the Signs of a Passive-Aggressive Roommate?</h2>



<p>Thirty-year-old blogger, Chloe, who prefers not to use her real name, knows what this feels like. She and a friend lived with a passive-aggressive roommate in a townhouse during her freshman year of college. She says their&nbsp;roommate regularly passive-aggressively found ways to be inconsiderate. Eventually, the situation escalated to the point they felt uncomfortable in their own home.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“He would leave messes, and we would have to clean up after him, but then he would complain about me to the third roommate or about her to me,” says. “It became very uncomfortable because we would end up just trying to avoid him to keep the peace. It was like the tension became our fourth roommate. It was this real thing that was always present. You aren’t home without comfort and feeling protected and safe. When that is stripped from you, you avoid home until it’s late. You have no peace, no comfort.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>While anyone can react to a difficult situation passive-aggressively, Dorfman says some consistent behaviors indicate it’s not&nbsp;someone simply blowing off steam.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“It’s inherently an interpersonal process and a personality trait.&nbsp;Sometimes, we even diagnose it in clinical psychology as a passive-aggressive personality disorder when it really characterizes a person, not just once in a while.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>To add, here are some common passive-aggressive behaviors that your roommate might exhibit along with strategies for dealing with them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-procrastination-on-chores">1. Procrastination on chores</h3>



<p>No matter how many times you ask your roommate to do something, they’ll make excuses until it becomes obvious that they’re not happy. They might&nbsp;say they’re going to do the dishes after you ask, but it never happens. Repetitive procrastination&nbsp;is likely an indication of not wanting to do something.</p>



<p>Dorfman says,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“We all procrastinate, but when you procrastinate with someone else, it affects the other person’s rights and they’re left with the problem.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-being-forgetful-and-late">2. Being forgetful and late</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive roommate consciously or unconsciously forgets what’s asked of them, or is constantly late. Lateness, according to Dorfman, is another way of saying &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take control of the situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>For example, you may ask your roommate to arrive home by a certain time so you can rest, but they’ll be late and say they forgot your request. Or they may forget that you asked them not to eat your food in the fridge. When your roommate makes it a habit&nbsp;to be inconsiderate, it can be a sure sign of passive aggressiveness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-silent-treatment">3. Silent treatment</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive roommate may also shut down when faced with conflict. Instead of talking about the issue, they express neither hostility nor honesty. Rather than negotiating to solve an uncomfortable situation, they give you the silent treatment.</p>



<p>Not talking, Chloe says, was one of the main issues in her roommate relationship. Looking back now, she says she’s more aware of what to look for.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“The person will either say nothing was wrong or lash out. Either way, I would try to bring a peaceful and calm environment to whatever forum you decide to have and just keep having communication lines open.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-actions-don-t-match-the-attitude">4. Actions don&#8217;t match the attitude</h3>



<p>Perhaps the most toxic passive-aggressive behavior is acting one way and feeling another. They come across as being insincere or “fake nice”. For example, your roommate might ask you to “pick up” some toilet paper from the store, but it eventually becomes a routine.&nbsp;Dorfman likens the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/coliving-101-help-my-roommate-talks-behind-my-back-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">situation</a>&nbsp;to someone stabbing you in the back while smiling to your face.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“Often people who are passive-aggressive have an obvious, gratuitous attitude toward you that is not consistent with the way they act,” Dorfman says. “If you’re smiling at someone and being very sweet and friendly, how can you be angry?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-your-roommate-doesn-t-have-a-good-reason-to-be-angry">5. Your roommate doesn’t have a good reason to be angry</h3>



<p>Not every passive-aggressive roommate necessarily procrastinates or is stubborn and manipulative. The root of the behaviors of your roommate could also be that they don’t like being limited by others. Before jumping to conclusions, you should consider this first.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“If you’re not doing anything to instill or create any frustration or resentment, they don’t need to act in a passive-aggressive way,” Dorfman says. “It’s only when they’re called upon to do something or they’re not getting their way. Rather than address that they’re frustrated, they shut down and become stubborn, quiet, and withdrawn.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“They keep on saying, ‘I’m going to do it’ and ‘I’m sorry,’ and yet you continue to feel resentful about them. So, when your feelings don’t match up and you’re left confused about how you should deal with this person, that’s one indication that it’s not necessarily you. You’re getting mixed messages from this person.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-backhanded-compliments">6. Backhanded compliments</h3>



<p>Backhanded compliments are comments or expressions that seem positive at first, but it&#8217;s actually an insult. These are also known as &#8220;non-compliments&#8221; or &#8220;disguised insults&#8221; as backhanded compliments are usually indirect and subtle.</p>



<p>Some examples of backhanded compliments are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When you get a new haircut and your roommate says, &#8220;your haircut makes your nose look smaller.&#8221;</li>



<li>You&#8217;re going out for the night and they say, &#8220;that&#8217;s a beautiful dress on you. I didn&#8217;t even realize it was you at first glance.&#8221;</li>



<li>When your roommate comments on how your room or personal space looks: &#8220;I wish I was as relaxed as you in this mess.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-being-sarcastic">7. Being sarcastic</h3>



<p>Having a sarcastic roommate can be tiresome if it gets too much. It&#8217;s similar to backhanded compliments in a way that both are verbal and indirect, but sarcastic comments are a bit more upfront than backhanded compliments.</p>



<p>Plus, sarcasm is usually with irony or mockery that can be hurtful, especially with roommates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-slamming-doors-intentionally">8. Slamming doors intentionally</h3>



<p>Another sign of having a passive-aggressive roommate is when they slam the doors to your apartment intentionally. For example, you had an argument, you told them off, or confronted them on something they did, then they suddenly leave the apartment then slam the door on their way out. It&#8217;s disrespectful and can disturb others living the apartment or even on the same floor, as the noise of the door slamming travels through the hallway.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-deal-with-a-passive-aggressive-roommate-tips-amp-tricks">How to Deal with a Passive-Aggressive Roommate: Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<p>It’s normal to feel angry when <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-to-set-in-apartments-for-rent-with-roommates/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dealing</a> with the behaviors of a passive-aggressive roommate. But the thing to keep in mind with passive-aggressive roommates is, you can&#8217;t change them.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“[You] can get them to stop eating their food a lot easier than they can get them to become more open with their anger and more responsible with their feelings,” Dorfman says. “You deal with the specific situation, not with the personality.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>As per Dorfman, some solutions to dealing with a passive-aggressive roommate are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tell your roommate you&#8217;re frustrated, ask them what&#8217;s going on, and discuss your concerns with them. But you should also be prepared for them to get defensive and shut down.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Talk to someone you trust who can see the situation objectively to get their perspective.</li>



<li>Try going to therapy or counseling to work things out if both are willing.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, the solutions depend on how volatile the behaviors of your roommate are.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“Passive-aggressive style is on a continuum; it’s not all or nothing. Certain people are more passive-aggressive than others, so I wouldn’t count anyone out who has a particular difficulty with someone,” Dorfman says. “You have to make the effort to try to resolve the issues and call somebody on what’s going on.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-solution-to-dealing-with-passive-aggressive-roommates">The Solution to Dealing with Passive-Aggressive Roommates</h2>



<p>Finding new roommates may be the solution to dealing with a passive-aggressive roommate. By seeking out individuals who are more communicative and considerate, you can create a more positive and harmonious living environment. Don&#8217;t let one negative experience discourage you from finding roommates who will bring joy and positivity to your home.</p>

<p>In 2017, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20Major%20Depressive%20Episode%20Among%20Adults,-Figure%201%20shows&amp;text=An%20estimated%2017.3%20million%20adults,least%20one%20major%20depressive%20episode.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">6.7% of the adult population</a> in the US reported having at least one major depressive episode. In this co-living guide, we answer a common query: my roommate is depressed; how can I help?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is depression?</h2>



<p>Experiencing grief, feeling blue or down are common human emotions. Everyone has felt it at one point or the other. However, depression is a persistent condition, which should be diagnosed by a qualified professional.</p>



<p><a href="https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/depression" class="broken_link">Depression</a> is a treatable medical condition with varying degrees of severity. It can hamper an individual’s day-to-day functioning and cause them distress. If your roommate is depressed, they may feel helpless, have a bleak outlook on the future, and evaluate themselves as worthless. Understandably, this condition affects not only the individual but also the people around them. Hence, it can be challenging to live with a depressed roommate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to provide support if your roommate is depressed?</h2>



<p>The high prevalence of depression among American adults indicates you will live with a depressed roommate at some point or the other. Mental health struggles can take a huge toll on a person, and as a good roommate, you should know how to provide support to a roommate who is depressed. While adjusting to a depressed roommate may require a little more compromise and understanding, there are numerous ways to extend your support.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A safe environment</h3>



<p>Creating a safe, open, and empathetic environment is the first step in helping your depressed roommate. Mental health is a sensitive topic, and your roommate may take some time to open up to you. Don’t be offended if you’re not the first person they turn to, as they may not feel comfortable sharing their struggles with you just yet.</p>



<p>When the time arises, ensure respectful communication. Active listening is important to help create an empathetic and safe environment. Providing them with a safe environment shows that you are willing to be a part of their support system.</p>

<p>Depression needs to be diagnosed by a qualified professional. However, there are certain <a href="https://adaa.org/webinar/consumer/depression-how-recognize-it-and-how-treat-it" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">signs to watch out for</a> if you think your roommate is depressed. Common signs of depression include low energy and motivation (sometimes even getting out of bed may feel like a chore to them) and loss of interest in usual activities. You will notice a marked change in your roommate, where they may stop participating in activities that would bring them joy.</p>



<p>You may also notice that your roommate has anxiety, which commonly occurs with depression. Additionally, you may also notice physical symptoms such as a change in their sleeping pattern, constant complaints of headaches and body aches, along with a change in their appetite. Knowing these common signs of depression is helpful, as it can help you understand your roommate better. Sometimes, it could also help with early intervention where you encourage your roommate to get treatment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Be supportive of their treatment.</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Depression is a treatable disease</a> with the help of therapy, and sometimes, medication. However, the stigma attached to mental health can often prevent people from getting this help. If you notice your roommate is depressed or has anxiety, be sure to show your support.</p>



<p>Try not to be too critical of their behavior, encourage them to <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/apa-blog/2017/04/treating-depression-psychotherapy-or-medication" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">get treatment</a>, and be supportive. However, don’t take it personally if they refuse your help; it may not be easy for them to rely on others for help.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid enabling harmful behavior.</h3>



<p>A drink or two with your roommate every once in a while can be a good bonding opportunity, but look out for warning signs. Sometimes, people may turn to drugs or alcohol to get some relief. However, this can only lead to severe consequences in the long term, worsening the situation.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for ways to connect with your roommate, try board games or brainstorm other activities instead.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Encourage helpful activities</h3>



<p>Often, people with depression have difficulty completing their daily chores, as they do not find a purpose. Instead of getting into arguments, try to propose activities they enjoy. Goal-based activities such as gardening, cooking, or baking could encourage them and help them get out of bed. Be careful not to push them to do too many things simultaneously, as it may be overwhelming for them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A comfortable home</h3>



<p>Living in a messy environment is not fun for anyone; while you should not have to take on the burden of completing their chores, consider helping in smaller ways. If you have some free time, you can complete some smaller tasks or tidy up the house. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/tips-on-how-to-brighten-up-your-apartment-with-plants/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consider adding houseplants</a> to your apartment, as it can help boost their mood (and yours!).</p>

<p>When living with a depressed roommate, you may have to be a little more understanding and make more compromises. Continue to be supportive of their treatment, and encourage them to get the help that they need. Although there is a limit to what help from family and friends can do, having a strong support system is crucial.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a narcissist?</h2>



<p>First off, you must understand <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">narcissistic personality disorder</a>. (NPD) It is a legitimate mental health condition that requires diagnosis by a mental health professional. The term narcissist is widely used interchangeably with NPD and this is a misunderstanding. While there are certain hallmark characteristics of NPD, having them does not necessarily mean you have the condition. A person can exhibit some characteristics of NPD and not actually suffer from it. However, if their narcissism is a strong pattern of behavior, they may be diagnosed with NPD. The first analysis you need to make is if your roommate is suffering from NPD or if they show have narcissistic tendencies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do I identify a narcissist?</h2>

<li>Need constant praise.</li>



<li>They are willing to take advantage of others to get what they want.</li>



<li>They expect to be treated as superior or leader.</li>



<li>Have no remorse for hurting others.</li>



<li>Blame others for their own bad behavior or mistakes.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dealing with your narcissist roomate</h2>



<p>If you feel that your roommate exhibits a lot of these characteristics, then you could be living with a narcissist roommate.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Accept who they are</h3>



<p>When they want to, those with narcissistic personalities are great at charming people. You might find yourself drawn to your narcissist roommate and their show of grandiose. These are also particularly popular in work settings or among their colleagues. When it comes to narcissists, they seem to draw all the attention towards themselves. Do not let all of this carry you away or make you react to them. Understand that these tendencies are just the way they are and, are common for people like them. Do not take their actions or words personally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do not try to change them</h3>



<p>The first step in dealing with your narcissist roommate is simply accepting that you cannot change them. Do not expect them to change, or you will just end up disappointed and frustrated. No matter how rationally you try to explain things, they are unlikely to hear you. Arguing with a narcissist may escalate the situation and trigger their inability to handle criticism. You need to understand that there is nothing that you can do to change a narcissist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do not feed their behavior</h3>



<p>Now that you have understood the tendencies of a narcissist, do not fall prey to them. They can make you feel pressured to push aside your own needs to keep them satisfied. They can be extremely demanding of your attention, praise, and obedience. However, it is essential you show them that they cannot bully you into submission. If you think there will be a break in their attention-seeking behavior, it doesn&#8217;t come. Do not humor a narcissist&#8217;s false reality and delusions. No matter how much you try to adjust your life to suit their needs, it is never enough.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Know yourself!</h3>



<p>Your narcissist roommate does not live in reality. Hence, their views of themselves and other people are wildly delusional. Remember this when a narcissist tries to manipulate, gaslight, or bully you. Don’t let their shame and blame strategy and manipulation undermine your self-esteem. The best defense against the insults and projections of the narcissist is your self-esteem. When you know yourself well, you are able to reject any unfair criticisms leveled against you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Have &#8216;the talk&#8217;</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve gone over the situation and made your assessment, it is time for you to sit them down. Let them know honestly but in a sensitive and friendly way. Put your foot down and don&#8217;t budge if they are being unreasonable. Avoid confronting them in a public space or in front of a large group of people as this can trigger them. They may react aggressively and fight back to save face. Hence, be ready to back off if you feel the situation could escalate. All the best!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let them go</h3>



<p>Maybe you have tried your best to accept who they are and deal with them. However, they still make living absolutely unbearable. This doesn&#8217;t need to be the case. It may be time to cut off your narcissist roommate. There are many fish (potential roommates) in the sea (city.) If they don&#8217;t value you, it could be time to search for a new roommate. Lucky for you, you&#8217;re already in the right place!</p>



<p>Roomi can help you find roommates and find one who is the right living partner for you. Better luck this time. Choose well!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Assessing the situation</h2>



<p>Before we get around to creating a plan of action, we need to assess the situation. Get to know the problem better and find out what the cause is. Sometimes there is so much more to a situation and person than you think. Here are some questions to ask yourself before you start looking for solutions.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your roommate doing alright?</h3>



<p>This past year or so has been extremely stressful and everyone&#8217;s mental health has taken a toll. It can be understandable if your roommate has been extremely cranky. Is your roommate doing okay? They may under immense pressure from their job or college or be overloaded with assignments. Your roommate maybe just going through a rough patch and keeping it all to themselves.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your roommate mentally unwell?</h3>



<p>Coming off the previous point, your roommate may be suffering from mental issues. You may not understand or know what is going in their personal lives. Thus, you only see them being difficult with you. While you are probably not a mental health expert, there may be signs. Are they having difficulties with people, their work, or their family? Do they seem to be troubled all the time and can&#8217;t seem to have fun once in a while?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is it your fault?</h3>

<p>No, we aren&#8217;t gaslighting you or putting the blame on you, friend. We&#8217;d never. Your controlling roommate should never behave with you like that anyway. However, a little self-reflection may be in order. Is there something that you have done to see this side of them? Is there a time that you may have been rude or unkind to justify this kind of treatment? Or are you skipping your chores or being exceptionally messy?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are they just jealous?</h3>



<p>Now, we understand that you&#8217;re quite a cool kid and your friends love you. While you may have previously expected that your roommate will too, it is possible they&#8217;re jealous. After all, not everyone can handle all the awesomeness hon.</p>



<p>There could be some reason why your controlling roommate is jealous of you. This may just be their way of expressing it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding a solution</h2>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve found the root of the problem, it&#8217;s time to resolve this, once and for all. You want to be careful and sensitive while dealing with your roommate. Make sure you don&#8217;t send them into a flying rage. However, if you read on, we&#8217;re pretty sure you won&#8217;t.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-do-i-resolve-a-conflict-with-my-college-roommate/">Related: </a><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-do-i-resolve-a-conflict-with-my-college-roommate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Do I Resolve A Conflict with my College Roommate?</a></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You have to deal with it</h3>



<p>Now, not all of us are great at confrontation. The introverts and socially awkward kids among us understand the pressure of something like this. However, you can&#8217;t always keep walking on eggshells around your own apartment. Think of all that you have been put with, and convince yourself that you need to have this conversation. The sooner you deal with this the better. Do not put it off for later and give a chance for more issues to come up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make changes yourself</h3>



<p>If there is any way that you may have triggered your controlling roommate, try to see if you can do something. Clean up your space, be considerate, do your chores and give them their space. If there is something that you are doing wrong, try to make amends and see if your controlling roommate reacts to this positively.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lend an ear to them</h3>



<p>It could be that issues at work, college, or their personal life are the cause of their behavior. Make yourself more approachable and let them know you are there to lend an ear to them. If not, approach them and ask them how they are doing. Perhaps even share a few problems that you are having and take initiative. If they warm up to you and share their problems, then you may be on the path to a resolution.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Be sensitive and mindful</h3>



<p>When you sit down to have a conversation with your controlling roommate, be mindful of how you approach them. The last thing you want to do is come off as aggressive or antagonize your controlling roommate. Make sure you approach them in a friendly way. If you have common friends, you may want to discuss this with them and even have them there. Be sensitive and willing to hear if they have any issues.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exercise caution</h3>



<p>The last thing you want to do is trigger your controlling roommate. They could have a tendency to go off the hook. If you feel that things could head wildly South, then make sure you have a friend around. If things escalate, be ready to call building security, the management, or even the police. After all, you never know with people. The last thing you want is to get hurt or into a physical conflict.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Set rules</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s never too late to set rules. If you feel that setting rules and boundaries will help, sit your roommate down. You can make a set of rules and responsibilities to share. This may help with your situation and ease the tension. Be open to their suggestions as well, and try to make something that works for everyone. Remember your rights as a roommate too. You don&#8217;t need to cave into ridiculous suggestions from your controlling roommates.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Time for &#8216;the talk&#8217;</h3>



<p>No, not that one. Once you&#8217;ve gone over the situation and made your assessment, it is time for you to sit them down. Let them know honestly but in a sensitive and friendly way. Put your foot down and don&#8217;t budge if they are being unreasonable. However, be ready to back off if you feel the situation could escalate. This is the make or break part. All the best!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If all fails</h2>



<p>Maybe it just isn&#8217;t meant to be with your controlling roommate. Never mind. There are many fish (potential roommates) in the sea (city.) If they don&#8217;t value you, it could be time to search for a new roommate. Lucky for you, you&#8217;re already in the right place!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>College life is one of the most transformative periods in a person’s life. I mean, how could it not be? You’re meeting new people, in a new city (maybe even <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/find-room-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a>?!) <em>and</em> you’re away from the comfort of your home! It’s kind of like an adulthood version of throwing yourself into the deep-end of the pool, and waiting to see if you sink or swim. Of course, it’s not all scary. You’ll make lifelong friends, have profound experiences and a whole lot of memories! And one of these profound experiences is the one that involves you living with a stranger. Y’know, your roommate? Your college roommate, conflict and all, will always hold a special meaning for you. And as fun as it is to have someone to share this whole new experience with, roommate problems are bound to arise.</p>



<p>So, today, we thought we’d talk about how to deal with conflicts that arise when you’re living with a college roommate for the very first time. Don’t worry, most problems are fixable if you both have the right tools. And that’s what we’re here to help with!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resolve any conflict with your college roommate with an agreement</h2>



<p>We know agreement sounds like such a formal word. I mean, that’s something you sign when you’re an <em>adult </em>adult and want to buy a New York City penthouse or something. But you’d be surprised by how much this helps. Of course, this document is not legally binding, but that doesn’t mean it’s not effective! Writing down your wants, needs and expectations from your roommate (and vice versa) can really set the right tone for your relationship. Trust us, you’ll feel like you know your new roommate a lot better after reading this agreement. And when conflict inevitably arises with your college roommate, you can just refer back to this agreement. <em>This </em>is how you deal with roommate problems in a healthy way!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communication is key when dealing with college roommate conflict</h2>



<p>We know, confronting a new college roommate might seem like a bad idea. After all, you want to be friends with your roommate, not accuse them of causing problems. But that’s just it, honest communication isn’t confrontation (Of course, if you decide to scream all your problems in their face, it won’t help). But if you (kindly and gently) let your roommate know when they do something you don’t like, they’ll try to accommodate you. They probably didn’t mean to piss you off on purpose.</p>



<p>Not to sound too much like a marriage counselor, but communication really is the key to most of your problems. A conflict with your college roommate will only escalate if you don’t communicate with them. What is a mild annoyance today, <em>will</em> become <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-stress-of-poor-communication-with-others-4154175" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">unbearable</a> when you’re both stressed out about final exams later in the semester. So, nip it in the bud and your dorm room will be a safe haven for both of you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t point fingers at them</h2>



<p>We’re just going to keep the marriage counselor vibe going for just a second longer and give you this one advice: don’t put all the blame on them. When you start pointing fingers at them and blame them for all your problems, they will get <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/love-relationships/words-matter-you-vs-i/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defensive</a>. This is actually advice that doesn’t just help you deal with your roommate problems, but problems with every other person. The moment people get defensive, they start (verbally) attacking back and that just doesn’t lead to anything good. And if your opponent is an 18 year old New York City college student, <em>oh boy</em>. So, maybe you should try telling them how their actions made you feel instead of telling them they’re irritating and a bad roommate. Sensitivity is key when dealing with a conflict with your college roommate!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If nothing else works, it’s time to call in the RA</h2>



<p>Your <a href="https://www.sofi.com/blog/pros-cons-of-being-an-ra/#:~:text=A resident assistant or resident,the residents of a dorm.&amp;text=Sharing information about the residence,campus activities%2C and available resources." target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Advisor</a> (or RA) might seem annoying when they’re enforcing “quiet hours” and telling you all the different ways in which you’re breaking University rules. But when it comes to mediating a conflict with your college roommate, they’re godsent. If your roommate problems persist and nothing seems to solve it, it may be time to call in your RA. Shoot them an email, or text (or snapchat, if y’all are cool) and let them know of the situation.</p>



<p>From there you can decide what action to take. Maybe the RA can meet with both of you one-on-one or perhaps a group session might be helpful. Whatever it is, an outside mediation can really put things into perspective.&nbsp; In the rare cases where nothing seems to work and you just can’t live with your roommate anymore, they might even help you switch rooms. Though this is a lot harder to do once the semester is already half-way done.</p>

<p>College life will throw you in a lot of situations that are less than ideal. That includes unpleasant roommates, but don’t let that ruin the whole experience for you. Honestly it actually might be good practice for if you ever move to New York City. Just remember, your roommate is only part of the college experience. And if you just can’t get along with them, there’s always a next semester!</p>

<p>A scornful look, the silent treatment, and passive-aggressive responses? Yep! Your roommate is definitely pissed and is probably drifting from you emotionally. Perhaps you were once best of friends &#8211; two peas in a pod. But something has changed, and now your roommate is refusing to even talk to you. If you&#8217;re wondering what changed, here&#8217;s a list of things that could be causing those problems with your roommates.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6 Common Problems With Roommates &amp; Their Solution</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Your behavior is inappropriate</h3>



<p>Maybe the reason your roommate isn&#8217;t talking to you is because of the inappropriate comments you pass casually, without even realizing you&#8217;re doing it. Perhaps you made some racist remarks, or made comments about their sexuality, or made fun of them/the things they do. Even if you meant no harm, chances are that your roommate is hurt or upset with your behavior. Ask them what&#8217;s bothering them and why are they being cold towards you. If you ask sincerely, your roommate will open up. Respect their feelings and make amends.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. One of the most common roommate problems &#8211; You owe them MONEY!</h3>



<p>Did your roommate lend you money that you haven&#8217;t returned yet? Are they paying for your share of groceries/food or bills? Think hard! If there have been such instances, then your roommate&#8217;s behavior towards you is justified. Most roommate troubles are centered on the unequal distribution of chores and money. Clear debts with your roommate, and always keep a tab, especially when your roommate is covering for you. Nobody likes a person who forgets to pay up.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Your roommate is introverted</h3>



<p>Your roommate could be a shy and quiet person who likes to read more and talk less. It&#8217;s in their nature, buddy &#8211; you can&#8217;t hold it against them. Give them time and space to open up to you, and by no means try to force a conversation on them. It will only make things worse.</p>

	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Another one of the most common roommate problems: You owe them an apology!</h3>



<p>You had a crazy fight with your roommate last week, and ever since, they&#8217;ve been giving you the silent treatment. If your half-hearted apology hasn&#8217;t sorted this situation, maybe it&#8217;s time to sit like adults and talk about what&#8217;s bothering each of you. If they&#8217;re acting like a big old baby, take the initiative to start this discussion. Nobody likes a cold environment at home * shudders *.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Your roommate is going through something personal</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re an overthinker, you probably might be beating yourself up thinking &#8211;&nbsp;<em>Why is my roommate not talking to me? What did I do now?</em>&nbsp;It could be that you&#8217;ve done nothing wrong, and the issue lies somewhere else entirely! Perhaps they&#8217;re having a bad day, difficulties at work, are going through family or relationship strains. While you guys are thick and always discuss your problems, this time, they&#8217;re not ready to talk about it <em>(at least not right now)</em>. Give them their space and tell them that you&#8217;re there for them whenever they&#8217;re ready.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Maybe the real roommate problem is that they don&#8217;t like you</h3>



<p>This might sting <em>(a lot!)</em>, but hey, their behavior doesn&#8217;t define you. Your roommate may have suddenly decided that you two have nothing in common and perhaps shouldn&#8217;t talk. There could be plenty of reasons for this and, if this behavior seems unresolved after many conversations,&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">it&#8217;s time to find your soul roommate!</a>&nbsp;You&#8217;re an awesome individual, and no one can take that away from you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roomi advise for problems with roommates</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s natural to fight with roommates or to be in disagreement with them. However, to keep your house warm, lively, and away from negativity &#8211; promote the culture of open dialog. Set this culture from the beginning and always follow good roommate etiquette to coexist peacefully with everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sometimes your roommate-and as a result, your roommate problems- comes as a package deal. Maybe they have an untrained pet. Or maybe they have a partner who refuses to leave your apartment! So, you can look past the hand-holding on the sofa, the odd lover’s tiff and even the sickly baby names. But, what do you do if you really, really don’t like your roommate’s partner?! How do you deal with your roommates (and their partners) then?!</p>



<p>Your living situation can become even more uncomfortable if <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deal-roommates-significant-never-leaves/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">your roommate’s partner never leaves</a>, and when you’re feeling like an unwanted third wheel in your own apartment, it’s time to address the romantic issue in front of you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I don&#8217;t like my roommate&#8217;s partner cuz they&#8217;re annoying </h2>



<p>Do you feel irritated because you’re forking out for NYC-tier rent every month and they pay nothing to share your tiny space? Is it because they’re taking long showers every morning and making you late for your (already painful) commute? Or is it something more specific that you don&#8217;t like about your roommate&#8217;s partner?</p>



<p>The more generalized issues &#8211; like they’re around all the time, taking your share of the hot water &#8211; can usually be solved with a chat with your roommate. These are pretty common roommate problems that shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to fix. Approach the issue when the S.O isn’t in the house and try to gently set some boundaries. Talk about how many nights per week you’re comfortable with them being around, and discuss a morning schedule so you can use the bathroom when you need it. Initiating talking to your roommate can be hard. Just tell them that you’re on a tight budget and can’t afford to pay the extra electricity bill each month. and that your boss gets annoyed when you’re late for work, you should be able to come to an agreement. You should deal with your roommate&#8217;s partner the way you deal with your roommates who are inconsiderate!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I don&#8217;t like my roommate&#8217;s partner because they make me uneasy</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6ml4x1/i_hate_my_roommates_boyfriend/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">isabellekinza told Reddit</a> about the problems she was having with her roommate’s partner:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“My roommate went home for a couple of weeks for the summer. But he didn&#8217;t leave. In fact, he basically moved in. And this guy makes me uncomfortable. He doesn&#8217;t make passes at me or anything, in fact apart from casual greetings we don&#8217;t talk, but his presence makes me uncomfortable.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I&#8217;m generally a loud and blunt person, but put me in a room with him and I clam up. Which is how I allowed him to berate me for leaving dishes in the sink (for less than a day). Then he told me I wasn&#8217;t cleaning up after myself enough. Which was ironic since the mess he was complaining about was his. I argued weakly but my spine crumbles around him so I angrily cleaned the mess.</em></p><p><em>Then here comes the kicker. Right before my roommate got back the internet stopped working. I couldn&#8217;t log in, and my first thought was that he&#8217;d tampered with it since the internet is in his name and me and my roommate pay him in cash for it. I put that thought down to petty vindictiveness on my part.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>So, this morning, I messaged him. It takes me five minutes to word it nicely in a non accusatory way, and I send it. An hour later he replies saying that he changed the password because I didn&#8217;t pay him.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>It can be tempting to treat your roommate’s partner with hostility or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/2017/05/24/5-common-behaviors-passive-aggressive-roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">passive-aggressiveness</a> in times like this, but that usually just worsens the situation. Dealing with this kind of roommate problems can be a little more tricky.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you deal with your roommates now?</h3>



<p>Again, you could talk to your roommate about how you’re feeling. They may be blissfully unaware of the issue in their home, their judgement clouded by a rosy veil of love! In all likelihood, your roommate&#8217;s partner isn&#8217;t intentionally trying to make you uncomfortable. So, just talk to them!</p>



<p>If that doesn’t work, it’s time to contact your landlord. There could be terms in your contract that specify the number of guests you can have over at a time. And your roommate&#8217;s partner overstaying their welcome could technically present a hazard. </p>

<p>The city administrative code says that every individual living in a residential building should have “a livable area of not less than 80 square feet”. There is no state/city law in place that requires renters to tell their landlords about visitors. But it&#8217;s still worth checking your lease agreement. Some individual landlords add guest-related clauses that could work in your favor. While ideally you should deal with your roommate&#8217;s partner by communicating with them directly. But sometimes it&#8217;s just not possible to deal with your roommate problems this way. Speaking with your landlord is the only way to deal with your roommates. </p>



<p>Make your landlord aware of the issue to discuss your options. If they can’t do anything about your roommate’s partner, then it might be time to look for a new place. There are thousands of great potential roommates out there. The most important thing is that you feel safe and happy in your own home! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So, your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets. You love animals, but you don’t love annoying roommates. Whether your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-late-paying-rent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate is always late paying rent</a> or they don’t take proper care of their cat, dog, budgie or iguana, it’s you who feels the impact. So, if you find yourself regularly cleaning up poop, vacuuming hairs or sharing your chicken legs with hungry pets, how can you stay sane?</p>



<p>An <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deal-roommates-untrained-pet/">untrained pet </a>leads to a messy, smelly house, and if you’ve agreed to let your roommate keep their furry friend in your home, there are certain standards they should adhere to. Remember; their pet isn’t your responsibility. So, follow these tips to make the best of the hairy situation that’s unfolding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-roommate-doesn-t-walk-their-dog-often-enough">Your roommate doesn’t walk their dog often enough</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“[My roommate] has a Maltipoo mix who&#8217;s currently 2 years old. They just moved into the place we&#8217;re currently living at about 5 months ago, and I, nearly 2 months ago. I&#8217;m not sure how she&#8217;s taken care of her dog prior to me moving in, but since I&#8217;ve started residing there, I&#8217;ve never seen her walk her dog. I voiced my opinion on this and suggested that she spend more time with him (even take him to work, as her workplace is dog-friendly). She obliged a couple times (maybe 3 times max since I&#8217;ve lived with her) and has spent maybe half a day to a full day once or twice (again, since I&#8217;ve moved in).</em></p>



<p><em>As far as I&#8217;ve seen, Sarah doesn&#8217;t play with the dog at all but she keeps him in her room with her boyfriend as soon as she comes home until the next morning when she&#8217;s off to work/wherever else.”</em></p>

<p>Your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets, and as annoying as it is for you, it&#8217;s worse for the pets. If, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/597xk5/roommate_neglects_her_dog_what_should_i_do/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit poster butwhythough1</a>, you’re feeling sorry for your roommate’s house-bound doggo, what can you do? You know owning a pet is a decision that’s not to be taken lightly. That dog needs exercise, but you no longer want to resort to walking it yourself. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-do-you-do-when-your-roommate-doesn-t-take-care-of-their-pets">So, what do you do when your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets? </h3>



<p>This sort of case isn’t illegal. Just saying your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets won&#8217;t get you very far. So unless the neglect develops into something more extreme, the NYPD or an animal control agency won’t be able to help. Instead, you’ll have to voice your concerns to your roommate. So, make him/her aware that dogs need to be walked. Provide numbers for local dog walkers if they don’t have the time. Sometimes your annoying roommates only need a guiding hand to see the errors of their ways.</p>



<p>If that’s not an option, a careful conversation should help you determine what is. If they’re struggling to find either the time or money to take care of your pet, it might be time to let go. Speak to them about finding another loving home that can give the animal the life it deserves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-roommate-s-pet-isn-t-potty-trained">Your roommate’s pet isn’t potty-trained</h2>



<p>A cat that can’t use the kitty litter. A dog that doesn’t do its business outside. Doesn&#8217;t that sound like a nightmare to live with? An untrained pet starts to really affect your own quality of life. It’s difficult to turn a blind eye when unpleasant animal scents waft their way into your nose every time you&#8217;re home. But just because your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets, doesn&#8217;t mean you need to live in a stinky apartment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9m917p/my_roommates_dogs_are_driving_me_crazy_i_dont/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit poster readoldbooks</a> had a similar experience:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“My roommate has a 1.5 year old Aussie Shepherd who constantly pees inside the house, EVERYDAY. She is taken outside every morning, around lunch, every evening, but still pees inside as soon as no one is watching her (even if I am home but in another room, she will pee on the house). She does nothing to alert that she needs to go outside. How can we train her?”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your response to this really depends on your own history with animals. If you’re experienced with cats or dogs, you can guide them! You could actively help them train their pet or offer advice. If not, you’ll find training guides and videos online to share with your annoying roommates. Avoid giving in and cleaning up the mess yourself. This will just let your roomi think they’re off-the-hook and they could stop taking responsibility altogether. Bring the pee or poop to their attention immediately. And make sure the pet owner is keeping on top of any potential hygiene issues.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-the-neglect-is-more-serious">What if the neglect is more serious?</h2>



<p>The fact that your roommate doesn&#8217;t take care of their pets could be a sign of something much worse. So, if you’re witnessing serious animal abuse, you need to do something about it. If talking things through doesn’t yield the outcome you want, remember that as a cohabitant, you can report neglect. Keep a written diary of everything you experience &#8211; with dates, times and specific details wherever possible. Take photos that show the abuse. For example, take pictures of the pet and where its kept. Then <a href="https://www.aspca.org/take-action/report-animal-cruelty" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">report animal cruelty</a> to the appropriate organization. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We can’t choose our family, but we <em>can </em>choose our roommate. That said, a roommate interview is similar to a first date or a job interview &#8211; we put on our brightest smile and try to give the best possible impression of ourselves. Often, it’s not until the lease has been signed and everyone has settled into their new home that the roommate problems begin to show. Maybe you find yourself stuck with a messy roommate, or maybe you&#8217;re dealing with a roommate who&#8217;s just stone-cold. </p>

<p>Before we get into anything else, here&#8217;s a little something that&#8217;ll tell you what the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-find-a-roommate-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">best way to find a roommate</a> is. But if you’ve already moved in with someone and you just hate being around them, what can you do?</p>



<p>Short of hiding out in your bedroom or moving back in with your parents, let’s check out your options based on some common situations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">They’re a messy roommate</h2>



<p>This is one of the most common roommate problems out there. Does it sound familiar to you?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“So my college dorm roommate is still as messy as ever, which I believe I have been fairly tolerant of. However, her stuff continues to flood into my space, even after I&#8217;ve brought it up to her. I like to think I&#8217;m a direct person, and not a pushover, but I don&#8217;t want to seem pushy and keep asking her to make sure she keeps her stuff in HER space. The worst part is that this wouldn&#8217;t even be a problem if she would just use all of her drawer, cabinet, desk, and closet space. It&#8217;s really driving me mad how inconsiderate she keeps acting.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/a4fuv0/messy_roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit poster ohgirlfitup</a>, you’re struggling to co-exist with a messy roommate and have already brought up the problem, what steps can you take? It’s easy to fall into a deep pit of resentment towards an inconsiderate roommate. But, bottling things up often just leads to an outburst from you (and then things get<em> really </em>messy.) </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>But when talking things through doesn’t lead to the nice, neat outcome you’re hoping for, what do you do?</p>



<p><strong>Here&#8217;s some things you can try-</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Pick your battles.</strong></h3>



<p>We get it; your messy roommate has habits that make your skin itch. But complaining about everything won’t help. When dealing with a roommate, only confront them on bigger issues that truly obstruct your daily life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Assign your own spaces.</strong></h3>



<p>Determine which spaces “belong” to each of you and which are communal. If their stuff crosses into your boundary, you can simply put it back into theirs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Create a cleaning roster.</strong></h3>



<p>Write up a schedule of daily and weekly chores, so you’re splitting the cleaning tasks evenly and you’re not left feeling annoyed because you’re <em>always </em>the one to scrub the bathroom.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Their social life doesn’t match up to yours</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/7bosv7/i_hate_my_roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit user handakun</a>, was sharing a bedroom with someone that rarely left the room and didn’t seem to want to get to know her:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“Let&#8217;s call my roommate Tiffany (not her real name). She and I are both first years and we&#8217;re sharing a dorm room. When I first met her, she seemed really kind and genuine so I didn&#8217;t think much about it. However over time, I realized she doesn&#8217;t go out that much. She&#8217;s almost always in the room either watching videos, talking to her friends or family over the phone, etc. She doesn&#8217;t make any effort to get to know me or any of our hallmates.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If you’re in a similar situation, it’s time to mentally remove yourself and take an objective point-of-view. This is actually one of the better roommate problems to have. Okay; so your messy roommate parties less (or more) than you do. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re wrong for doing so. Everyone is different, and you may just need to set some boundaries between the two of you, or learn to accept that everyone lives their own life. At least, they&#8217;re not a messy roommate! </p>

<p>As long as their lifestyle doesn’t affect your quality of living (e.g. they’re waking you up at crazy times), you can learn to live in harmony. Try taking part in activities together, such as cooking a meal, watching a TV series or inviting them out with your friends.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">They’re generally difficult to live with</h2>



<p>Sometimes, your roommate doesn’t have just one annoying habit &#8211; they have lots! On top of being a messy roommate, they sleep with the light on in your shared room. They blast music you hate. Cook smelly food and then leave a mess. And loudly blending their green smoothie at 6 a.m. there&#8217;s just no end to your roommate problems!</p>



<p>We’ve all been there. Dealing with a messy roommate who pisses you off on every level is really hard. But here&#8217;s how can deal with them better- </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Talk things out within 24 hours of a negative event to set rules and boundaries early on.</li><li>Don’t address problems when you’re already annoyed &#8211; stay cool, calm and collected.</li><li>Start the difficult conversation by apologising for not letting them know [insert roomi issue] annoys you at the beginning.</li><li>Suggest possible solutions or ways to land on some middle ground</li><li>Discuss issues in person, rather than via text messages.</li><li>Start by making a joke about the issue, to see if that fixes things up. Address it delicately and avoid veering towards sarcasm. If that doesn’t work, address it more directly. </li></ul>

<p>You’ve found the perfect pad, at the perfect price, in the city you’ve been dying to live in. Roomi may have helped you score some amazing NYC roommates but conflict has arisen, and even if you’re not a fan of adulting, you’re going to need to know how to resolve a roommate <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/">fight</a>&#8211; without the sticky notes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Boundaries and house rules</strong></h2>



<p>Setting boundaries and creating <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-things-include-roommate-agreement/">house rules</a> can be uncomfortable for someone you’re just meeting, even life long friends struggle with this when choosing to cohabitate. But, it’s a necessary awkward that pays off. It’s important to create your rules and to be aware of others. When you hear knocking on your room door because your bass dropped one too many times-don’t be surprised since “Noise Level” is number 7 of the house rules. Honor NYC roommate rules and hold each other accountable. Keep house rules in a public area so all roommates have access and as a reminder. <a href="http://emilypost.com/advice/roommates-establishing-house-rules/">Here you can find tip</a>s on where to begin when creating house rules and boundaries with NYC roommates.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You had a fight with your roommate about Timing</strong></h2>



<p>​You woke up late and your can of Axe was empty- not only did your boss yell at you but you smell. It’s been an all round bad day. Coming home and seeing the same red pot in the sink for the 3rd day in a row has broken the camel’s back and suddenly it’s HulkMania in Apt 102. Before your living room reaches WWE status, consider whether the timing of the confrontation is appropriate and you are not fueled by misdirected stress. The sooner you address the issue, the better it is. In the event that you do blow-off steam whilst confronting a roommate issue, quickly and sincerely apologize for it. Anger charged discussions accomplish nothing and you’ll end up washing the dishes out of guilt anyway.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Face to face communication</strong></h2>



<p>Roommate Facebook pages, group chat/text, and dry erase boards are all modern day platforms for asking NYC roommates to supply their share of toilet paper. When it comes to resolving a fight, discussing broken rules, or confrontation it should be done face to face with all roommates present. Often times what is said in text can be misconstrued. “No, I’m not yelling at you, I’m just really excited about toilet paper”. Avoid THAT <a href="https://climb.pcc.edu/blog/the-7-benefits-of-effective-communication-in-personal-and-professional-settings">conversation</a> by talking to each other more often. The environment of the discussion should feel safe and no single roommate attacked by the rest. So, to effectively resolve a NYC roommate fight, lose the emoji’s and call for a house meeting.</p>
