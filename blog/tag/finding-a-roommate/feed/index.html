<p>In today&#8217;s technological age, looking for a potential roommate means logging into a couple of apps to up your chances of finding your soul roommate. But before that, you need to know how to get around to meeting new people (and eventually your potential roommate!) and getting to know them before you tell them to make themselves at home.</p>



<p>You wonder if it’s going to get awkward. Should you serve wine and cheese or is it too early for that? You wonder whether a couple of beers would break the ice right? The trick here is to have a list of set questions to ask potential roommates.</p>



<p>Whatever you’re thinking, we know when people are looking for roommates, they need to have a strong background check in place to make sure they let the right people in their home. So here’s a bunch of potential roommate questions you should ask before saying yes.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdwellsy.com%2Fblog%2F7-things-to-keep-in-mind-when-youre-trying-to-find-a-roommate&amp;psig=AOvVaw0RxvhYzoXBOy0PeE5tOLaU&amp;ust=1712528111081000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;opi=89978449&amp;ved=0CBIQjRxqFwoTCJD-ysXOroUDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">iStock</a></p>



<p>Most importantly, just be yourself and ask all questions important to your own well being. But also remember to be prepared to answer the questions you ask, for it to feel like a healthy conversation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lifestyle</h2>



<p>Asking about your roommate&#8217;s lifestyle begs the question: How could it possibly affect you whether they like to stay home or go out on the weekends, right? (Unless you’re an&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">antisocial mouse</a>&nbsp;of course.)</p>



<p>But well, these potential roommate questions are important to get to know them better and to get a feel of what it&#8217;s like if you decide to live with them. If they have a large circle of friends that they host every weekend, your personal space could be affected, if that’s not something you like doing on the weekends.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if they happen to mention the exact same things you like to do, then you’d know you’ve found the one, potentially!</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>What do your weekends look like? How about during the weekdays?</li>



<li>What do you do for work? Do you work from home?</li>



<li>Do you have a regular exercise routine? Or practice any sports?</li>



<li>What&#8217;s your worst habit?</li>



<li>Do you smoke or do drugs? How often?</li>



<li>Do you have any allergies or dietary restrictions?</li>



<li>Do you have any pets? Plans to get any pets?</li>



<li>How often do you travel?</li>



<li>Do you prefer a quiet and calm living environment or are you comfortable with occasional gatherings or parties?</li>



<li>How often do you cook at home?</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sleeping schedule &amp; cleaning habits</h2>



<p>Understanding the habits and preferences of your potential roommate when it comes to their sleeping schedule and their approach to tidiness can be pivotal in ensuring a harmonious and comfortable co-living situation. It&#8217;s often beneficial to navigate these discussions with a sense of openness, starting from a place of personal sharing. For instance, you might consider initiating the conversation by candidly discussing your own <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/dealing-with-a-roommates-obsessive-need-to-clean-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">cleaning behavior</a>, which could naturally lead to a dialogue about what cleanliness means in your daily life.</p>



<p>By doing so, not only do you set a tone of transparency and vulnerability, but you also provide a safe space for your prospective roommate to share their cleaning standards and expectations.</p>



<p>Discussing something as personal as cleaning habits can be delicate; however, framing it within the context of your own experiences and values tends to make the conversation feel less like an interrogation and more like a collaborative effort to ensure both you and your roommate can enjoy a clean, organized home that meets both of your needs.</p>



<p>Just keep in mind that not everyone will be a neat freak, and not everyone is a slob either. What you should be looking for is the sweet spot in the middle.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>What conditions do you require to sleep?</li>



<li>What time do you generally wake up and go to bed?</li>



<li>How do you think we should handle household chores? Like cleaning the common areas?</li>



<li>How would you describe your feelings towards cleaning? Are you messy or neat?</li>



<li>What household chore do you like the least?</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Privacy &amp; boundaries</h2>



<p>Establishing boundaries is important in any kind of relationship. Most especially with potential roommates, you should have an open discussion on what privacy and sharing means to the both of you.</p>

<p>Take a look at these privacy questions to ask potential roommates that will eventually lead to a peaceful household in the future (hopefully!).</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you have any references?</li>



<li>How do you feel about sharing stuff (aside from expenses), like kitchen and cleaning equipment?</li>



<li>What are your deal breakers? Do you have any pet peeves?</li>



<li>What do you feel about visitors or guests in the apartment? Do you like having friends over?</li>



<li>What are your feelings about overnight guests?</li>



<li>Are you in a romantic relationship?</li>



<li>Do you prefer to have separate storage spaces for our own food or do you want to share a common pantry?</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Financial responsibilities</h2>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-sitting-behind-the-desk-and-looking-at-receipts-5900074/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Pexels</a></p>



<p>A bolder way to put any financial question to ask your potential roommates would be, can I be assured&nbsp;<a href="https://www.splitwise.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the rent</a>&nbsp;will come on time? This one’s a major ask, so make sure you put it the best way possible. It&#8217;s also important to address any questions about splitting and sharing to avoid any conflict that can happen in the future.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>How much is your rent now?</li>



<li>What do you think is the best way to handle paying rent and utilities?</li>



<li>In situations where a roommate might be facing financial difficulties, how would you handle it?</li>



<li>Are you interested in sharing groceries and cooking meals together occasionally?</li>



<li>Have you ever paid rent late before? If yes, why and how did you make up for it?</li>



<li>Can you put down a deposit?</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Room and roommate expectations</h2>



<p>Yes, people looking for roommates, it’s time to ask about the ‘ex.’ Just like a potential or current significant other refusing to talk about their past is a major red flag, it&#8217;s the same with a potential roommate. Because if they’re cordial and easy to live with, they’ll have a couple of good stories, and some funny ones, and maybe even some&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/help-my-roommate-is-driving-me-up-the-wall-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">challenging ones</a>&nbsp;to share.</p>



<p>But if all they talk about are bad experiences, or if they shy away from the question, it could be a potential red flag that you should definitely watch out for. Try and be as diplomatic as you can when you go for these types of questions to ask potential roommates.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Have you had a roommate before?</li>



<li>How was your experience living with others? What did you like and dislike about it?</li>



<li>Are you still friends or in contact with your former roommates?</li>



<li>What are you looking for in a potential roommate?</li>



<li>Is it important to know your neighbors?</li>



<li>Who gets the biggest room when moving in?</li>



<li>How long do you plan to stay?</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communication styles</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s important to ask your potential roommate about how they go about confrontations or conflicts in the apartment. Do they tend to leave passive-aggressive notes? or do they prefer to talk things out face-to-face? With this information, you&#8217;ll be able to gauge if you&#8217;ll work things out should a conflict happen.</p>



<p>Once you’ve asked the major questions you wanted to ask, let them have a go at describing what they’re looking for too. Listen carefully and try to really understand what they’re saying when they’re talking about their choice of potential roommates.</p>



<p>And now like any other interview, once you’ve had a good chat, let them break free from your questions. Ask them what else they’d like for you to know, or what they’d like to know about you.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>What&#8217;s your confrontation style?</li>



<li>Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? Do you think it&#8217;s important to interact with each other every day?</li>



<li>Do you tend to leave notes?</li>



<li>Are you more of a text or call person?</li>



<li>Anything else I should know about you?</li>
</ol>

<p>Choosing a roommate is a big decision that can greatly impact your daily life, so it&#8217;s important to think carefully before making a choice. Before relocating, you have to consider what factors are most important to you in a potential roommate.</p>



<p>From cleanliness and communication to lifestyle preferences and financial responsibility, there are a myriad of things to consider when searching for the perfect roommate in 2024. By taking the time to evaluate these key factors, you can ensure a harmonious living situation and create a positive living environment for yourself and your new roommate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What To Look For In A Roommate: 10 Things to Consider</h2>



<p>The fastest way to find the wrong roommate is to have an unrealistic assessment of yourself. Make sure you have a real understanding of where you stand on things like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cleanliness</li>



<li>Weekly routine</li>



<li>Quiet hours/bedtime</li>



<li>Partying/drinking/smoking</li>



<li>Financials</li>



<li>Visitors and guests</li>



<li>Pets</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want your potential roommate to be honest about it, you need to make sure you&#8217;re being honest as well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Use Your Tools</h3>



<p>You could drive around with a realtor and look at six apartments on a Sunday, or waste an entire Saturday hosting an open house, but what if a roommate finder website could do most of the work for you and provide verified listings in a verified community – all in one place?</p>



<p>The modern sharing economy has multiple ways to find a host of rooms and roommates online. Some are great and some are not so great – and while we won’t go through every single one, we’ll let you know what to look out for and introduce some of the tools that you can take advantage of.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Compatibility Matching</h3>

<p>Answer a series of questions about yourself including your likes, dislikes, and other pertinent information to living with someone, and then search for someone based on their answers to the same questions. Not only will you save time searching for a compatible roommate, but you’ll also have a greater probability that you won’t be looking for a new roommate in a month. That’s a win-win.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Background Checks</h3>



<p>While there are certain laws around employment and landlord background checks, for roommate checks, you&#8217;re kind of on your own to find a credible service.</p>



<p>The good news is that some roommate finder websites include background check options. On Roomi, for example, many of your matches may already have completed background checks so you can be more confident in striking up a conversation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Lifestyle</h3>

<p>Lifestyle includes daily routines or habits, sleep schedules, food preferences, allergies, and more. You don&#8217;t need to have the same lifestyle as your roommate, but it&#8217;s good to know whether you&#8217;ll have the same or at least similar to theirs. This way, you&#8217;ll have an understanding of how they are at home and outside of work.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Cleanliness</h3>



<p>Coming home to unwashed dishes, a dusty floor, and a full garbage can can be stressful. So, it&#8217;s important to find a roommate who takes cleaning as seriously as you do. Before committing to anything, make sure both of you are in agreement on how to clean your shared living spaces.</p>



<p>Aside from the cleanliness at home, personal hygiene is as important. You wouldn&#8217;t want to live with a person who doesn&#8217;t take their hygiene seriously and tends to smell after a few days.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Finances</h3>



<p>Money can be difficult to discuss and if you’re splitting rent and expenses, it&#8217;s not a topic that could easily be parked and returned to when you feel like it.</p>

<p>You may want to get proof of employment to ensure your future roommate will have an income to pay rent. Also, a simple credit check can not only tell you if a potential roommate has a history of paying their debts but can also uncover any prior evictions and mounting credit card debt – both of which may be red flags.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a tip: ask for a deposit. A deposit proves a roommate is serious and willing to put some skin in the game. It also protects everyone else if the roommate decides to flake out. Some sites like Roomi will help facilitate the first month’s rent to provide some extra security to all parties.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Guests</h3>



<p>One of the most underrated things to consider when choosing a roommate is what they think about guests in the apartment. Like friends coming over to visit, family members, and even romantic partners.</p>



<p>If you like hosting small gatherings or parties, your roommates must be okay with it too. It also has to be clear on who are the guests coming over and how long they plan on staying.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Values and Priorities</h3>



<p>Finding a roommate with the same or similar values and priorities as you is necessary to have a healthy co-living situation. Live with someone you can be friends with, someone you get along with easily so that you don&#8217;t encounter any problems in the near future.</p>

<p>Make sure to talk about quiet hours in the apartment, how to handle household chores, boundaries, and everything essential.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. References</h3>



<p>Is your new prospective roommate looking for a new place because they got kicked out of their last apartment? Well, wouldn’t&nbsp;you&nbsp;like to know! It’s totally reasonable to ask for a few references from former roommates. Aim to get an email and phone number for 2-3 references, and be sure it includes past roommates. People tend to divulge more in conversation, so try a phone call first.</p>



<p>And with the finances section above, you should also consider using your prospective roommate’s employer as a reference.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">10. Clarify the Little Things</h3>



<p>I know you’re in a hurry to move in or fill the empty room but if you don’t do it right, you may be going through the entire process again in just a few months. Make sure you get all the little things on the table so everyone is clear on whether or not you have a good mutual fit.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The exact cost of rent</li>



<li>The estimated cost of utilities</li>



<li>How long everyone is planning on staying</li>



<li>What furniture to bring/not bring (including silverware, plates, etc.)</li>



<li>Will any pets be moving in?</li>



<li>Food and how the refrigerator will be shared.</li>



<li>Parking!</li>



<li>Significant others and sleepover frequency.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time to Find a Roommate!</h2>



<p>Choosing the right roommate can make a huge difference in your living situation. With these ten considerations in mind, you can find the perfect match for your living situation in 2024. From cleanliness to social habits, there are many factors to take into account.</p>

<p>Roomi also conducts background checks and ID verification to avoid fraud and scams. Plus, in-app messaging to ensure that the conversations you&#8217;re having are safe and secure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-look-for-roommates-through-facebook-or-craigslist">2. Look for roommates through Facebook or Craigslist</h3>



<p>Before roommate finder apps and websites existed, Facebook, Craigslist, and even Reddit were the go-to platforms. It&#8217;s a bit old school as numerous people just post statuses that say: <em>&#8216;looking for roommates!&#8217;</em> and hope that someone they&#8217;ll eventually get along with answers.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it&#8217;s still effective, but you have to take precautions as there are a lot of scammers and fake profiles that can trick you if you&#8217;re not careful. To avoid this, be specific with your listing, and once you&#8217;re talking to a potential roomie, call them through video call (to ensure they&#8217;re actually the one in the profile!).</p>

<p>Roommate flyers may seem old-fashioned, but it&#8217;s never out of style. Sticking roommate flyers or posters on public bulletin boards, residence halls, lamp posts, walls, etc., is still as effective as posting a listing online. Just make sure that you have permission to stick your flyer in different places. </p>



<p>Roomi Tip: Be specific about the roommate that you&#8217;re looking for in your flyer. List down the specific qualities you&#8217;re looking for and the dealbreakers. This way, people will know if they fit the criteria or not.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-ask-friends-and-family">4. Ask friends and family</h3>



<p>A roommate doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be a stranger. You can ask family members and close friends if you have any around the area to be your roommate. Having a roommate who you already know and trust makes the prospect of living together more enjoyable.</p>



<p>However, some also advise against living with a close friend or relative as arguments or misunderstandings may happen. There may be disagreements that can become too personal and lead to a broken relationship. Still, all these can be avoided with proper communication.</p>



<p>If not friends and family themselves, maybe they know someone who&#8217;s also looking for a roommate and they can refer you. New York&#8217;s a big city with over 19 million people living in the city, it&#8217;s impossible that you wouldn&#8217;t be able to find a roommate!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-go-to-mixers-and-meetups-and-network-with-potential-roommates">5. Go to Mixers and Meetups and network with potential roommates</h3>



<p>Mixers and meetups in New York are common: it happens almost every week with different groups all around the city. Specifically, there are meetup events and roommate mixers hosted by local community organizations, apartment complexes, or social networking groups that you can attend.</p>



<p>This way, you get to meet your potential roommates in person, talk to them, get a feel of their vibe, and see if you&#8217;ll get along well. More than that, these events are a sure way of avoiding scammers and fake online profiles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-hard-is-it-to-find-a-roommate-in-nyc-well">How Hard Is It to Find a Roommate in NYC? Well&#8230;</h2>



<p>Finding a roommate in NYC may seem like a daunting task, but it&#8217;s definitely achievable. With a positive attitude, thorough research, and a bit of patience, you can find the perfect roommate to share your NYC adventure with.</p>



<p>Attend local events, utilize online platforms, and network with friends and colleagues to increase your chances of finding a compatible roommate.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Values communication</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Supports and encourages you</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Is not a hoarder</h2>

So an ideal roommate should be on the same level as you on such matters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Shares responsibilities</h2>



<p>Unless you’re okay with being a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/takeaways-from-an-iconic-coliving-relationship-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monica to your Rachel</a> like in <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/where-are-the-actual-tv-show-sets-of-nyc-sitcoms/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the sitcom</a>, it’s ideal to split responsibilities.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What fictional character would be your ideal roommate?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gina Linetti (Brooklyn 99)</strong></h3>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Gina is a cool, confident woman who believes in herself the most. But imagine living with someone like her, watching her own the room whenever she walks in and letting all that confidence rub off on you, so you can learn to be a boss, just like her. Doesn’t that sound like the perfect roommate?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to find the ideal roommate</h2>



<p>Let’s face it, it’s 2021 and we get all of our information online. The difference now is that you might have found choices to be limited due to the pandemic. The good news is that this seems to be changing. At Roomi, we noticed that many people were moving away from the city at the start of the pandemic, but Covid effects on the rental market are leveling out.</p>

<p>So you&#8217;re finally moving out and heading to college. With people from all backgrounds and walks of life coming together, there are many types of college roommates you will meet. Whether it is your dorm roommate or flatmates, be prepared to meet some interesting people! Here is a guide to the common types of roommates you will meet and how to deal with them.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate/">Looking for a roommate? Here are some qualities to look for!</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of roommates in college</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. The introverts:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l3V0dbWcERDPRglkA" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3V0dbWcERDPRglkA/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>They are the quiet ones who like to go about their lives without interrupting yours and can seem quite enigmatic. Having a small and close friend circle, they need time to warm up to people before opening up to them. If your flat or dorm roommate falls into this type, you will need to respect their space and privacy. Make an effort to understand them better and talk to them, but do not be pushy or put them in awkward situations! Introverts can be great friends once you get to know them better.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/kDND93uMTfsMOvvmqx" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/kDND93uMTfsMOvvmqx/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. The life of the party:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:83%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/U4DswrBiaz0p67ZweH" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/U4DswrBiaz0p67ZweH/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>These types of roommates in college are the very opposite of the introverts. They love chatting and opening up while getting to know new people. Everyone loves them and they bring fun and cheer to any conversation or gathering. These people can always be seen with a crowd around them and seem to have an aura that attracts everyone to them. They are great friends to have around and are always willing to have a conversation and are naturals are having some fun.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. The straight A&#8217;s student:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l0HlHFRbmaZtBRhXG" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlHFRbmaZtBRhXG/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Another one of the types of roommates in college is the smart kid. They are always on time for classes and can be found in the library reading up in their free time. Often stereotyped for being nerdy, they are actually very hardworking and determined to succeed. They are great friends to have around and will remind you to study for that test, and keep you focused on your academics.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. The carefree one:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:66%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/H7kfFDvD9HSYGRbvid" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/H7kfFDvD9HSYGRbvid/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Quite an interesting one when it comes to the different types of roommates, as they seem to be chilled out all the time. Whether it is that upcoming test, assignment, or the time crunch for submissions, they are always at ease. They can be great friends and their example teaches you to stay calm and take a chill pill from time to time.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. The social butterfly:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/fY5M0XMiE911HLOkd5" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/fY5M0XMiE911HLOkd5/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>It may have been just a week since college started, but these types of roommates already seem to know everyone. You can spot them introducing themselves to new people and happily chatting with their newly made friends. Everyone seems to know and like them, and they thrive in the social spotlight. These friends can help you improve your social skills and teach you to network better.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. The parent:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/J20qFQarWK3XMwhdfi" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/J20qFQarWK3XMwhdfi/giphy.gif"></iframe>

<p>These types of college roommates are the parent of the group and will babysit the entire group. They are the responsible ones who will make sure you keep your room clean and take care of yourself. There is a lot to learn from them, and they are usually caring, mature and great people to be friends with.</p>

<p>To answer the question on many people&#8217;s minds: &#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t rain all the time.&#8221; Seattle gets less rain annually than Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Miami, and many other major metro areas. The natural beauty of Seattle is breathtaking too! It&#8217;s surrounded by both mountains and water on two sides – is one of the biggest draws for residents.</p>



<p>The scenery and proximity to nature, perhaps, contribute to Seattle&#8217;s inherent attitude: one of calm and patience. Locals are mocked for always allowing others to merge on the freeway. Still, that attitude extends to everyday life, where coffee shops harbor intellectual discussions, and nightlife is more about chilling with a beer at the bar than wild nights on the dance floor.</p>



<p>For many, living in Seattle has as much to do with what&#8217;s outside the city proper as what&#8217;s inside. Less than an hour from downtown, residents escape for the day or weekend to wineries, ski resorts, hiking trails, and sprawling parks. Seattleites bring that love of nature into the city proper as much as possible, enjoying Seattle&#8217;s parks and tree-lined streets while staying cozy in fleece jackets (practically the local uniform).</p>

<p>A single person estimated monthly costs are 1,163.46$ without rent — which is why it may be beneficial to find roommates in Seattle, after all. According to data from <a href="http://numbeo.com/">Numbeo</a>, a meal at a typical Seattle dining establishment costs about $30 per person, compared to the $25 national average. However, there are also plenty of open-air farmers&#8217; markets that run from spring through autumn here, where you may be able to find great deals on fresh produce.</p>



<p>While Seattle does have a light rail system, it only serves a limited portion of the city. Most Seattleites either own a car or use the public bus system. The city also has a large contingent of cyclists, but given the number of hills and the lousy winter weather, it takes a high level of commitment to rely on a bike year-round.</p>



<p>It isn’t all bad news for current and future Seattle residents, though. There’s one important commodity which is cheaper in this city than almost anywhere else in the country: electricity. This is due in large part to a number of major hydroelectric power plants throughout the state.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-s-what-to-keep-in-mind">Here’s What to Keep in Mind</h2>



<p>Understanding the needs and expectations of your roommates can help you build good co-living situations. But when you’re rooming with a member of the LGBTQ+ community, <a href="https://www.glaad.org/resources/ally/2" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">being a good Ally</a> is just as important as being a good roommate.</p>

<p>Whether you’re sharing an apartment with your roommate, or living in a college dorm, it is a personal space. Hence, it is crucial that you both feel comfortable and at home. Being <a href="https://www.queertheology.com/tag/trans-allies/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a good ally</a> and a supportive roommate is, thus, crucial to ensure that your roommate feels at ease.</p>

<p>While Allies usually mean well, lack of knowledge or familiarity with the LGBTQ+ community can inevitably make for some awkward situations. When you want to ensure that you’re a Queer-friendly roommate, keeping a few terms and concepts in mind can help you understand them better.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-difference-between-gender-trans-and-non-binary">Understanding the Difference Between Gender, Trans and Non-binary</h2>



<p>Language is a powerful tool, but sometimes, we can unknowingly hurt people with the words we use. Language within the LGBTQ+ community can be diverse, and when you want to be a LGTBQ+ friendly roommate, understanding different terms can help you make your transgender, non-binary, lesbian or gay roommate feel at ease.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-gender">What is Gender?</h3>



<p>Gender is an internal sense of self which can be expressed in several ways, commonly through clothing, pronouns and behavior. Often, gender is linked to stereotypical ideas of femininity and masculinity. Gender is what you feel you are, whether it is male, female, or having no strong feelings towards any gender.</p>



<p>Some people identify with the same gender they were assigned at birth. This is known as being cisgender. Some people feel that they are a different gender than what they were assigned at birth. They may identify as transgender or non-binary.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-trans">What is Trans?</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.glaad.org/transgender/transfaq" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trans or transgender</a> is an inclusive umbrella term. With this term people can either refer to a transman, transwoman, people who cross-dress or even non-binary people. Broadly, it is used to refer to anyone who does not identify as cisgender.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-non-binary">What is Non-binary?</h3>



<p>Those who feel that their sense of gender cannot be defined by the traditional gender binary use the term non-binary. For them, their understanding of their gender can go beyond a sense of feeling like a man or a woman. While some non-binary people may feel comfortable in trans communities, as it is a way of meeting non-cisgender people, it is not true for everyone.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this is not all there is to learn about gender and gender-expression, but it is a good place to start. Interacting with more people of the community and keeping an open mind can help you learn more about the different ways in which people identify themselves.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-be-a-good-ally-what-you-should-know">How to Be a Good Ally: What You Should Know</h2>



<p>While you may consider yourself to be queer or LGBTQ+ friendly, expressing it is important. You should not only be supportive of your gay roommate, but make them feel comfortable as well. Every person is unique; hence, it is important not to generalize one person’s experience to the entire community.</p>



<p>Just as you would assume that every straight person does not behave the same way, it is important to remember that every transgender person may not be the same.</p>



<p>So, how can you become a better ally to make your transgender roommate feel comfortable?</p>

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-assume-their-sexual-orientation">Don’t Assume Their Sexual Orientation</h3>



<p>Often, people confuse gender identity and sexual orientation. Gender identity is the expression and sense of self, but sexual orientation refers to who people are attracted to. Transgender people can identify as straight, gay, lesbian or bisexual.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-use-correct-pronouns">Use Correct Pronouns</h3>



<p>When referring to your roommate, ensure that you use the right pronouns. If you aren’t sure which pronouns to use, you can either listen to what pronouns others use for them, or ask them yourself. A good example of asking for pronouns would be, “Hi, my name is __, I use he/she and her/him. What about you?” If you accidentally use the wrong pronouns, ensure that you apologize, but move on from the situation and not make it a big deal.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-ask-them-for-their-birth-name-or-real-name">Don’t Ask Them for Their Birth Name or Real Name</h3>



<p>If someone introduced themselves to you, you wouldn’t ask them if it was their “real name”, and it shouldn’t be different for transgender people as well. Some transgender people continue to use their birth name, while others feel that it is a part of their life they want to leave behind. If you happen to know someone’s name before they transitioned, do not share it without their permission.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-be-patient">Be Patient</h3>



<p>Everyone is trying to figure out their place in the world, and whether they are a member of the LGBTQ+ community or not. While we may not understand other people’s experiences, it is essential to be patient with them, no matter who they are. Ensure that you listen to your roommate, understand their needs and provide them with a listening ear. This tip is useful even if you aren’t living with a gay roommate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is Living in Hawaii Expensive?</h2>



<p>If you have done a bit of research about moving to Hawaii, you’ve probably come across numerous posts talking about <a href="https://www.dwellhawaii.com/blog/what-cost-living-hawaii-2020/">how expensive living on the islands are</a>. But, is it really true?</p>



<p>Housing in Hawaii can be expensive; after all, it is an island state so they have no way to expand. Every year, thousands of people move to these beautiful islands, increasing the demand for housing. Hence, it is not unusual for people to start looking for roommates in Hawaii, or opt for room shares. Affordable housing is scarce, but the view will make up for it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is It Like Living in Hawaii?</h2>



<p>Before we delve into how you can find a roommate in Hawaii, why not explore what living in Hawaii is actually like? Living on the Hawaiian Islands is much different than what you would imagine. Residents do not go out surfing every day, nor do they spend their days lazing about on the beach.</p>



<p>Here’s what you can expect when living in Hawaii:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Being Surrounded by Hawaiian Wildlife</h3>



<p>Do you like to explore nature and its lovely creatures? Well, between whales, birds, turtles and more, you will never be too far from wildlife. You don’t even need to head to the beaches or mountains to catch a glimpse of these creatures, birds and turtles may pop-up in your backyard as well!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Get Ready for Island Hopping</h3>



<p>No matter which Hawaiian Island you live in, you will explore the rest easily. Travelling to different islands is easy; make sure to ask colleagues and friends about which places you should visit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t Be Fooled by the Paradise of the Pacific Tag</h3>



<p>What you have heard about Hawaii might be far from the truth. While there is a beautiful ocean view to enjoy, you won’t be spending much time actually surfing the waves. Traffic is bad, and crimes still occurs. It is not as easy-breezy as it sounds. Despite it although, locals love living here, and most regret it when they decide to leave for good.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Go to Trusted Sources</h3>



<p>If you already know people in Hawaii, it can be easier to find trustworthy roommates who will not bail on you at the last minute. But with no recommendations, finding roommates can be challenging. Visiting trusted websites or using recommended apps is the next best solution. In popular places like Honolulu, finding roommates using these applications is easier as you have numerous options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Multiple Interviews Are Necessary</h3>



<p>Living with another person is difficult; there’s a lot of adjustment involved. A single meeting is not enough to know whether you are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/ways-to-make-a-new-roommate-feel-welcome-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">compatible with another person.</a> Make sure you meet them more than once and ask them everything that you would want to know about a future roommate!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing Payment Agreement</h3>



<p>Living in Hawaii is expensive; hence, you have to be upfront about costs. Make sure you decide which bills are to be split and which ones will be covered individually. Establishing payment agreements is crucial and helps both parties express their expectations from the other.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ensure You Have A Written Agreement</h3>



<p>No matter how trustworthy your roommate may be, it is always best to keep a written agreement in hand, especially when opting for roomshares in Hawaii. Keep a record of expected payments and payment dates, expectations for your roommates and any other conditions you may have. Establishing rules helps you both feel comfortable when at home, and can help in avoiding conflicts as well.</p>



<p>Living with roommates can be fun, but only when you are compatible with them. In Hawaii, you cannot avoid living with roommates, so make sure that you find someone that you can get along with.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Transit Friendly Is Manhattan</h2>



<p>Getting around in Manhattan is easy due to an abundance of public transportation and a simple street grid. Walking, traveling the subway, taking a bus or cab are the most common ways to move around in Manhattan, some still wish to have their private vehicles or use a different means.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Walkability </h3>



<p> Manhattan is the easiest city to travel by foot, and many pedestrians take advantage of this fact. There are many pre-packaged walking tours, some are free but most are very cheap. If you go out on your own, <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Manhattan">counting on 20 blocks</a> equals a mile and taking 20 to 30 minutes to <a href="http://walk.It">walk.It</a> is the easiest to navigate through when looking for rooms for rent in Manhattan</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Roads/Traffic</h3>



<p>To avoid traffic, tune in to local stations with traffic updates on the Morning radio. Avoid roads and areas with heavy construction. traveling in and out of Manhattan between 8-9 a.m. and 3-7 p.m. are the toughest. If you can, try to avoid rush hour or consider some alternate routes. Many areas are blocked off from traffic and street festivals which run through spring, summer, and fall close-off avenues. Visitors that rent or bring in their cars park it due to the stress that comes from struggling to park.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Taxis</h3>



<p>Rather than own a car, most Manhattans prefer to use a car service app because it’s more convenient. Manhattan cabs are yellow. Cab fares are strictly by meter, it is essentially that you give a 10% to 15% tip. Also note that the responsibility for tolls are on you. The difference between an available taxi and off duty taxi is their lights, it’s taxi sign light is on when available and dimmed when off duty and shift change. It’s worthy of note that taxis can be inefficient during rush hour. Available <a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/cheapest-car-services-in-nyc">car service apps</a> are LYFT, UBER, GETT and VIA.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Airport</h3>



<p>From Times Square, it’ll take you about 30 minutes to get to JFK International Airport which is located in the borough of Queens approximately 19km southeast of Lower Manhattan.
