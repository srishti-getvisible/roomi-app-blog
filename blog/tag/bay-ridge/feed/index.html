<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay Ridge neighborhood is an easily missed neighborhood with a small-town feel, sitting securely amidst the organized chaos of New York City. Located in <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/know-live-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Brooklyn</a> and snuggled up against the Upper and Lower Bay of the Hudson River, this area offers a low key place to live with access to fast paced places to work. A</span>dditionally, g<span style="font-weight: 400;">etting to Manhattan’s Union State takes</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">40 minutes, which might be a bit much for some. But it also ensures that the low cost of living in the area stays that way. So here&#8217;s Roomi&#8217;s complete Bay Ridge neighborhood review!</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>What do bicyclists, runners, and stunning seashore views have in common?</b></h2>



<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay Ridge neighborhood, as it turns out. This is a great part of town to rent a bike and cruise around, take in glistening views of the bay, watch elegant ferries float along. </span>S<span style="font-weight: 400;">top to take in the sunset with the live action soundtrack of seagulls calling in the background.</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/shore-road-park" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Shore Park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has an especially nice bike path if you want to go for a ride. Also, there are some entertaining and at times intense</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city/travel-tips-and-articles/bay-ridge-an-oasis-in-the-urban-jungle-of-new-york-city/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d277b7d9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">pick-up basketball games</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be had if you’re feeling up to it.</span></p>

<p>And i<span style="font-weight: 400;">f jogging or walking is more your thing, there are some nice, quiet parks to enjoy in the Bay Ridge neighborhood.</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/owls-head-park" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Owl’s Head Park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has gently rolling hills and views of the gorgeous</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://web.mta.info/bandt/html/veraz.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Verrazano Narrows Bridge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that connects Brooklyn with Staten Island. It’s also a sweet spot for a picnic or a low-key game of Frisbee if you want to relax. The shade of the park’s plentiful trees is just made for lying in.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Affordable and amazing food: What small towns do best</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody does great eats that are easy on the wallet like small towns. Nobody. In fact, the Bay Ridge neighborhood has a great mix of Irish, Italian, and Arabic residents and the many delicious restaurants to prove it.</span></p>



<p><a href="http://www.wickedmonk.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wicked Monk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Bay Ridge neighborhood offers fantastic food and beer in a unique atmosphere, which has a cathedral-turned-pub feel to it. </span>Moreover, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">hey have great choices for lunch, brunch, dinner, and special late options for night owls. It also hosts live events from music to MMA.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle Eastern food enthusiasts can head right on over to the</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.tanoreen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanoreen </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the Bay Ridge neighborhood. Additionally, they have amazing options for dining in and offer catering services. For dessert, try the house special knafeh. Crispy layers of fillo filled dough filled with sweet cream cheese, soaked in orange blossom syrup and topped with crunchy pistachios. That blurs the line between food and a magic trick.</span></p>



<p>For<span style="font-weight: 400;"> something a little classier in the Bay Ridge neighborhood, try</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://ginosbayridge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ginos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Established in 1964, they boast the best Italian food and pizza in Brooklyn for over 50 years. While that’s a pretty big claim, 50 years of happy customers is a pretty big accomplishment. Just a quick heads up, they’re closed on Mondays. But </span>that<span style="font-weight: 400;"> shouldn’t be a big deal. You didn’t really want to carb-load yourself on the first day of the work week, right?</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>The Bay Ridge neighborhood review: Affordable small town living in the big Apple</b></h2>



<p>In conclusion, the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay Ridge neighborhood has apartments starting in the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$924 range on Roomiapp.com. Moreover, it offers a chance to slow down, enjoy the ocean, and get to know your neighbors. Ditch the chain restaurants and overpriced ego-trips and become a regular at one of the delectable mom-and-pop style ethnic restaurants.</span></p>
