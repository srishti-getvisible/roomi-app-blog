<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beaches are crowded, the air conditioned malls have lines out the door, and even at night shorts and a t-shirt feels like overkill. Yup. It’s summer and you need ice cream in NYC, because finding ways to beat the heat is priority one. And one of the fastest, most enjoyable ways to do that is to find good ice cream places in NYC. So we&#8217;ve compiled a list of the best ice cream shops in NYC to help you cool down! </span></p>



<p>In brief, <span style="font-weight: 400;">there’s something universally enjoyable about ice cream. It doesn’t seem to matter if we are kids, adults, or even moody teenagers. </span>In conclusion, i<span style="font-weight: 400;">ce cream is a delicious sanctuary from the woes of the world around us. There’s something about rich, creamy, cool, refreshing ice cream that makes even the worst days more manageable. Which is why the team at Roomi compiled the best ice cream shops in NYC you can get your sweaty palms on. Enjoy!</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <b>Morgenstern’s Finest Ice Cream</b></h2>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.morgensternsnyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgenstern’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the best ice cream shops in NYC that serves small batch ice cream. The focus is on texture and flavor. Ingredients are a big deal here, so no additives or processed stabilizing is used. So this isn’t a place where you get an indecisive mix that tries to appeal to everybody, like caramel-chocolate-vanilla-bannaberry-swirl. These</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">flavors are confident, bold, direct, and know who they are. Madagascar vanilla. Burnt honey vanilla. Banana curry. Cinnamon whisky. Black coconut ash. However, these are just a few samples of ice cream in NYC with Morgenstern&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ve only got one location in the The Big Apple, by Lower Manhattan. But even if you’re not as close as you’d like, it’s worth swinging by if you’re in the area or even basing a whole trip around on a hot day. Because a trip to the best ice cream shops in NYC is always worth it. They’ve also got sorbet and ice cream cakes if you’re in the mood for something a little different.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <b>Ample Hills Creamery</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amplehills.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Creamery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is old school in every way and makes for one of the best ice cream shops in NYC. A</span>dditionally, it offers o<span style="font-weight: 400;">ld fashioned customer service that treats you like a friend the second you walk in the door. </span>In conclusion, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">hey&#8217;re one of the good ice cream places in NYC that make their ice cream by hand. The interior and graphic design have a nice, homey feel. They are very serious about quality. They craft their delectable goods with hormone free milk and cream from grass fed cows. Oh yeah, and organic cane sugar. But they’re not so serious about flavors, in a good way. Pretzel infused ice cream? Worth signing up for.</span></p>

<p>Although, <span style="font-weight: 400;">many good ice cream places in NYC serve great ice cream, not just any of them teach you how to do it yourself. Yup. That’s what makes this one of the best ice cream shops in NYC.</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amplehills.com/classes-and-socials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ice cream classes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are available at Ample Hills. Pretty fun for a date if neither of you mind getting your hands dirty and eating whatever results from your team effort. They’ve got</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a bunch of locations all over NYC, so check them out with your roommate, date, or friends.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <b>Tipsy Scoop</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/easy-cocktail-recipes-to-try-at-home-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alcohol</a> is mixed into this delicious ice cream, in amounts up to 5% ABV. Hence the name</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.tipsyscoop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tipsy Scoop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that&#8217;s what makes it one of the best ice cream shops in NYC. So this liquor-infused ice cream is a great choice if it’s a hot night and you are in-between restaurants or events. And their</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">classic flavor line says it all. Chocolate stout and pretzel. Strawberry rhubarb bourbon. Spiked mint chocolate chip. In conclusion, whatever your favorite ice cream is, and whatever adult beverage of choice you prefer, they offer something you’ll enjoy. They’ve got several locations, and recently opened up a new one on 217 East 26th Street. A great place to go with a gaggle of your friends.</span></p>
