<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Lincoln</h2>



<p>Originally a prairie covered with buffalo grass, Lincoln was first inhabited by the Pawnee tribe. It was founded in 1856 as the village of Lancaster and became the county seat of Lancaster County. Renamed after President Abraham Lincoln, it is also the seat of government for the state of Nebraska. Lincoln experiences a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_continental_climate">humid continental climate</a> as it is far from any major water bodies. It was also designated as a refugee-friendly city due to its stable economy, educational institutions, and industries.</p>
