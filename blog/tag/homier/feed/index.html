Not to mention decorating a new apartment can often mean digging deep into those pockets. But hold on, we&#8217;re here so you barely need to stress to make your new apartment feel like home!</p>



<p>Here are 8 tips to help make your new apartment feel more like home.</p>

<p>This is a super easy, affordable way to brighten up your apartment. Hanging string lights has become an increasingly popular room decor trend &#8211; and for good reason!<br>Buy a few strands of fairy lights and brighten up any space in your apartment that is looking bare. Check out Target or Home Goods for affordable string lights and decor. Get even more creative and hang up small photographs or polaroids on your string of lights using clothespins!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buy house plants! The more the merrier!</h2>

<p>Decorating your apartment with plants is both visually pleasing and budget-friendly! <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-be-a-great-plant-parent-this-fall-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop at your local grocery store and pick up a few of your favorite potted plants.</a> No worries if you don’t have a green thumb, artificial plants will do the trick too! This is also one of the easiest ways to make your apartment feel like home. Plants do a great job at cozying up a place, that is if you&#8217;re committed to taking care of them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Decorate walls with art that represents you.</h2>

<p>Make sure to include personal photographs in various rooms in order to make your new place feel homier. Photographs give us a sense of comfort and help us to feel connected with family and friends even if we aren’t physically with them. Invest in a few cute frames and hang your favorite pictures on a bare wall to give it some life.</p>

<p>Pick out a color scheme for a particular room and add decorative pillows and throws to make the room pop. If your room is looking bland, add a few colorful or patterned pillows to the room! Fuzzy throws are also a great addition to any couch or chair to make a room feel cozier. There’s no such thing as too many blankets!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Invest in a nice rug, maybe two. Or three. ?</h2>

<p>Decide what room you’ll be spending the most time in (for example, your living room) and invest in a good quality rug. Do your research and find a reputable company so your rug will last. If you’re striving for a clean and modern look for your apartment, decorating with a white or grey rug would be a great addition to any living room, and the neutral tones will never go out of style!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hang curtains, blinds, or shades. Whatever fits your aesthetic best! </h2>

<p>Hanging curtains is a perfect way to make any apartment feel homier. Once you’ve decided on your color scheme, decide what color curtains would go best in your apartment. Not only are curtains aesthetically pleasing, but they offer insulation and help keep in heat during the colder months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Put candles on display, and play with as much light as your can.</h2>
