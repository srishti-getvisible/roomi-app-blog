										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you have a passion for writing and can even make money out of it along the way, it sounds surreal. Well, of course, making it happen isn’t always simple. Finding freelance jobs for writing can be challenging even for writers with prior experience, and breaking into the business is downright puzzling. Some writers start out by searching for small freelance writing jobs online. Others work in a related business, like public relations, and have enough of a portfolio to approach past clients, and contacts.</p>



<p>One of the biggest obstacles for writers attempting to get paid for their work is <a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/freelance-writing-basics-4161521" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">finding legitimate, paid, online</a> writing jobs. It’s all too easy to stumble across freelance writing “gigs” that offer little more than exposure — which doesn’t put money in the bank. To end up with good freelance jobs let&#8217;s get down to the basics.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are freelance jobs</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple, freelance writing is the practice of writing for money. Importantly, working on one&#8217;s own and not being employed by a company or organization forms as a core aspect of freelance jobs. Freelance writers produce written content to suit the needs of their clients, either working from home or in a rented office space.</p>



<p>The advantage of having flexibility and a range of clients to work for, makes freelance job interesting. Writers can have many different clients, or, one very large client with a lot of steady, ongoing work. In freelance writing jobs, you can work as a generalist and cover topics as diverse as lifestyle or personal finance. Or, you can specialize in one specific area, such as cryptocurrency or architectural design.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Roomi Tip:</strong> Work on your portfolio and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://smartblogger.com/freelance-writing-niches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">develop your niche</a> as specialists tend to find more work and thus, earn more than generalists.</pre>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital Marketing: Trending in freelance jobs</strong></h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Technical Writing</h3>



<p>Technological knowledge are key for technical writing. These freelance writing jobs, in particular, are among the most high paying.

For instance, blockchain, software development, supply chain management, and AI.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Financial Writing: One of the highest paying freelance jobs</h3>



<p>Finance is another industry where writers are paid a premium for excellent content. While it&#8217;s not a new niche, it&#8217;s still an important industry since finance and money-saving tips can change as the markets evolve. Topics covered in this niche include credit cards, personal finance, taxes, and insurance.</p>
