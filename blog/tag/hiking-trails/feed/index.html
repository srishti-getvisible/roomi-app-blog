										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All of 2020 we spent dreaming of a world where we can roam around, conquer all our travel dreams, and finally get to breathe in the fresh air of the mountains. Living in NYC this past year, came with us missing out on a lot. But what we missed most was the outdoors. Plans of <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/visitors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">hiking during coronavirus</a> might not be the best idea, (it sucks, we know). But there&#8217;s no stopping you from planning your future hiking in New York city!</p>



<p>So when you&#8217;re daydreaming about exploring the world again, here are some of the best hikes around New York to add to your list.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Breakneck Ridge, NYC</h2>



<p>The name of this hiking trail might make you hesitant to add this one to your list but it&#8217;s worth it! According to the book <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lyAFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brief Summer Rambles Near Philadelphia</a></em> by Joel Cook, a wild bull was chased by indignant inhabitants on the mountain range, where he fell and broke his neck &#8211; hence the name!</p>



<p>Located near Cold Spring New York, the Breakneck Ridge is a short hiking trail that&#8217;s primarily used for hiking, rock climbing and trips into nature. Your pooch is allowed on the trail but should be kept on leash.</p>

<p><strong>Trail Distance:</strong> 2.5 to 3.5 miles</p>



<p><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1,250 feet</p>



<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Moderate to difficult</p>



<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2-3 hours</p>



<p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> April &#8211; October</p>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s a short hiking trail, it can be a bit of a challenge as the trail is mostly steep. However, the views are worth it! And this is one of those trails that you absolutely shouldn&#8217;t miss out on if you&#8217;re living in NYC.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a tip from <a href="https://theurbanoutdoors.com/hiking-breakneck-ridge-trail-hudson-highlands-new-york/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">The Urban Outdoors</a> for when you decide to go:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;Please note that if you type &#8220;Breakneck Ridge&#8221; into Google Maps, it will automatically direct you to the back side of the ridge. The trail system cannot be reached this way. Make sure that you are directing yourself to the address on Route 9D in Beacon.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Watkins Glen State Park Gorge Trail</h2>



<p>Living in NYC comes with a whole bunch of perks. If you&#8217;re looking for a park with hiking trails, the Watkins Glen State Park, in the village of Watkins Glen is the right choice for you.</p>



<p>Located south of Seneca Lake in Schuyler County, the park features three trails &#8211; The Southern Rim, Indian Trails and the Gorge trail.</p>



<p>The Gorge trail is the perfect hiking trail with waterfalls that run along the park across a 2-mile radius.</p>



<p>All three trails connect to New York&#8217;s Finger Lakes Trail region &#8211; an 800-mile system of trails within New York.</p>

<p><strong>Trail Distance:</strong> 2.4 miles (loop)</p>



<p><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> 1185 feet</p>



<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy &#8211; Moderate</p>



<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2 &#8211; 3 hours</p>



<p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Mid May to early November</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a tip from <a href="https://thefullpassport.com/hiking-watkins-glen-state-park/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Full Passport blog</a> regarding entry points to the trail:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;There are three entrances: Upper, South, and Main. The South Entrance deposits you in a great location to explore any of the available trails in either direction along the Gorge. (It may, however, involve some back-tracking since you’ll be entering in the middle of many of them.)</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>The Upper Entrance sits at the far western end of the park and will most likely have the least crowded paths as you first set out. This also might be the best option if you want to make a full circle without having to retrace your steps.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>For those in more of a hurry or who want to get right to the point, the Main Entrance is immediately off of Franklin Street in the town of Watkins Glen and leads right to the most popular section of the Gorge Trail.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Saranac Six</h2>



<p>The Saranac Six, as the name suggests, offers six different short and long hiking trakes near the Saranac Lakes in New York State.</p>

<p><strong>Best time to visit:</strong> April &#8211; October</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a tip from <a href="https://hikethehudsonvalley.com/hikes/constitution-marsh-indian-brook-falls/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hike The Hudson Valley&#8217;s blog</a> when you decide to visit (it involves delicious pizza!):</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;When you’re done, retrace your steps back to your car. I tried opening the door to the Audubon Society building (the sign said “Open”) on our way out, but the door was locked. Not sure what’s in there, but the people who run this place sure do a nice job of maintaining it. Thank them if you get a chance. And if you’re not on your way to another hike in the area, a stroll around the shops on Market Street in Cold Spring might be a perfect way to end the day (we stuffed our faces at Cold Spring Pizza and didn’t regret it for a second).&#8221;</em></strong></p>
