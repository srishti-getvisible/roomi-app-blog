<p>The county seat of Ada County, Boise, is the capital and the most populous city in Idaho State. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090930214321/http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference%20Series/0032.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Idaho State Historical Society &#8211; Reference Series</a>, during the early 1800s an exploration party trekking through the dry, rough landscape, reached an overlook with a view of the Boise River. As claimed in the story, a French-speaking guide impressed by the sight of the verdurous river, yelled, &#8220;Les bois! Les bois!&#8221; (&#8220;The woods! The woods!&#8221;)—and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise,_Idaho#Etymology" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">name stuck</a>.</p>

<p>Living on-campus doesn&#8217;t curtail freedom; it fosters discipline and accountability. Unless, of course, you already have these traits covered and are raring to apply them to real life. If you are, look for rooms for rent in Boise, ID near your chosen university, and live affordably off-campus.</p>

<p>As the city expands and its popularity grows, the traffic has increased considerably. The city somewhat lacks convenient, pocket-friendly public transit options. However, it&#8217;s an exceptionally walk and bike-friendly city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability &amp; bike-ability</h3>



<p>The Downtown area has pathways and bikeways all over. With a walk score of 88 out of 100 and 99 for bike-ability, the city certainly promotes sustainable commuting options!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Roads/traffic</h3>



<p>Over the years traffic has increased incredibly. Morning rush hour (7:00.am to 8:30.am) is heavy all the way through. More often than not, the traffic out-flow is pretty hectic in comparison to the return traffic in-flow. In <a href="https://idahonews.com/news/local/boise-ranks-16th-in-traffic-congestion-level-ahead-of-other-major-cities" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Idaho News</a>, the city ranked 16 in traffic congestion levels. Hear from a local Boisean in the video below to learn more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis</h3>



<p>Taxis are available on call-in. Any local taxi service will have local drivers familiar with shortcuts and sidelines during rush hours. A few taxi services available noted for your ease.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="http://boisecitytaxi.com" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boise City Taxi</a> &#8211; (208) 377-3333</li><li><a href="http://boiseairporttaxis.com" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boise Airport Taxi &#8211;</a> (208) 795-7777</li><li><a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lyft</a></li><li><a href="http://uber.com" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Uber</a></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public Transportation</h3>

You can rent bikes and scooters, find bus services in your area, and source phone numbers for taxis and rental services too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Airport</h3>
