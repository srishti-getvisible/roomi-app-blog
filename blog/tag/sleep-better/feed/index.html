<p>Getting better sleep will help you be more productive in the morning. There are many reasons as to why we might have trouble hitting the hay. With the continued weight of the pandemic, stress and anxiety are at an all time high, and it can be difficult to wind down after a stressful day at work. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-tips-for-anxiety-and-stress-management-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take a deep breath and stop stressing!</a>  </p>



<p>Here are 4 tips to help you sleep better throughout the night and improve sleep quality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Put down the electronics to sleep better!</h2>



<p>It can be tempting to stay up and watch late night episodes of our favorite Netflix shows, or scroll through Insta and dream of one day visiting the spots in all the #wanderlust posts. However, exposure to electronics late at night can harm our ability to fall asleep, and disturb us throughout the night. Nighttime light exposure decreases our body’s melatonin levels &#8211; a hormone produced by the brain to help us fall asleep.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" data-attachment-id="10433" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-tips-for-a-better-nights-sleep/attachment/better-sleep/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1253&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1880,1253" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="better-sleep" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman keeping her phone down to improve sleep quality" class="wp-image-10433" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>To improve sleep quality keep your shut-eye in tact! For minimizing your light exposure at night, be sure to turn off electronics at least an hour before you plan to go to bed. Turn then off completely &#8211; so you aren’t tempted to open your computer back up and eye up your work emails. </p>



<p>Set an alarm to remind yourself to power off! Want to reduce harmful electronic light exposure during the day? Try using blue light glasses in order to minimize the effects that blue light has on our eyesight, and our sleep.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Skip the coffee to improve sleep quality</h2>



<p>A cup of coffee in the morning is a necessity for most of us in order to get through a long workday. However, drinking coffee later on in the day can harm our ability to fall asleep at night. Caffeine stimulates our nervous systems and as a result interferes with our body’s ability to fall asleep. Be sure to stop consuming caffeine by 3:00 pm or 4:00 pm so you sleep better at night. Craving a warm drink later in the day? Switch out coffee for a decaffeinated tea instead!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Avoid long naps during the day to sleep better at night</h2>



<p>Taking a nap during the day can be beneficial if we had a terrible night’s sleep or if we’re feeling under the weather. However, consistent or long naps during the day can throw off our body’s internal clock when it’s time for bed. Instead of taking a long nap, take a short 20-minute power nap. Or, (if it’s before 3:00 pm), have another cup of coffee to wake yourself up and power through the day. The effects of napping are different for each individual. However, if you’re a big napper and realize that your sleep is disrupted at night, try going to bed earlier instead of napping during the day!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Treat yourself!</h2>



<p>It can often be difficult to wind down after a long day at work or if we’re feeling stressed or anxious. It’s crucial to have downtime at the end of the day so our bodies are able to relax and so we can sleep better. </p>
