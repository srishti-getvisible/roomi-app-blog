<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s one thing you learn when you visit NYC, or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sharing-an-apartment-with-a-foreign-roommate-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been living here</a> is that there are so many things that you can experience here that you simply can’t anywhere else in the world. A pizza place may say they have NYC-style pizza, but the truth is that nothing beats an authentic NYC pizza. And the list of NYC tourist locations is of course, endless! So we’re going to take a look at just a few tourist attractions in NYC.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Head to <b>Broadway</b> when you visit NYC, or live here!</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing beats a true Broadway show when you visit NYC</span>. A<span style="font-weight: 400;">nd if you’re a New Yorker, it’s easy to take this NYC tourist location for granted. </span>B<span style="font-weight: 400;">ut be sure to check in often to see what’s showing. Broadway has seen some of the world’s biggest stars pass through it</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> This includes Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and Daniel Radcliffe, so you never know who you’re going to get a chance to see live.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Go see <b>the Statue of Liberty</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overlooking NYC from her post on Liberty Island is the Statue of Liberty. She’s a constant reminder for</span> those<span style="font-weight: 400;"> who visit NYC</span>, or have been living here,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the American way of life. If you haven’t paid the tourist attraction in NYC, Statue of Liberty a visit yet, be sure to do so as it’s certainly something that you can’t find anywhere else.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Spend a day at <b>the Metropolitan Art Museum</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most often referred to as “the Met,” this is one of the NYC tourist locations that was first established back in 1870 and has since housed artwork from around the world going back over 5,000 years. Their exhibits can be found in three distinct locations and as they’re always bringing in new exhibits, there’s always something new to see when you visit NYC. If you’re living in NYC, </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/join-and-give/membership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting a membership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will let you in for free as often as you want.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Go up the <b>Empire State Building</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry. We didn’t forget this one; we were just saving one of the most popular NYC tourist locations for last. After all, it is one of the 7 wonders of the world, and certainly one of the first things that comes to mind when you visit NYC. H</span>ost to mostly office spaces, the <span style="font-weight: 400;">top 16 levels are the Art Deco towers. So if you’re living in NYC and haven’t gone up to the observatory at the top of the Empire State Building by now, what are you waiting for?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Races in NYC don’t have to be full blown marathons that require you to train for months at the exclusion of your social life and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/5-tried-tested-tips-to-naturally-fall-asleep-faster-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep</a>. You don’t have to get up at crack-o-dawn AM just to run laps in Central Park until you drop to have a good time on a 5 kilometer (5K) run. Additionally, fun races in NYC are a great way to practice fitness in NYC and do some light training with a roommate or grab some mutual friends, and just have a goofy good time participating in a</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.refinery29.com/best-beginner-races" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">beginner event.</span></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Races in NYC can also be walked if you don’t want to run. Still, these events are 5K long, so you still need to know your fitness level and do an appropriate amount of training. And consult an expert to figure out how much training that is.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <b>The Color Run</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty much exactly what it sounds like.</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://thecolorrun.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Color Run</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rules are pretty simple. </span>So at<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the start, wear white. A</span>nd a<span style="font-weight: 400;">t the finish</span> line<span style="font-weight: 400;">, y</span>ou should <span style="font-weight: 400;">look like you were practicing gymnastics in an art supply store. People in the race and on the sidelines are just throwing colored powders left and right. It’s a rainbow, prismatic free-for-all,</span> making it one of the most fun races in NYC<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also called “The Happiest 5K On The Planet,” there is a very strong unicorn theme at this event. You can get your pictures taken with giant unicorns, which makes for a fun shareable memory. Over 6 million people have done this race, so it’s tried and tested as one of the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">best fun fitness races in NYC.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <b>Cupids Undie Run</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yup, races in NYC can get absurd!</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cupidsundierun.org/cupids-marketing/post-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Run in your underwear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A great choice when NYC is really hot. While some people literally prance about in their skivvies, other people get into costumes, and it gets to be a lot of fun. M</span>oreover, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">proceeds benefit the Children’s Tumor Foundation to help neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on nerves throughout the body. So have a blast and take heart knowing your racing fees went to a good cause.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <b>New York Hot Dog Challenge</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No need to double-back for these races in NYC, you read that right. New York City combines a friendly race with a hot dog eating contest. At the same time</span>! Also, p<span style="font-weight: 400;">eople </span>like to <span style="font-weight: 400;">dress as their favorite sack of mystery meat as they cruise down the road.</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://greatist.com/fitness/21-most-incredible-themed-races" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2.5 mile run</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through New York’s Central Park, Midtown, and Times Square is accompanied by 10 eagerly awaiting hot dog carts. D</span>uring the race, c<span style="font-weight: 400;">ontestants have to eat their way to fame, glory, and possibly one seriously upset stomach. Even if this one isn’t for you, you might be able to encourage your roommate to do it and enjoy the show. Or, uh . . . be supportive on race day. Yeah, that’s it</span>.</p>
