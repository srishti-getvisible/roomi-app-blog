										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 has been one hell of a year. From the pandemic to the recession to the fact we still don’t really know when things will go back to normal &#8211; there’s a lot to feel bad about this year. But as the year draws to a close, we&#8217;d like to propose a Christmas drink (or drinks) to a more positive 2021.Throwing a big holiday bash is out of the question, but whoever said you need a big party to try out some great Christmas cocktails? Whether you’re celebrating a lowkey Christmas with your roommates or your family, these cocktail ideas will start help you kick off 2021 on a great note!</p>



<p>So get ready to hone your bartending skills and end this year with a bang!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The king of Christmas drinks: Classic eggnog</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s no drink as synonymous with Christmas as eggnog. It’s a classic Christmas drink, without which any gathering just doesn&#8217;t feel right. Have it in the morning or at night; it’s one of those rare drinks that is socially acceptable to drink absolutely whenever you want. And those are the kind of cocktail ideas that you need to ring in 2021. <em>Moreover,</em> you can make it with ingredients that are probably already in your fridge. The most perfect drink for Christmas? We think so.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Christmas Punch</h2>



<p>Punch is a staple of just about any party &#8211; it’s easy to serve and can be made in bulk. While it might be unsafe to share a punch bowl with strangers or even acquaintances during a pandemic, that doesn’t mean you can’t make a Christmas punch for the people you live with. A punch is the most convenient of all drinks- once it’s prepared, no one has to worry about making it again and again. You are free to help yourself to the punch as you like. Plus, it’s one of the most festive drinks out there. Go stock up on some fruits to create your punch just as you like it. This is one of those cocktail ideas that&#8217;ll really start your 2021 well!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Caramel Apple Hot Toddy Cocktail</h2>



<p>Okay, if the name alone doesn’t convince you to make this amazing cocktail, you need to check your priorities. This drink has absolutely everything you could ever want in a winter cocktail- it’s warm, it has cinnamon, it has whipped cream and of course, it has bourbon. This is basically the cocktail version of curling up under a blanket. Give this a chance and we promise you won&#8217;t regret it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of the greatest Christmas drinks: Mulled Wine</h2>



<p>You know that warm, pleasant feeling you get whenever you walk into a bakery? The aroma from all those freshly baked goods can make any place feel like heaven. Well, what if I told you that this wine will make you feel exactly like that? There’s something about the combination of red wine, cinnamon, brandy and honey over heat that makes you feel like you’re living in a cottage core fantasyland. Mulled wine is unbelievably easy to make and your house will smell like an artisanal bakery afterwards. This is a quintessential Christmas drinks that you need to try!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magical Christmas drinks: Butterbeer Punch</h2>



<p>This one’s for the Potterheads in the house. I’m sure anyone who has ever read the Harry Potter series has desperately wanted to try butterbeer. I mean just look at that name, it <em>looks</em> delicious. And it is. This butterbeer punch is the best drink for the winter &#8211; it will keep you warm and cozy and will take you to a galaxy far, far away.. Oops, sorry, wrong franchise.. But you know what I mean. So, pull out your old Harry Potter books (or movies, whatever floats your boat) to read while you sip on your very own butterbeer. Christmas cocktails have never been this magical!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Boozy Hot Chocolate</h2>



<p>What could we possibly say about hot chocolate that you don’t already know? It is the single greatest drink to exist in the whole wide world, and anyone who disagrees is obviously wrong. There is nothing that can make you feel as instantly at home as a warm cup of hot chocolate. It is almost impossible to make hot chocolate better than it already is. <em>Almost</em>. Because let me present to you <em>Boozy Hot Chocolate.</em> It’s all the goodness of a warm cup of hot chocolate with the kick of your favorite liquor. One of the best Christmas drinks out there!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gingerbread and Espresso Martini</h2>



<p>While we have no way of confirming this, we are convinced that this is what James Bond would drink to get into the Christmas spirit. You can combine the fun, festive flavor of gingerbread with the sophistication of an espresso martini. If you feel like getting a bit dressed up and fancy for Christmas, this is of the Christmas cocktails that will go perfectly with that vibe. But the only requirement is this- a martini glass. How will you feel fancy otherwise?</p>
