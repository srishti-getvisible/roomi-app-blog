And most of the western fringes of the city border the Everglades, a tropical marshland covering most of the southern portion of Florida. Due to this, alligators that live in the marshes have ventured into Miami communities and onto major highways. Whether that&#8217;s fascinating, or terrifying, you decide!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability &amp; Cycling </h3>



<p>Although Miami is a dangerous city for pedestrians, owing to the number of cars in the city, bicycling is a fairly considerable option for transit. In 2010, Miami was ranked the 44th-most bike-friendly city in the US according to&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bicycling magazine.</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Traffic</h3>



<p>The fact is, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article67616167.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Miami traffic is the worst</a>! The Dutch navigation and mapping company <a href="https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TomTom</a>, in its annual report compiled from 14 trillion GPS reports, declared Miami the seventh-most congested city in the United States. So stay prepared with <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/traffic/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waze</a> when you hit that road.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re still daring enough to take a <a href="https://www.miamiandbeaches.com/plan-your-trip/transportation/taxis-cab-services" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cab in Miami</a>, here&#8217;s a breakdown of the average rates. The good news is, most taxi drivers run a meter, displaying the fare you are expected to pay.</p>



<p>The rate in Miami starts at $2.95 for the first 1/6 mile and $.85 for each additional 1/6 mile until 1 mile then $.40 for each 1/6 mile after that.</p>



<p>Waiting time is $.40 per minute (or $24.00 per hour). You’ll also be responsible for any tolls during your trip. Additionally, tipping is optional but customary (and expected for good service which is usually 15 to 20 percent).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public transportation</h3>



<p>With Florida&#8217;s highest transit ridership on a daily basis, the public transportation is operated by <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.miamidade.gov/transit/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miami-Dade Transit</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.tri-rail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SFRTA</a>. It also includes commuter rail (Tri-Rail), heavy-rail rapid transit (Metrorail), an elevated people mover (Metromover), and buses (Metrobus).</p>
