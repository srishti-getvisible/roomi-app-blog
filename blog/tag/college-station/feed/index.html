<p>You can probably guess by its name that College Station is a student hub. In fact, it got its name because of the Texas A&amp;M University’s location along the railroad. This one’s a college town if there ever was one. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a great city to live in for non-students. With an affordable cost of living, great public schools, and an amazing vibe, this city is great for students and families alike! Yes, the typical humid Texan summers can be hard to get used to, but the winters are really pleasant and wonderful!</p>



<p>While the average rent in College Station is a bit higher than the national average, trust us, it’s totally worth every penny. And besides, Roomi will always be there to help you find cheap rooms for rent in College Station. The only thing you need to worry about is figuring out when you want to move! So, with that, let’s take a look at some of the top neighborhoods in the city.</p>
