<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Santa Barbara</h2>



<p>With a colorful past, as vibrant as its geographical climate, Santa Barbara has been inhabited for over 13000 years. First colonized by native Americans, and then taken over by Spanish explorers (who gave the land its current name of the Mission of Saint Barbara,) it was destroyed by a tsunami and earthquake in the 1800s.</p>



<p>Rebuilt in the late 1800s, the Presidio of Santa Barbara survives to this day. After the Spanish reign ended, and a brief Mexican occupancy, the land was won over by the Americans.</p>



<p>During the Gold rush years of California, the town became a haven for bandits, gamblers, turning it into a dangerous and lawless area.</p>



<p>After the war though, the town had the world&#8217;s largest movie studio during the era of silent film &#8211; Flying A Studios, a division of the American Film Manufacturing Company.</p>
