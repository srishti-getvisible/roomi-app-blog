<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Laundry Room Etiquette 101</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cleanliness</h3>



<p>Keep the laundry room tidy, especially when it’s a shared laundry in an apartment. When there are spills, you clean it up and clean out the lint trap, change it after every use and throw away drying sheets and empty detergent wraps. There’s potential for a mess when sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment but can be kept to a bare minimum with intentional efforts like cleaning thoroughly after use. If not done properly, it can cause slipping hazards and in the case of spilling bleach, it can ruin someone’s clothes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Time</h3>



<p>Maximize your time so you don’t waste other’s time. Don’t monopolize the machines. Please don’t leave your dirty clothes sitting in the washer or dryer while someone else is waiting for a machine in a shared laundry in an apartment. Time your laundry, you surely do not want someone else removing your clothes and placing them on the machine or your clothes getting dirty by being tossed aside or collecting mold from being left in the washer for too long.</p>

	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reservation</h3>



<p>You can’t reserve a machine in a shared laundry in an apartment when you are not ready. Being busy is not an excuse for reserving a dryer if you are not actively using a machine especially when you are sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preparation</h3>



<p>Sorting out your clothes for laundry saves time. treat stains in advance this helps to maximize your time so you don’t leave others waiting for a machine. You can get a <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/laundry-detergent-bag.html">different bag for your detergents</a>, softeners, and dryer sheets for easy access.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Respect</h3>



<p>Respect everyone’s space and belongings, ask to be sure if someone is using a machine so you don’t cause an awkward situation also do not monopolize the machines. Use a timer to ensure you get your clothes out on time so you don’t keep your neighbor waiting. This is very essential in a shared laundry in an apartment. This is to avoid being on bad terms with your neighbor. Don’t use someone else’s hamper without permission even if you are sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment and if you know you’d be late in getting your clothes, write a note and leave your laundry basket/hamper by the machine so the next person can help you place them neatly.</p>

								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Patience</h3>



<p>Try to be patient when you notice that a washer or dryer has completed its cycle and the owner is not yet there to pack their clothes, never move anyone’s stuff if you can help it. You don’t want to have issues with someone’s personal belongings. They’ll be back soon. If they don’t return in time and you absolutely have to use a machine, it’s a good rule of laundry room etiquette to wait at least 10 to 20 minutes to see if the owner of the clothes is coming back for their laundry. After the time elapsed and their basket is present, gently place the laundry inside of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you’re a young professional, time management is probably not your strong suit. This means that taking the time out for your hobbies might seem a little insane. After all, most of your energy goes into work and rising up that corporate ladder. You spend so much time multi-tasking at work that once you come back home, the only thing that you really have the patience to do is scrolling mindlessly through Netflix while you eat takeout. But continuing like this can lead to a burn-out that is not going to help anyone.</p>



<p>This is why you need to take the time out for your hobbies. I know, the word itself sounds a bit childish. In fact, “What are your hobbies?” is the third question everyone asks a 5-year-old they just met. But it’s not just for kids. Adults need it too, especially young professionals- <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/02/3-science-backed-reasons-having-a-hobby-will-help-your-career.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">science also says so!</a> It helps reduce stress, it improves your mental and physical well-being, and let’s be honest- who doesn’t want to do the things they love?</p>



<p>If you can’t figure out how to make time for your hobbies, then don’t worry! That’s what we’re here for. If you follow our advice, you will be able to find time in your schedule to completely relax and just do the thing that you love doing! Plus, you get better at time management! Hurray!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip#1: Find out where the leak is</h2>



<p>Young professionals are bad at time management. Of course, generalizing is a bad thing, but I feel like this is true for 99% of youngsters. You either spend too much time relaxing or not enough. You’re either working 80 hours a week or not working at all. Here is where you need to take charge. Time management is an important skill to have, not just professionally but also for your personal life. Once you figure out where you’re wasting your time doing nothing, you’ve cleared space for your hobbies. I know this is easier said than done, but believe me, once you get through this part, the rest will come easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip#2: Multi-tasking!</h2>



<p>Okay, millennials should actually be kinda good at this! I mean being a young professional in a gig economy should definitely teach you a thing or two about multi-tasking. So, do the same with your hobbies! If your hobby is reading, maybe take your book while you commute to work. If you like to write- that’s something you can do while you’re sitting idle in the office. Now, I’m not suggesting you ignore work for your hobby, but you can definitely squeeze your hobbies in there somewhere. Time management is nothing but multi-tasking!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip#3: Turn off your phone!</h2>



<p>Oops! Didn’t mean to sound like your parents there, but they do kinda have a point. You never realize how much time is wasted by just mindlessly scrolling through your phone. This is the one time that multi-tasking doesn&#8217;t really work. Once you’ve figured out when you have free time in your day, put your phone on Do Not Disturb mode and keep it aside. Concentrate solely on your hobby for this while! Consider this your first lesson in time management!</p>



<p>If you need help staying away from your phone, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.geckoandfly.com/23509/smartphone-addiction-boost-productivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here&#8217;s a list of apps that can help</a>!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip#4: The early bird catches the worm</h2>



<p>If you’re a night owl, this one’s probably not for you, but for the rest of us, early morning is a great time to dedicate to your hobby. You don’t have work yet, the rest of the world is relatively quiet and everything is peaceful. If you manage your time well, you can actually get an hour’s worth of time for your hobbies before you need to get on with your professional life. Having all this free time will make you feel like a time management wizard!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip#5: Prioritize</h2>



<p>You might be one of those people who has multiple hobbies and interests. While that’s a fantastic thing, it might not always suit your schedule very well. Multi-tasking is a great skill to have, but you should also know where to draw the line. Time management means learning how to prioritize based on how hectic your schedule is. Young professionals don’t generally get a lot of free time to begin with, so if you try to squeeze in 3 or 4 hobbies in your schedule, you’ll be even more stressed out. So, prioritize and space them out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">And last but not the least, enjoy!</h2>



<p>The whole point of this exercise is to help you relax and let you do something you love. So, don’t stress too much over it. Enjoy the result of all the great time management that you&#8217;ve been doing. Even if you can only <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.missmalini.com/2018/02/20/10-things-that-can-effectively-happen-in-25-minutes-or-less/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take out 20 minutes during the weekdays for your hobbies</a>, that’s good enough! You’ll be surprised at how much those 20 minutes will change your life for the better! So, sit back, take a deep breath and relax. Everything will be fine. Just let yourself enjoy the time you spend doing what you love!</p>
