<p>Today everything looks significantly different than it did in the age before Covid-19 took over all our lives. And we think it&#8217;s safe to say that we&#8217;re a long from things going back to the way they were anytime soon. This is why most people, property consultants included, have turned completely towards conducting virtual home tours and open houses. Thankfully, technology makes it possible to give potential buyers a realistic walkthrough of a home from a safe distance, and agents are working with sellers to drastically reduce or eliminate physical showings unless they’re absolutely necessary.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to remember that just how Zoom classrooms can only come so close to the real deal. Similarly, when you try to see or show an apartment virtually, there will be certain things that might not be able to communicate. Make note of things in advance, and get back to whoever you&#8217;re speaking with.</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-things-to-do-if-you-cant-make-rent-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>What You Should Do If You Can&#8217;t Pay Your Rent</strong></a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are some things to keep in mind before you show an apartment virtually during the Covid-19 pandemic?</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s some of the most practical advice we have for you, as you show an apartment virtually, or see one!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pre-vetting of the person showing and seeing the apartment</h3>



<p>One of the best ways to ensure that you&#8217;re not wasting your time when you show someone an apartment online is to vet them beforehand. This applies to renters looking to find a new apartment in the middle of the pandemic as well. Before you get on that virtual tour of the apartment you might be calling home soon, do as much research as you can. On the rental company, the person you have been in contact with and literally anything else you can find!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do I show occupied rental units safely during the Covid-19 pandemic?</h2>

<p>Get a professional to help you out! No, we don&#8217;t mean hire an entire staging company to come over. That might not be the safest option. But, there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from getting in touch with a local housing agent to learn what the recent trends have been like around you. For occupied rental units this may include rental hikes, utility practices that may have changed, and what the best way to show an apartment during Covid-19 maybe!</p>



<p>Professional help for occupied rental units could also be in the form of photographers that can help you understand the best ways of capturing your apartment. The goal is to make your occupied rental unit as presentable as you can since everyone looking at your space would be trying to make up for the fact that they&#8217;re not there in person.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Show an apartment during Covid-19 with literally just your phone!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ec36cbf1-5d4e-4df1-bde6-cd9aec126834/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman capturing picture of house elements in an attempt to sell her apartment during covid-19 pandemic"/></figure>



<p>With just how uncertain everything has been over the past year, most people wanting to show an apartment during covid-19 have resorted to just using whatever means are available to them. And for a lot of them, this has been quite rewarding!</p>



<p>You can take your own listing photos, using just your phone. These images can also be used to create a video slideshow in the event that a video walkthrough isn’t feasible.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s how you can best capture your apartment without any professional help!</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Use a tripod to provide a stable platform and reduce camera shake.

Retake any photos with these issues.</li><li>Turn on all the lights and open all blinds or curtains for your photoshoot. Pick a time of day where there’s enough sunlight to illuminate areas around windows while avoiding the long shadows that appear in the early morning or late afternoon.</li><li>Use props to show the scale&nbsp;of unused spaces. For example, get out your deck furniture to demonstrate the size of your patio.</li><li>Take several pictures of each room and get different angles. Your agent can also help select your best shots.</li></ul>
