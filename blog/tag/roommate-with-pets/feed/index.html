<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Not all pets need a lot of space!</h2>



<p>If you live in an apartment or small space, having a pet can seem like a challenge. But it doesn’t have to be! There are many low-maintenance pets for apartments that will thrive in your living environment, even if you don’t have much space to work with.</p>



<p>Cats, dogs, fish, hamsters—these are just a few of the many animals that make great pets for apartments. But when it comes to choosing which pet is right for you, we recommend asking yourself a few key questions. Do I want a pet that takes up a lot of my time? Do I want to clean up after my pet? These questions can help narrow down your choices and find the right fluffy (or scaly) fit for you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Dogs</h2>

<p>Some small dogs are great pets for apartments and small spaces, and would make great apartment dwellers since they&#8217;re usually a lot of fun! When trained well, dogs are generally very friendly and welcoming to anyone that visits their home. While not every dog is a low-maintenance pet or suitable for those living in small spaces of apartments, do your research to find a breed that thrives in this environment. Your pup will provide companionship, affection, and entertainment without the need for a large backyard to run around in! Just make sure you take him/her on regular walks.</p>

<p>Cats can be great pets for apartments or small homes, and they certainly keep your home lively and interesting. Not only will they keep you company when you&#8217;re alone, but cats are easy to care for &#8211; they can be trained to use a litter box, and are great pets for small spaces. Playful and affectionate, kitties are perfect if you live in a quiet home. These low-maintenance pets are super chill and don&#8217;t need a lot of space.</p>

<p>Whether you have a small apartment, a large family, or are just tired of cleaning up after your pets, fish can be the perfect solution. They require little space and very little maintenance, only asking for daily food and weekly water changes. In fact, many apartment dwellers keep fish as their only pet, since they&#8217;ve been known to make you feel relaxed. Plus &#8211; you can find some beautiful varieties and build up a happy, colorful tank!</p>

These lovely creatures &#8211; although they don&#8217;t require much space &#8211; still need plenty of love and attention and are a great way to bring some life into your home.</p>

<p>You know it’s time for a pet when you feel like something is missing from your home. However, with small apartments often come big responsibilities. Many traditional pets are not ideal for small spaces such as apartments or condos &#8211; but that doesn’t mean you can&#8217;t get something fun! Get a hamster! These adorable creatures make great pets because they&#8217;re easy to care for and don&#8217;t take up much room at all. A hamster is a fantastic pet for apartments or small spaces since they are clean and quiet pets, who don’t need a lot of room to run around!</p>

<p>Rabbits can be a wonderful addition to an apartment or small space since they are quiet pets. They are as clean and friendly as other pets, but they have several unique traits that can make them easier for people with limited living spaces to accommodate. They’re (cuddly) low-maintenance pets, can be easily toilet trained, and don’t require a lot of space, making them one of the best apartment-friendly pets!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Things to consider before getting pets for apartments</h2>



<p>Even bringing a low-maintenance pet into your household is a major decision! You need to be fully committed to caring for an animal for the rest of its life. You want to enjoy your pet without having to worry about their health and wellbeing. With that being said, consider these things before adding pets to the family!</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If you are considering getting a pet, you should make sure that your apartment community allows pets. Ask management if there will be any fees or charges imposed on your lease agreement.</li><li>Find out if you or anyone in your home has allergies. You should also make sure that your roommate is comfortable with getting pets for apartments.</li><li>Some animals are social and are happier in pairs. Not having a social partner might make your pet depressed &#8211; and you definitely don&#8217;t want that! Ask the advisor in the pet store if they recommend you buy one or two animals.</li><li>When you decide to get a pet, be sure to think about the future. Think about what you&#8217;d do if you took a vacation or moved to a building that doesn&#8217;t allow animals. It is never good for an animal to be alone for too long without the attention of a loving owner.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you and your furry best friend are looking for an apartment to call home, pet-friendly apartments are what you need to look for! And if you&#8217;re thinking how can people (landlords) be so cold-hearted as to not allow a little furry buddy inside the apartment that they&#8217;re not even going to be living in, well, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/27/why-wont-landlords-allow-renters-to-have-pets-8183016/">they have their reasons</a>. However, thankfully, some landlords have succumbed to loving our four-legged friends and will allow it. But like all good things in life, it doesn&#8217;t come for free, unfortunately. So here&#8217;s everything you need to know about pet-friendly apartments, and the differences between pet fees, pet security deposit, and pet rent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First things first, how do you find pet friendly apartments?</h2>



<p>Say it with us: Renters&#8217; rights!</p>



<p>Read up on <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/archive/assets/pdfs/pets/renting_with_pets/recommended_pet_policies.pdf" class="broken_link">state laws</a> to find out whether pets are allowed for renters to keep wherever you live. Then head on to helpful websites like <a href="https://peoplewithpets.com/">people with pets</a>, or use Roomi&#8217;s awesome pet filter to find rooms and roommates that are okay with pets!</p>



<p>Now once you find pet-friendly apartments to shortlist, let&#8217;s get to know about the pet fees you&#8217;ll need to incur to make sure Floofy pays his/her share of rent (through you of course.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="634" height="951" data-attachment-id="13159" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/pet-fee-cost-of-pet-friendly-apartments/attachment/pet-friendly-apart/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?fit=634%2C951&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="634,951" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pet-friendly-apart" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?fit=634%2C951&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?resize=634%2C951&#038;ssl=1" alt="cat playing with her pet friendly owner " class="wp-image-13159" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?w=634&amp;ssl=1 634w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pet-friendly-apart.jpeg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Okay, so what&#8217;s the damage?</h2>



<p>Before diving deep into the costs, make sure it&#8217;s all there <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-apartment-features-check-signing-lease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the lease</a> so you don&#8217;t end up paying more pet fees than you should.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pet deposit</h3>



<p>Just like you pay a security deposit when you rent an apartment, when you rent pet friendly apartments, the landlord might want you to pay a pet security deposit along with pet fees (more on that below). Of course, this is to make sure sparky keeps his job and continues to pay rent. And also, because in the case of any major destruction (that any pet will surely cause) can be covered with that money.</p>



<p>Fair enough, right?</p>



<p>And the good thing is, just like regular security deposit, if you and your four legged roommate are well trained and leave the apartment in good condition when you move, you&#8217;ll get this money back.</p>



<p>Varied by location, the average pet deposit ranges between 40% and 85% of the rent, as per <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/dogs/living-with-your-dog/pet-friendly-housing-study/">Petfinder</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pet rent</h3>



<p>Now this is a kind of pet fees that is not refundable. Just like you pay a monthly rent for your own stay, you&#8217;ve got to pay pet rent, that can range from $ 10 &#8211; 60. However, the pet rent depends on factors such as the pet’s size, whether the property is urban or suburban, and even past personal experiences of the landlord with pets.</p>



<p>But make sure you check state laws and have this on the lease before you sign and agree to the pet rent demanded by your landlord. Good experiences = low rent, and vice versa!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="634" height="951" data-attachment-id="13161" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/pet-fee-cost-of-pet-friendly-apartments/attachment/doggo/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?fit=634%2C951&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="634,951" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="doggo" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?fit=634%2C951&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?resize=634%2C951&#038;ssl=1" alt="a pet sitting in a pet friendly apartment " class="wp-image-13161" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?w=634&amp;ssl=1 634w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/doggo.jpeg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So what are pet fees?</h3>



<p>While pet rent and pet deposit do account for types of pet fees in pet friendly apartments, pet fees is an additional cost that landlords charge to allow a pet to pee in their property. (oops, we mean, be.)</p>



<p>It can range from $200-500, but again, make sure to check the laws of the area you live in, and also make sure it&#8217;s on the lease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do I have to pay pet fees for a service animal?</h2>



<p>As <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/fair-housing-act-and-assistance-animals" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Humane Society</a> mentions:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Service and assistance animals are not technically pets and owners do not have to pay pet fees. The landlord, however, can charge a pet security deposit and may still seek money from the tenant if there is any damage caused by the animal to the home.</p></blockquote>



<p>Moreover, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/renters-rights-can-landlord-refuse-service-animal/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">landlords do not have the right to refuse service or assistance animals</a> under any circumstance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Under the FHA, a disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment which significantly limits a person’s major life activities. Even if a lease says &#8220;no pets&#8221; or restricts pets, landlords are required to make what is called a “reasonable accommodation” to allow pets who serve as assistance animals, which includes animals who provide emotional support.</p></blockquote>



<p>So there you have it. May you and your furry friend live happily ever after in your new apartment!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best cat breeds for apartments</h2>



<p>You might be wondering, what makes a cat breed suitable for the apartment life? Well, not all breeds are the same when it comes to cats. There are many reasons why some breeds are better suited than others. The level of activity, and the space that a cat needs, varies by breed. Some breeds also shed a lot and would be hard to clean after in an apartment. Living in close quarters with humans means that indoor cats should be friendly and tolerant too. That being said, here are some breeds you should consider, and why!</p>

They are also tolerant of humans and don&#8217;t mind sharing space.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Apartment size</h3>



<p>While some breeds are less active and require less space, there should still be enough space for your cat. Make sure that your indoor cat has enough space to walk around and have its space. There should at least be some space for your pet to play around or stretch its legs occasionally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Kitty Litter</h3>



<p>You may not have given this too much thought, but your cat is going to need a litter. Yes, just like you, your furry friend is going to be relieving itself regularly. This can be messy and cause an odor in an enclosed space. You will need to ensure you have space for a kitty litter and ventilation for the smells.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Storage and shelves</h3>



<p>Being the inquisitive animals they are, your cat is going to be exploring its space. While some cat breeds for apartments are less active, they will still occasionally climb about. If you have a lot of open cabinets, fragile decorations or objects, and things that can get knocked over, then caution. You want to hold off on getting yourself a cat, or maybe secure things behind cabinets with doors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Windows</h3>



<p>Your furry friend will appreciate being able to bask in the sun on a cold day. Cats also enjoy looking out of windows and watching the activity outside. Having a window is important for your furry friend&#8217;s well-being and comfort.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting along with a roommate can be challenging at times, even when your personalities do complement each other. Add pets with roommates into the mix and diplomacy can break down fast. Especially in NYC, where owning a pet is harder than usual due to a high cost of living and limited accessibility to things like parks. Part of the problem is that we tend to think of our pets as just that. Ours. Our pet is our responsibility, our love and joy, our source of occasional stress. But if your current roommate or prospective roommate has a pet, then you can work together to own pets with less stress despite the challenges NYC presents.</span></p>
<p><b>Consider The Benefits Of Sharing Pets With Roommates</b></p>
<p><b>Happier, healthier pets: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even cats want a play pal sometimes. If your pet and your roommate&#8217;s pet get along, they won’t be bored when both of you are working. And a decrease in pet boredom correlates to an increase in furniture longevity. That’s just science.</span></p>
<p><b>Balance work life with pet care: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in NYC, chances are you work some crazy hours just to make rent. That can leave your pet home alone for longer than you’d like. If you and your roommate have offset schedules, you can split up pet duties. Then you don’t have to worry while you’re at work that your puppy is developing abandonment issues and tearing up your favorite pajamas in an act of wholesale retribution.</span></p>
<p><b>Save time and money: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pets are totally worth it, but they’re a lot of work, and they’re not cheap. Especially in NYC. You can get more chores done in less time if you split the workload between the two of you and coordinate. You save money by buying common items in bulk whenever possible.</span></p>
<p><b>Pet Care Action Items For You And Your Roommate In NYC</b></p>
<p><b>Balance work schedule with pet workload:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Put both of your work schedules down on paper. For each day, mark who leaves and who gets home first and second. Assign pet care tasks, like putting food in bowls and refilling water. Keep the workload even and make sure your pets are getting maximum social time with you and your roommate.</span></p>
<p><b>Buy bulk: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and your roommate should take a moment and write down every single expense your pet incurs. Then sit down together and circle the commonalities. You can buy those in bulk and split the price. If you both have the same kind of pet, you might be able to get them to agree on the same kind of food. This is easier with less finicky eaters. Like Labrador Retrievers, Mother Nature’s adorable cross between a furry canine and an insatiable vacuum cleaner. If your pets just aren’t having it, there are plenty of other expenses you can split. Wipes. Bags. Brushes. Shampoos. Litter box necessities. Biscuits. Bacon. pH balance chemicals for saltwater fish. Toys. The list goes on.</span></p>
<p><b>Tired pets are well-behaved pets:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alternate walk days and double the frequency your pets get to go outside and stretch their legs. Walking two pets at once is a good solution for smaller animals or well-trained ones. It’s not advisable for larger pets who might confuse being paired up with another animal as some kind of competition. A Husky might think, “oh hey, we’re racing now?” and next thing you know, you’re going for an unscheduled ride.</span></p>
<p><b>Merge pet cleanup with room cleanup: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pets deposit hair, splash water, and some occasionally throw up for no reason whatsoever. Instead of treating pet cleanup like a separate chore, let your powers combine and fuse pet cleanup with regular apartment cleaning.</span></p>
<p><b>Have a pet cleaning station at the door: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite NYC being a concrete jungle, pets have this uncanny ability to find every speck of dirt, every murky puddle, and track it back to the apartment. Put a pet clean up station with shared supplies right at the door to keep your apartment from being zoned by NYC as a landfill.</span></p>
