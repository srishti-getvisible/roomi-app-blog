										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The biggest cause of stress for most of us in New York isn’t the traffic or the neighbors, it&#8217;s rent. The <a href="https://www.rentdata.org/new-york-ny-hud-metro-fmr-area/2024" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Fair Market Rent</a> in NYC for a two-bedroom apartment costs $2,752 monthly, 99% more expensive than in other cities.</p>



<p>And if you ever wanted to take a trip then that NYC apartment can start to feel like a ball and chain. What do you do then? It’s simple, sublet.&nbsp;That’s how you can enjoy your freedom and take time off to see the rest of the world. Here’s everything you need to know on how to sublet in NYC.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at&nbsp;what a sublet is, what it isn’t, and how you can do it&nbsp;in The Big Apple.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-a-sublet">What is a &#8216;Sublet&#8217;?</h2>



<p>A sublet is like a temporary leave of absence. Say you’re going to Europe for a month or two, but surely, you&#8217;re coming back. With so many people looking for a place to stay in New York City, it wouldn’t make a lot of sense to let the apartment sit there all alone without someone to keep it company. And pay your lease while you’re away. That’s why you should sublet an apartment in NYC. Lots of people need a temporary place because they just got to the city and need time to find something more permanent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-sublet-in-nyc-is-not-forever">A Sublet In NYC Is Not Forever</h3>



<p>That’s the difference between a sublet and assigning a lease. If you intend to come back, you need a sublet. If you&#8217;re trying to get out of your lease and you want someone to take it over completely, then you’re assigning it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-find-a-sublet-in-nyc">How to Find a Sublet in NYC</h2>



<p>Okay. The City of Dreams sleeps on a big fluffy bed made out of paperwork, so make sure to check off all the little details. Here’s the basic overview of what to do subletting in NYC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-gather-all-information-needed">#1: Gather all information needed</h3>



<p>It’s gonna feel like a lot, but none of it should be too hard to get.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The sublease length of the apartment in NYC. How long are you going to be out of town?</li>



<li>The name and address of the tenant from whom you’re subletting in NYC. Hopefully, you found them on Roomi because then you can use the chat feature to get all that from them if you don’t have it already.</li>



<li>Why are you subletting? Basically, the reason for your decision to sublet an apartment in NYC. Traveling musician? Visit family? Hula dancing?</li>



<li>Written consent of anyone else who has the primary lease with you, such as a guarantor or cosigner. Your roommate would be in for a surprise if they see another person they don&#8217;t know in the apartment without any kind of warning.</li>



<li>Finally, a copy of your own lease, if you can.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-find-a-subletter">#2: Find a Subletter</h3>



<p>A subletter couldn&#8217;t just be anyone. Ideally, someone you already know and trust is already a good candidate. Asking friends and family if they know anyone looking for a place is also a good way to find a dependable subletter. But the best way is to use a reliable room and roommate finder app, like Roomi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="612" height="408" data-attachment-id="21183" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-sublet-in-nyc/attachment/find-a-subletter/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?fit=612%2C408&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="612,408" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Find a Subletter" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?fit=612%2C408&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?resize=612%2C408&#038;ssl=1" alt="Find a Subletter" class="wp-image-21183" style="width:853px;height:auto" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?w=612&amp;ssl=1 612w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Find-a-Subletter.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></figure>

<p>With Roomi, you can list your room and have potential subletters right away. The app is safe with security and privacy measures like in-app messaging, thorough background checks, and ID verification. This ensures that you&#8217;re talking to a real person behind the account and not a scammer or fraudster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3: Be wary of rental scams!</h3>



<p>Scammers are everywhere but don&#8217;t let them come near your subletting process. Take note of these rental scams and don&#8217;t fall for any misleading links or ghost apartments.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fake rentals or listings: </strong>These are bogus property listings with attractive photos to lure renters and eventually scam them into making deposits, then disappearing right after.</li>



<li><strong>Overseas landlords: </strong>Some landlords say they&#8217;re in a different country so they can&#8217;t meet you in person. They&#8217;ll make you send an advanced payment to secure the apartment or for them to mail the keys to you, but once the money&#8217;s sent, they&#8217;re gone.</li>



<li><strong>Phishing scams: </strong>These are deceptive emails or messages asking people to click on malicious links or provide sensitive information to eventually scam the person.</li>



<li><strong>Identity theft: </strong>Just like phishing scams, identity theft is prevalent online. Scammers use a different person&#8217;s identity to pose as a landlord, providing valid IDs to earn the trust of renters, then once the payment&#8217;s been sent over and it&#8217;s time to get the keys, the property is already occupied or it doesn&#8217;t exist.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4: Check with your landlord</h3>



<p>Next, it’s your landlord’s part that moves the subletting process further. They might have more questions or need additional info. If they do, get it to them as soon as you can. Remember, you have to send a written request with all that jazz to your landlord. Use certified mail, and make sure to ask for a return receipt. Once you send off any extra stuff, the 30-day countdown begins.</p>

<p>Your landlord’s got 30 days to say yes or no. If they don’t get back to you at all, then that counts as a yes. Now, you can have a great sublet experience in NYC!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5: Make a backup plan, just in case!</h3>



<p>Although settling your subletting situation takes a lot of work, it&#8217;s best to have a backup plan just in case. Set aside some extra money if your subletter doesn&#8217;t push through or there&#8217;s any mishap that happens, at least you&#8217;re prepared!</p>



<p>You can also have someone check in with you in case your subletter stops communicating with you, or they can&#8217;t pay a month&#8217;s rent for any reason. Remember, subletting is different than becoming a part of or signing a lease.</p>



<p>Now, it’s New York, so it shouldn’t come as a big shock to find out there are exceptions and special circumstances. Check out the “Tenant’s Rights” document, courtesy of the Attorney General, for more information that’ll make a sublet in NYC way easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time To Sublet!</h2>



<p>In the exciting world of subletting in NYC, the possibilities are endless! With the right information and resources, you can navigate the sublet market with confidence. Just remember to plan everything down to a T, beware of rental scams, have a backup plan, use a reliable room finder, and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>

<p>As it is, spare rooms are frequently left unused, or they become a dumping ground for stuff&nbsp;that has no other place to go. They are usually the smallest room in the house, so it&#8217;s a challenge to find its purpose. However, with a little planning and intelligent placing, you can create a home to be proud of. And no, we&#8217;re not talking about the regular spare room ideas with a guest room or home office. We believe a spare bedroom can be used for a variety of purposes, including practicing a hobby, creating a play area for your children, and even subletting it to create a new source of income.</p>



<p><strong><em>Here are 8 unique spare room ideas to make the most out of your space!</em></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-set-up-a-studio-or-hobby-room">2. Set up a studio or hobby room</h2>



<p>You can transform an empty room into an art studio or hobby area, whether you enjoy sewing, stamp collecting, or playing the guitar. To make the space ready, all it needs is a little paint, some storage containers, and perhaps a work table. You&#8217;ll most&nbsp;likely spruce up the rest of the house as well by shifting all of the craft and hobby clutter to a single spot.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-your-very-own-home-gym">3. Your very own home gym!</h2>



<p>Is your treadmill in the living room becoming a pile-up? To establish a dedicated workout space, move it to an empty room with your other exercise equipment. Position a full-length mirror against one of the walls to help you perfect your technique. You might discover that when your equipment is all ready to go, you&#8217;ll want to get moving more often.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-create-a-mini-library">4. Create a mini library</h2>



<p>Have you ever imagined yourself like Belle from &#8220;Beauty and the Beast,&#8221; whirling around in your own private library surrounded by towering bookshelves? If you don&#8217;t have enough space in your living room for a home library, your spare bedroom will suffice. Arrange shelves along the walls and set aside a place for the most comfortable chair you can find.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-garden-your-space">5. Garden your space</h2>



<p>Among excellent spare room ideas that help our environment is gardening! Gardeners without the space or cash for a greenhouse can grow seedlings in their spare bedroom from the end of winter to the beginning of spring. Purchase readymade shelves or build your own, and be sure to use lights that help plants to flourish.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-walk-in-closet">6. Walk-in closet!</h2>



<p>If your style is a priority, the extra room could double up as a classic dressing room. Consider this: a vanity, shoe and accessory organizers, and a myriad of mirrors. A vintage screen and elaborate lighting finish off this interior to perfection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-play-game-room">7. Play/game room</h2>



<p>If you have children, you might want to consider turning the extra room into a playroom. Arrange their toys to create a large space for them to play and be active.</p>



<p>Consider investing in a wide area rug to make sitting on the floor more comfortable. Make sure there are enough arts and crafts in the room in case of a stormy day. The best part of all? You won&#8217;t find as many toys thrown around your living room, bathroom and garden!</p>



<p>Game rooms are also among the most fantasized spare room ideas for bachelors! You can design a dedicated game room with comfortable chairs and a wide table that can hold huge boards. Set up a console zone with beanbag seats if you&#8217;re a big player. Add a mini-fridge packed with game-night beverages for a luxurious touch, and you&#8217;re good to go!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-brainstorm-area">8. Brainstorm area</h2>



<p>Having a proper space&nbsp;to work out your ideas, whether you&#8217;re a writer or an entrepreneur, is vital. Convert your spare room into an area&nbsp;with whiteboards and plenty of blank wall space where you can plan out your ideas and let your imagination run wild. It doesn&#8217;t have to be an office, but rather a place where you can be yourself!</p>

<p>A spare room does not have to be a waste of space, stacked with boxes and stuff in storage that you&#8217;ll never use. There is a wide range of options for re-purposing the space and transforming it into something both beautiful and functional. From a yoga studio to a library or a play area, the possibilities are endless!</p>
