										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Winters can be really grim for a lot of us. The cold, dark and damp atmosphere can be brutal for your mental health. And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">pandemic</a> sure hasn’t helped. But if the gloominess just doesn’t seem to go away and has seriously started to affect you, you might have Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD generally occurs during winter months when your exposure to sunlight decreases significantly. As a result, many people recommend light therapy for SAD. If you’ve never heard of it before, it might seem a bit strange. You might think to yourself, “how could a lamp cure my SAD?”. But you might be surprised by what other people have to say about it. So, today let’s talk about light therapy and whether it actually works. But before we do that, let’s look a little bit into SAD itself first.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)?</h2>



<p>As Dr. <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_E._Rosenthal" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Norman E. Rosenthal, M.D.</a></em>, a pioneer in SAD research, puts it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Seasonal Affective Disorder is a type of depression that occurs regularly, every autumn and winter, when the days get short and dark, though it may occur at other times as well. The reason it occurs mostly during the winter months is that one of the main causes of the condition is a lack of sunlight. Other situations in which people don’t get enough sunlight include cloudy or rainy periods at other times of year, living in dark places and working for long hours in dark offices. Whenever there is insufficient sunlight, those people who are vulnerable to Seasonal Affective Disorder may develop symptoms.”</p><cite>Norman E. Rosenthal, M.D.</cite></blockquote>

<p>Now that we know what SAD is, let’s see what some of the symptoms are and how light therapy can help with SAD.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the symptoms of SAD?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">According to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/">Mayo Clinic</a>, the following are some of the signs and symptoms of SAD:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Feeling depressed most of the day, nearly every day</li><li>Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed</li><li>Having low energy</li><li>Having problems with sleeping</li><li>Experiencing changes in your appetite or weight</li><li>Feeling sluggish or agitated</li><li>Having difficulty concentrating</li><li>Feeling hopeless, worthless or guilty</li><li>Having frequent thoughts of death or suicide</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Additionally, winter SAD symptoms may also include:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Oversleeping</li><li>Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates</li><li>Weight gain</li><li>Tiredness or low energy</li></ul>



<p>If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, please reach out to a mental health specialist. You can find more resources <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.gov/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Light therapy, the use of a lamp or light box as an artificial source of light, is said to be very helpful in treatment option for SAD.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, what is light therapy exactly and how does a lamp help cure SAD?</h2>



<p>According to .Mayo Clinic, light therapy basically involves the patient being exposed to an artificial light source as a way to mimic natural light. You’re basically supposed to do your work, attend online classes, watch random youtube videos, near a device known as light therapy box. It looks like a lamp, and it’s supposed to help with SAD.</p>



<p>While research on light therapy helping with SAD is inconclusive, it is thought to affect certain brain chemicals that might put you at ease.</p>



<p>So, while light therapy alone will not cure SAD, it can certainly make you feel better. There’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that light therapy does help with SAD.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a good lamp or light box to help with SAD?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Roomi recommended SAD lamp</strong>: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carex-Day-Light-Classic-Bright-Therapy/dp/B00PCN4UVU?keywords=Carex&amp;qid=1573223468&amp;s=hpc&amp;sr=1-3&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=sad-lamps-20&amp;linkId=0156656ac569ccea85ef9a62461fb6bd&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;correlationId=efd655b3-01da-4484-bbe7-e91f99060251" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carex Day-Light Classic Plus Bright Light Therapy Lamp</a></h3>



<p>The Carex Day-light is the best option you have at its price point. It has a surface area of 15.5 by 13.5 inches and generates 10,000 lux. Because of the downward motion of the light, it’s always glare-free. If you want to invest in a good lamp for light therapy to help with SAD, this is the one you should go with.</p>

<p>So light therapy won&#8217;t cure your SAD, it might make you feel better. And sometimes that’s the best one can hope for in times like these. You might find that it eases your symptoms and makes you feel more energized. But remember to give it some time. Things won’t change overnight, but with time you might find that light therapy does help you. But make sure you also talk to a mental health specialist in addition to light therapy. They’ll be able to give you the personalized attention and guidance you need to get better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on everyone across the world. Things no longer are the same as they were a year ago, and all of us found ourselves adjusting, and to different capacities struggling this past year. mental health has been a more important topic than ever, and we can all rightly say, that the conversation needs to keep evolving around the subject.</p>



<p><strong>According to Mental Health America, youth mental health is worsening. 9.7% of youth in the U.S. have severe major depression, compared to 9.2% in last year’s dataset. This rate was highest among youth who identify as more than one race, at 12.4%. Even before COVID-19, the prevalence of mental illness among adults was increasing. In 2017-2018, 19% of adults experienced a mental illness, an increase of 1.5 million people over last year’s dataset.</strong></p>



<p>While it may be that some of us are more vulnerable than others, everyone faces challenges in life that can impact our mental health. After all, just a few months ago, none of us had any idea that all our worlds would be upended by the coronavirus, and that worry, isolation, loneliness, depression, and anxiety would become collective experiences shared by literally everyone.</p>



<p>Before we get into how we can preserve our mental health, let&#8217;s get into the details of what Mental Health Awareness Month is.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can you look after your mental health and keep anxiety at bay?</h2>



<p>Here is some of the most tried and tested practical advice for anxiety that we have for you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Talk to someone who will listen.</h3>



<p>Talking about your feelings can help you stay in good mental health and deal with times when you feel troubled.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Take a walk, and keep yourself active.</h3>



<p>Regular exercise can boost your self-esteem and can help you concentrate, sleep, and feel better. It can also help you keep your anxiety in check. Exercise keeps the brain and your other vital organs healthy and is also a significant benefit towards improving your mental health. A great form of exercise is practicing yoga, straight from the comfort of your home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Take care of your diet, and add probiotics to it!</h3>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641835/#:~:text=Increasing%20evidence%20has%20associated%20gut,are%20prevalent%20in%20society%20today.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy gut</a> is proven to have great effects on people struggling with their mental health.</p>



<p>Your brain needs a mix of nutrients in order to stay healthy and function well, just like the other organs in your body. A diet that’s good for your physical health is also good for your mental health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Keep your alcohol consumption in check.</h3>



<p>Those of us that do, consume alcohol at every celebration, every sorrow. Some people drink to deal with fear or loneliness, but the effect is only temporary.</p>



<p>Difficult feelings only get worse if you try to manage them through alcohol. You&#8217;ll only end up feeling worse after the temporary numbness wears off. So keeping your alcohol consumption in check can be extremely beneficial.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don&#8217;t allow yourself to fall out of touch</h3>



<p>There’s nothing better than catching up with someone face to face, but that’s not always possible. You can also give them a call, drop them a note, or chat to them online instead. Keep the lines of communication open: it’s good for you!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Ask for help.</h3>



<p>Our world is evolving at a speed much higher than our minds, and people today are suffering with depression and anxiety more than ever before.</p>



<p>If things are getting too much for you and you feel you can’t cope, ask for help. Your family or friends may be able to offer practical help or a listening ear.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Take a break and so something you&#8217;re good at.</h3>



<p>A major cause for depression and anxiety can be commotion that we aren&#8217;t able to get away from. A change of scene or a change of pace is good for your mental health. It could be anything from a 5-minute break to a month-long pause. Take the time that you need, and maybe indulge in something you know you&#8217;re good at!</p>



<p>Enjoying yourself can help beat stress. Doing an activity you enjoy probably means you’re good at it, and achieving something boosts your self-esteem</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Accept yourself, as well as others around you.</h3>



<p>We’re all different. It’s much healthier to accept that you’re unique than to wish you were more like someone else. Feeling good about yourself boosts your confidence to learn new skills, and is a wonderful way to beat anxiety. Give yourself the time to visit new places and make new friends. Good self-esteem helps you cope when life takes a difficult turn. Similarly, caring for others is just as important. Bringing yourself close to people who you call friends can keep your spirits up, and form a supportive bond for everyone involved!</p>

<p>In many ways, New York city roommates become family. You celebrate good times together – promotions, engagements and personal goals. You also see each other through the bad times &#8211; work stress, family drama and the emotional affair that is a break up. We all know what goes in the basic helping-a-roommate-through-a-break up starter pack. There&#8217;s ice cream, time on the couch, and movie marathons.</p>



<p><em>Also see: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/7-binge-worthy-netflix-shows-roomi/2218/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Binge-worthy Netflix Shows</a></em></p>



<p>What comes next though? Do you just listen or must you offer relationship advice? What if you’ve never been in a relationship as serious as the one your roommate was in? What is the right thing to say? What if you really suck at giving relationship advice? Don’t worry, even if your go-to relationship advice is “don’t do it,” it doesn’t make you a bad friend/roommate.</p>



<p>To help you, we’ve put together a few key pointers that you can borrow:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Remind them that the end of a relationship is not a failure</strong></h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:91%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/otK5w3XJaGJTa" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/otK5w3XJaGJTa/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Often being in a relationship is seen as a ‘win’ and having one break, especially when you’re older is treated as a failure. Remind your roomi that in the business of love, there is no winning or losing. It’s just about cherishing the good times, accepting the learning and moving on when the relationship has run its course. Both parties in a relationship deserve to find ‘their’ person and letting go is an important step to getting there.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Tell it like it is</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:57%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/InniOVGZEestq" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/InniOVGZEestq/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>When we’re not quite sure what to say, we often fall to using cookie cutter responses like “How dare he/she/they do this to you!” or “Look on the bright side, now you can date anyone you want!” The only problem with these responses is that they don’t actually help. Avoid pitying your friend and beware of pulling out the silver lining too early. Find a middle ground where you acknowledge and validate the intense suckiness that is a break up and gently have your pal look toward a brighter future. Something along the lines of “I’m so sorry you’re feeling awful right now, but you will get through it and find something amazing in your future.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Ask what they need rather than assuming what they want</strong></h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/t7NqkPey14axG" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/t7NqkPey14axG/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Every relationship is different, every person is different and every break up is also different. What works for you after a break up may not necessarily work for your friend so the best thing to do is ask your roommate what you can do to help. They may not want to do anything immediately but leave the offer open-ended so they can come to you when they’re ready.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Keep an eye on them</strong></h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

	</div>
	


<p>Some people throw themselves into their work after a break up and others like to wallow. There’s no right or wrong way to do it, but in this post break up phase, healthy food often takes a backseat, hygiene and exercise are also frequently skipped. The advantage of being New York City roommates in this situation is that you can keep a close eye on your friend. Without pressuring your roommate into doing too much, make sure they eat some fruit along with their junk food binge or take breaks from work. Thanks to endorphins, exercise helps people feel better. But if your roomi wants to skip the gym, try to take them for a walk instead or sit on the balcony for some connection with the outdoors. In short, make sure they function so it’s easier for them to get through this.</p>

<p>Everyone reacts differently to emotional situations and a break up is as personal as it can get. So, if you feel like there is no nugget of relationship advice that you can offer. Don’t.&nbsp; Just let them know that you’re there in case they need you.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Sometimes we need someone to simply be there. Not to fix anything or do anything in particular but just to let us feel we are supported and cared about.</em></p><cite><em>Anonymous</em></cite></blockquote>
