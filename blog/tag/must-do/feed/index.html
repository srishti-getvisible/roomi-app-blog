<p>It&#8217;s a Saturday and you and your roommates are bored out of your wits. There&#8217;s nothing that excites any of you on Netflix, and the day just <em>calls</em> for some outdoors.</p>



<p>Guess what? Only a short ride subway away from the most New York City neighborhoods, Long Island City has enough and more in store for all your exploratory needs. So head out for a hearty brunch and a stroll, or explore hidden gems to your must-experience list for 2021!</p>



<p>Historically called Dutch Kills, Long Island City is experiencing quite the <a href="https://untappedcities.com/2013/08/01/hunters-point-long-island-city-the-modern-corridor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dramatic renewal process</a> — which includes rezoning as well. Moreover, Long Island City is known for its centralized location and its manufacturing and industrial influences. Alot of it&#8217;s glory comes from it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_transportation_in_New_York_City" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">served as an integral point between Queen&#8217;s road networks in the 19th century. This was meant for the construction of the Queensboro Bridge connecting Manhattan</a>.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything you and your roommates needs to satiate your explorers&#8217; curiosity and add to your list of must-do things in Long Island City!</p>

<p>Casa Enrique is known to keep things super simple with their Mexican cuisine. Especially if you&#8217;re looking to avoid any frills or extras that&#8217;ll take your attention away from the beauty of traditional home-cooked meals, straight from Chiapas, Mexico.</p>



<p>Chef Cosme Aquilar&#8217;s menu consists of classics like guacamole, ceviche, and a variety of enchiladas and tacos. But it&#8217;s the fresh and seasonal ingredients that really pack a punch. Some even argue this is the best Mexican food you&#8217;re going to find in Long Island. If that doesn&#8217;t make your list of &#8216;must-do things with your roommates,&#8217; what does?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s just call MoMA PS1 the hip young sister of the world-renowned MoMA in midtown Manhattan, which identifies as more of an &#8220;exhibition space,&#8221; as opposed to an &#8220;institution of collections.&#8221;</p>



<p>MoMA PS1 showcases experimental and contemporary art, usually utilizing interactive elements like sound, video, light, and more. VW Sunday Sessions allow visitors to experience and participate in live art. Also, throughout the summer its popular Warm Up Series hosts live electronic music concerts, taking place within some type of artistic installation.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll find a few Tamashii Ramen locations in Queens. And you shouldn&#8217;t miss out on this one if you&#8217;re in Long Island. Additionally, The expansive menu that Tamashii boasts of, consists of some rich broths made fresh daily. Including chicken, five different vegetables, simmered for a whole 14 hours!</p>



<p>A whole colony of seafood and medicinal herbs are added to balance the flavor. And they offer nutritional elements!  Above all, their popular bowls include the Miso Ramen (soybean-flavored ramen)! Along with, the Shio Ramen (made with mineral salt), and Shoyu Ramen (made with soy sauce). In conclusion if you&#8217;re the kind that doesn&#8217;t shy away from spice, try the Tan-Tan Men! It&#8217;s esssentially a hot sesame flavored ramen.</p>
