Beyond this, it is a good sport and outdoor activity that can help you stay fit. Whether you&#8217;re just relocating or you&#8217;re staying here permanently, riding bikes in San Francisco is one of the best things you can do around the area.</p>

<p>Relatively easy. There are bike lanes all around the city. However, sometimes you’ll still find the lanes congested with Ubers and Lyfts &#8211; especially in areas where there is no separation of lanes. When this happens, consider other users of the road &#8211; such as a car that needs to park or turn &#8211; to stay safe. Remember that a bike lane that is not separated belongs to the community.</p>



<p>You may need to learn the basic bicycle thoroughfares in San Francisco. You can easily find them by following the street signs or <a href="http://SFMTA.com/BikeMap">a map like this</a>. Using the thoroughfare helps you avoid areas that are commonly congested for bikers.</p>

<p>Biking in San Francisco is generally safe. When you opt for a bicycle over a car, you’re actually choosing a statistically safer means of transport, with statistics showing that there are typically more car accidents than bike accidents yearly. Of the bike accidents that occur, most just involve the bicycle itself. Sometimes, the rider hits a pothole. Other times, they slip on a wet surface or get caught in a Muni track and lose control. In all these cases, the accidents are rarely fatal.</p>



<p>Practice caution and extra care while biking in San Francisco to keep yourself and others around you safe. For example, when biking in San Francisco on a wet day, you must watch out for visibility, and for slippery tires that can put you in danger. Make your riding even safer by wearing protective gear like a helmet (a legal requirement for under 18s), knee and elbow pads, etc.</p>

<p>Biking in San Francisco is something you can do anytime &#8211; whatever the weather. Of course, many prefer a clear day and mild weather to maximize comfort in the saddle. Try biking around in the dry season provided it is not too hot. When things heat up, drink plenty of water!</p>



<p>Comparatively, biking in San Francisco is considerably more difficult and dangerous when there is rain. It can become hard to stop, hard to see, and hard to maintain your balance. Consider leaving your bike at home and finding an alternative means of transport until the weather improves.</p>

<p>The same road signs apply to both cars and bikes. If there’s a car at the stop sign already, by all means, stop too. If there isn’t, you can follow the suggestions of Chris Roberts, a rider in San Francisco. He said, “As a rule of thumb, treat stop signs as yields, and red lights as stop signs.”</p>



<p>What this means is that if there is a car coming, yield to them by waving at them, and acknowledging them. This way, they know you’re aware of their presence (and they also become more aware of yours). If it is a pedestrian already on the cross walk, you may want to stop. However, if you can’t afford to stop abruptly, ensure you cut behind them. This way, even if your bicycle startles them, their panic won&#8217;t let you make a mistake and hit them.</p>

<p>You absolutely do. Especially in months like November, December and January when it usually gets darker earlier, biking without lights can be dangerous. If you ever find yourself riding out late without a light, exercise total caution and use major bike thoroughfares to get home safe and sound.</p>



<p>It helps to prepare for dark, rainy days by installing a bike light. White lights should go to the front of your bike while a red light should illuminate your rear end. Switching the lights can confuse motorists and other cyclists and could lead to accidents.</p>

<p>The possibility exists but you can reduce the chances of losing your bike to theft. If biking in San Francisco is on your to-do list, begin by registering your bike with the city. This is free.&nbsp;Even if someone makes off with it, the chances are high that you&#8217;ll get it back</p>



<p>You can also buy a U-lock and lock the wheels and bicycle frame to any bicycle rack or street-sign pole which are common around San Francisco. Some riders even go as far as using a special cable lock to safeguard their seats to the frame. In any case, don’t forget to ensure your bicycle against theft, too.</p>

<p>Cycling may be your eco-friendly choice for transportation, but storing them can be quite challenging. Not sure how you can store a bike in an apartment? Here’s what you need to know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Can You Store a Bike in an Apartment?</h2>



<p>Apart from being an eco-friendly way to get around the city, cycling every day can help you get some fresh air and is a <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits#:~:text=Regular%20cycling%20stimulates%20and%20improves,and%20reduces%20blood%20fat%20levels.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">good way to exercise</a>. However, storing your bike can be difficult, especially if you live in a small apartment. Storing your bike outside is not an ideal solution, even if your building has dedicated areas for bicycles. Keeping your bicycle outside exposes it to weather elements that reduce the longevity of your precious ride.</p>



<p>So, what can you do when you have a small apartment and like to cycle regularly? Well, you have to get creative with how you store your bike in your apartment. From buying bike racks for small apartments, to hanging your bike on your wall, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/iFFas72-dTY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remember Me</a> style, there’s a lot you can do with them! We’ve curated a list of creative, yet practical ways you can store a bike in an apartment to help you get started.</p>

<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="HOW TO STORE BIKES IN SMALL SPACES" width="1250" height="703" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uPffI-IdN9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Classic Option: Hang it on the Wall</h2>



<p>The easiest way to store your bicycle in a small apartment without sacrificing your storage or floor place is to hang it on the wall. To mount your bike on a wall you can use simple hooks, or those that are designed for heavier bikes.</p>



<p>Some bike racks are designed for small apartments and allow you to hang up your bike to get it off the floor. Such bike racks help you hang your bike vertically, making it look unique and artistic, rather than a nifty way to save some space.</p>



<p>Mounting the bike on your wall can give your apartment a rustic feel, or you can hang coordinated paintings around it to make it feel like a part of the décor!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Use Your Storage</h2>



<p>If you do not mind sacrificing some storage space, then keeping your bicycle stashed away in your storage cupboard will do the trick. Storing your bicycle away in your storage cupboard frees up your space, without ruining the aesthetics of your apartment. If you’re planning on ditching your cycle <a href="https://www.welovecycling.com/wide/2019/11/01/how-to-store-the-bike-away-for-the-winter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the season</a>, this is the ideal way to store your cycle for the upcoming months.</p>



<p>Tuck your bike behind your coat to ensure that it is well out of sight. Placing it flush along the wall of your cupboard ensures it does not take up too much space. There is no special equipment needed for this method, and it is usually fairly easy to take your bike out when you think it is time to ride it again.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hiding in Plain Sight: Make it a Part of Your Décor!</h2>



<p>Apart from using bike wall mounts, you can also include your bike in any room as a part of the décor. For this, you can either add bike racks which can hold multiple bikes, or simply arrange it in any space to make it look more filled out. Coordinate the colors in the room to match your bike and make it seem cohesive. Now, no one will be able to tell that it wasn’t meant to be there in the first place!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Peek-a-boo: Tuck it Behind Furniture</h2>



<p>Have a long sofa or a couch that takes up a lot of space? Well, if it is big enough you can simply tuck your bike behind the furniture to store it there. It is a simple and convenient way to store a bike in an apartment at no extra cost. If you don’t think bike racks for your small apartment are worth the investment, hiding it behind furniture may be the best choice for you. Your guests wouldn’t spot it, and you won’t have to worry about arranging extra space for your bike.</p>



<p>If your apartment has a laundry room, you can also tuck your bike between your washer and dryer to keep it out of the way. This is an age old, tried and tested method, that is inexpensive but effective.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Bike Under the Stairs: Create a Nook for It</h2>



<p>If you love to bike and do it frequently enough, you will have some equipment to go along with it as well. Why not opt for a bike dock in your apartment? Bike docks are user-friendly and easy to install below your stairs. With these docks, you can create a nook for your bike and store your gear neatly in one place. For those who have <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cycling-accessories/">a lot of biking equipment</a> which cannot be hidden away easily, getting a dock is a great choice. If you are renting your apartment, ensure that you check in with your landlord, or your lease to ensure that you can store your bike below your stairs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Outside Your Home: Store It in Your Balcony or Porch</h2>



<p>If you have a balcony or a porch, you can easily store your bike there. Although you may need to check with your landlord if you’re renting; keeping your bike right outside your home ensures that it is safe and out of the way. It is easy to take your bike in and out when it is in your balcony, and ensures that you do not have to sacrifice any storage space!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the best offerings the northeast metros have is their variety of transportation options. Using public transportation or driving&nbsp;through hour-long traffic aren’t your preferred methods of getting around? Then biking through the capital city is another great option. For roommates in Washington D.C., who are already battling rising rent costs, using programs like <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Capital Bikeshare</a> or investing in your own two wheels can be both cost-effective and a great way to experience the city. But wait before you hop on and ride off into the sunset. First, familiarize yourself with the biking laws for when you find roommates in Washington D.C. who are like minded. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s a brief list of biking laws for roommates in Washington D.C.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stopping at lights</h3>



<p>Many D.C. cyclists <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/4ayvsr/anyone_willing_to_speak_about_biking_in_dc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">tend to agree</a> that it’s OK to bike through red lights. Only as long as they aren’t interfering with traffic or doing something that could cause an accident or harm others. Though it’s a common occurrence, it’s actually illegal and could land you in the slammer should something go awry. (You don’t want to be <em>those </em>roommates in Washington D.C.)&nbsp;However, a proposal that would allow cyclists to simply yield at red lights is currently under review. And it “would apply to quiet residential areas where under current law cyclists are required to stop even when there’s no one around,” according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2015/12/08/d-c-considering-letting-bicyclists-roll-through-stop-signs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">The Washington Post</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The law would not allow any behavior that threatens the safety of others,” says Tamara Evans, advocacy director for the Washington Area Bicyclist Association. “Stop as yield would apply where no one else currently has the right of way. It would help divert bicyclists from more dangerous streets to safer streets that they might currently avoid because those streets often have stop signs at every block.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Evans says that the proposal, which Council Member Mary Cheh introduced through The Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety Act, might also encourage the Metropolitan Police Department to concentrate on enforcing traffic laws that would be more likely to cause injury or death. Cyclists throughout the city, many who don’t follow the standing law regardless, support the proposed bill. So when you find roommates in Washington D.C. who are cyclists, make sure you tell them that! </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Under the law, cyclists would be required to stop at a red light, but if no traffic was coming, could then proceed through the intersection with caution,” Evans says. “The law distinguishes between red lights and stop signs.”</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What you should know about riding two abreast with roommates in Washington D.C.</h3>



<p>When the weather is nice and you’re looking for something to do, taking a bike ride with roommates in Washington D.C. is a great outdoor activity. Though riding two abreast (when two cyclists ride side-by-side) is legal, it’s more common to see people biking single file. But because bicyclists can use the full lane they’re in, riding two abreast occupies less of the road, according to Evans.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“This is a contentious subject out of the city on two-lane roads, where it is difficult and sometimes dangerous (or illegal) for drivers to pass,” says Evans. “There is an infraction for impeding the flow of traffic by riding two abreast, as we mention in the pocket guide. So it is somewhat situational depending on how many lanes of traffic there are.”</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stay informed about required bicycle parking</h3>



<p>New to biking and worried about where you would store your own? Fortunately, this is no longer a problem for apartment residents and roommates in Washington D.C. Especially for those who don’t want the hassle of lugging a bike upstairs and finding room for it in their home.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“All new and existing buildings in the District now require bicycle parking,” says Evans. “Locations and types of bicycle parking must be shown in building site plans and be approved by the District Department of Transportation during the development review process. There are two sets of regulations governing bike parking in D.C. Code: Title 11 (zoning) shows number of spaces related to size of development and Title 18 (traffic) governs residential specifications, rack placement, and abandoned bikes, where bikes may legally park.”</p></blockquote>



<p>For a full list of D.C. bike laws, WABA’s pocket guide is available <a href="http://www.waba.org/resources/bikelaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use capital bikeshare</h3>



<p>If buying a new bike isn’t in <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/tips-on-how-to-save-money-for-everyone/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">your budge</a>t, Capital Bikeshare is the next best option. The program offers numerous passes allowing roommates in Washington D.C. to rent bikes to commute to their destination. As a member of the program, you can use a bike for a free 30-minute ride. An additional fee will be added to your bill if you go over the first 30 minutes. But every new bike you take offers another free 30-minute trip. So essentially, customers can bike for 30 minutes. Then park the bike in a Capital Bikeshare station (if one is available.) Take out a new bike and ride for 30 minutes again. Considering the inexpensive membership cost, many roommates in Washington D.C. enjoy the convenience of the program.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Biking is my primary mode of transportation. Plus, you can get practically anywhere in D.C. in 30 minutes,” says Erin Gifford, a marketing professional. “The metro is terrible, buses are OK, and walking is great but slow. My company has nine locations throughout the D.C. area, so it’s nice to be able to move about the city easily and quickly on a bike.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Though Gifford notes that it’s frustrating when a bike isn’t available, Capital Bikeshare’s app and the station kiosks notify its members of availability at other stations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Take advice from the pros</h3>



<p>As a cyclist, you really can’t win; cars loathe driving around you, and pedestrians will curse the day you accidentally side-swipe them on the crosswalk. Despite the reputation cyclists have with both parties, however, there are things you can do to avoid confrontation and prevent potential accidents. So when you find roommates in Washington D.C., here&#8217;s something to discuss before you venture out. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“My number one rule is to be predictable,” Mike Abrams, a D.C. paralegal says. “If the cars, pedestrians and other cyclists are expecting you to do what you do, you’ll probably be fine.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Abrams advises practicing safety. Even as an experienced biker! That means going the correct way on one-way streets or using lights and neon vests when biking through the dark. Likewise, cyclists should exercise caution on sidewalks around pedestrians. And they should mind the actions of those around them. If, say, a driver is texting or a passenger of a cab is exiting the car.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“My biggest pet peeve when driving around cyclists is when they pass on the right at intersections,” says Abrams. “The most dangerous interaction between cars and bikes is when the car passes the bike. The cyclist passing the car at the intersection just forces the car to have to pass the bike repeatedly, which is dangerous.“It’s not worth the extra 20 feet by moving to the front of the intersection. When I ride, I try never to force someone to pass me more than once. I act like a car and stay in the middle of the lane at lights. Not saying the cyclist should move to the back of the line at an intersection. But forcing unnecessary extra passes is just stupid, in my opinion.”</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Document everything</h3>



<p>Gifford agrees with the above notion. And while biking is her main mode of transportation now, she admits that cyclists and drivers attempting to pass each other at lights is a common problem. Of course, drivers and pedestrians have their own faults as well.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Pedestrians cross the street whenever they want and jaywalk, forcing me to slam on my brakes so I don’t end up in prison,” Gifford says. “Drivers unaware get way too close, drive in the bike lanes and don’t always look for cyclists. Pedestrians feel like they always have the right of way and refuse to pause for two seconds while I pedal past so I don’t have to stop completely.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In any case, it’s not a bad idea to prepare for the worst case scenario. One precautionary&nbsp;action you can take? Using technology to document what happened.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use technology</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I ride with a GoPro on my handlebars because D.C. has contributory negligence and that combined with MPD’s general apathy toward bike/car crashes doesn’t leave me with much confidence,” says Redditor tiny_apt_brewer. “I got burned once so the GoPro became a $200 insurance policy.</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s not a bad idea, confirms another Redditor by the name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/voikya" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">voikya</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I do the same. I got hit by an Uber driver one time and it proved beyond any doubt that I was completely in the right. Completely paid for itself.”</p></blockquote>



<p>For roommates in Washington D.C., biking can be the ultimate way to experience your new city. So when you find roommates in Washington D.C. who love to bike around, be smart, be safe, and leave your tips for fellow cyclists below!</p>
