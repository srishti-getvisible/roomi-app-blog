<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had to sit through a job interview, then you know how important your resume is! It&#8217;s a way for you to market yourself and promote your career experience. It has your qualifications for a recruiter or hiring manager to clearly see. Your resume is one of the primary documents they use to decide whether or not you might be a fit for your dream job. But don&#8217;t worry, because Roomi has got some of the best career advice for you! </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s be real —crafting an effective and impactful resume so that you can secure a job interview requires much thought and hard work. A short paragraph of all your skills, experience, and professional history into a crisp document that grabs the hiring manager&#8217;s eyes within just a few seconds is a challenge.</p>

<p>So how can you make sure that your brilliance is captured in a one-page resume? A 2018 study by Ladders (online job-matching service) found that recruiters typically only <a href="https://www.theladders.com/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">spend about six seconds</a> reviewing an individual&#8217;s resume.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a tiny window of time to convince a stranger that you&#8217;re the right person for your dream job. The thought is daunting, but that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here- to give you impeccable career advice!</p>



<p> By including specific information on your CV, you significantly increase your chances of landing an interview, no matter what field you&#8217;re applying for!</p>

<p>So, to make the most of your six seconds, here are the five things you should always put on your resume:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-job-interview-basics-focus-on-your-accomplishments">1. Job interview basics: focus on your accomplishments</h2>



<p>This may be an obvious career advice, but it&#8217;s important to say anyway. Having an accomplishment highlighted on your resume looks impressive. Not to mention, it shows you off well. But remember, recruiters care more about the impact of your achievements. For example, how did you help your previous employers and customers? Has your work effort resulted in a sales boost? Can you confidently tell them that an initiative you led increased client acquisition? Or that you were responsible for their boosted revenue? Having the specifics down on paper will also help you during your job interview.  But remember to back your achievements with credible statements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-data-and-examples-will-help-with-the-job-interview">2. Data and examples will help with the job interview! </h2>



<p>It&#8217;s essential to provide data that validate your accomplishment and its impact. The more you highlight your achievements and their impact, the better it is. But the info you provide needs to be specific and linked to your achievement. For example, you can use numbers (everyone loves a good graph!) to elaborate quantifiable examples of success. This will let the hiring managers know that you&#8217;re the one for your dream job.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-a-clean-and-consistent-format">3. A clean and consistent format</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Once you&#8217;re in the room, the resume doesn&#8217;t matter much,&#8221; </p>
<cite>Laszlo Bock, former senior VP of people operations at Google.</cite></blockquote>



<p>But, to ensure yourself a job interview, your resume should be near perfect. But don&#8217;t worry, we have some great resume, or rather, career tips- </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use only black ink on white paper with half-inch margins.</li>



<li>Make sure all columns are aligned. </li>



<li>Keep <a href="https://picsart.com/fonts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fonts</a>, sizes, and spacing consistent. </li>



<li>Keep your resume tight. </li>



<li>Craft a concise and focused bio.  </li>



<li>Prioritizes the most critical information. </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-personal-touch">4. Personal touch</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re desperate to get a job interview, you may want to send the same resume to 50 different employers. But that&#8217;s not such a great idea. Your goal is to advance to the next round of the process. So, it is better to tailor your resume to match the job description. There is no better career advice than this. </p>



<p>While you&#8217;re at it, don&#8217;t just rely on your resume to get a job. Look for other ways to make your personality shine. Sending a cover letter could help you communicate more about who you are and what you can contribute to the company.&nbsp;It&#8217;s an excellent way to give the hiring manager a sense of your unique self, something quite challenging in a resume alone.</p>

								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-links-to-relevant-urls">5. Links to relevant URLs</h2>



<p>It can be stressful for the recruiters to review resumes back-to-back. Try making the hiring manager&#8217;s job easier by making explicit connections between your experiences and the job you want. This includes a link to your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/how-to-make-your-profile-stand-out-on-linkedin/1366/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn profile</a>, your blog, or your online portfolio. Because once they know how you can be helpful to their organization, you&#8217;re more likely to get a job interview.</p>
