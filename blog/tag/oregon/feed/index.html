<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How transit-friendly is Eugene?</h2>



<p>If you’re an outdoor enthusiast, there are plenty of ways to get outside in Eugene without a car! Biking and walking are obvious choices. If you are looking for rooms for rent in Eugene, here are some other ways to get around the city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Taxis</h3>



<p>Eugene is a walker-friendly city with lots of bike lanes and public transportation options. Unfortunately, walking and biking can be ineffective in the bitter cold or torrential rain. At times like these, you can always depend on taxi services like Uber and Lyft. Taxi is also one of the safest modes to travel in if you don&#8217;t own a car.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Particulars</strong></td><td><strong>Price</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Taxi Start (Normal Tariff)</td><td>$3.50</td></tr><tr><td>Taxi 1km (Normal Tariff)</td><td>$2.25</td></tr><tr><td>Taxi 1 hour Waiting (Normal Tariff)</td><td>$30.00</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Walkability</h3>



<p>With 156,185 residents, the average walkability score of Eugene is 45 out of 100. West University, Downtown, and Jefferson Westside are the most walkable neighborhoods in the city. Eugene is also a bikeable city, so you can simply hop on your bike when you need to pick up groceries!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Public transportation</h3>



<p>Public transportation in Eugene is provided by Lane Transit District (LTD). The LTD bus system has a fleet of 373 vehicles including small shuttles, large transit buses, and lift-equipped buses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cycling </h3>



<p>Eugene has always been one of the most bike-friendly communities in America. With over 200 miles of paths and trails, there is no shortage of great places to ride. One particularly beautiful ride highlights a classic Oregon landscape &#8211; the Willamette River. This route follows a stretch of path along the river between West Amazon Park and Coburg Road.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cultural activities in Eugene</h2>



<p>Eugene is home to a unique mix of cultures and activities. In the heart of downtown, you’ll find people from all walks of life. Each day, they gather at local cultural landmarks for festivals, performances, and more! And often, these events are free or low-cost for the community.</p>



<p>The Eugene Oregon Area has many great things to offer in the way of outdoor recreation. With horseback riding, mountain biking, hiking, and just about any other type of outdoor activity you can think of, it makes for a wonderful getaway.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sandboarding</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/outdoor-adventures/sandboarding/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sandboarding</a> is one of the most underrated activities in Oregon and even the Pacific Northwest! There’s only one place around here that offers trips like this, so if it appeals to your adventurous side (and who doesn’t like riding on sand dunes?) then don&#8217;t miss out. It&#8217;s SO much fun!</p>
