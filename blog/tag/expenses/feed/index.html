<p>For better or for worse, living with a roommate means sharing your life with them. Depending on your specific living situation, that could mean sharing your living room, the kitchen, the hallways and maybe even your bathroom and bedroom. But to make up for it, you&#8217;ll also get to share some laughs, some snacks and a whole lot of memories. However, there is one thing about living with a roommate that falls strictly in the “worse”&nbsp; category- managing expenses. Even the phrase &#8220;manage expenses&#8221; can send shivers down your spine!</p>

<p> No matter how comfortable you are with your roommates, talking about money is always a little weird. It’s one of those strange, almost taboo topics, that can instantly make any conversation awkward. But even so, it’s an extremely important conversation to have if you want to have a smooth-sailing relationship with them. So without any further ado, here’s a list of things you should keep in mind when it comes to sharing expenses with your roomis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Manage Expenses by making a plan</h2>



<p>The whole process of moving is so overwhelming that managing expenses is the last thing you want to do. The word “finance” alone is enough to induce anxiety. But believe us, this is an extremely important thing you and your roommates need to agree on before you do anything else.</p>



<p>Start with discussing which one of your expenses you will be sharing and which you want to pay individually. For example, you will have to split your rent but maybe you want to pay for your groceries on your own. Maybe you want to split your internet bill, but want to pay for your own streaming services. The combinations are endless and you will have to decide early on what works for your household.</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> To manage expenses better get separate electricity meters for your bedrooms. This way you only have to pay for the electricity that you use. The electricity costs of common areas can be split evenly. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bills, bills, bills</h2>



<p>Oh, the bane of everyone’s lives- the never-ending bills. You’ve got electricity bills, you’ve got water bills, you’ve got maintenance charges, you’ve got internet bills &#8211; the list goes on and on. It’s very important to decide how you&#8217;re going to be paying these bills before you even move in together. Since most of these bills will be shared expenses, these will be the ones that will cause the most trouble. Decide on a date by which everyone has to pay their share of the bills every month, and then make sure everyone does it. It’s okay if once in a while someone falls behind; it can happen to anyone. But if someone is habitually late paying up their share then that’s a major red flag &#8211; it might be time for a house meeting.</p>



<p>Also, make sure everyone knows how these bills are paid and have a rotational schedule on who will be responsible for collecting and paying the money. Otherwise, the responsibility will fall on the one person which can be <em>very</em> annoying.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Manage expenses separately</h2>



<p>While it’s inevitable that you will have to share a lot of your bills, remember to keep your expenses separate wherever possible. Don’t make any big purchases together; it will only make it harder to decide how to split it fairly when one of you is moving out. For example, buying furniture together is a big no-no. Whatever furniture you want to buy, buy on your own and that way you don’t have to worry about splitting it later on. You should even consider buying things like utensils separately. Make note of what belongs to you and take it with you whenever you move out.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi tip</strong> &#8211;&nbsp; Since most roomis find it easier to buy their groceries separately, divide up your kitchen cabinets between you and your roommate. This will make sure your groceries remain separate and you don’t accidentally eat someone else’s food.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep track of payments</h2>



<p>Even the best plans can go wrong, because life always finds a way to get in the way. There will inevitably come a time when you will have to cover for your roommate and vice versa. There will be unexpected purchases, expenses and the occasional cash-borrowing. The important thing is to pay them back. And the only foolproof way of managing expenses is keeping track of them. </p>



<p>There are a<a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-genius-apps-for-splitting-bills-with-friends" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> number of great apps</a> that can help you keep track of these payments and make your lives 1000 times easier. And if you’re slightly old-fashioned, then the good ol’ pen-and-paper duo never let anyone down. So do yourselves a favor and put it to use!</p>

<p>When coliving with Roomis, keeping track of expenses can be challenging. So you paid the plumber for that leaky sink, but they covered the gas bill last quarter. They complain because they paid for the communal spices, but you somehow always seem to be buying the toilet paper. Sharing expenses with roommates can be a nightmare for your bank account &#8211; and doing it wrong can cause arguments.</p>



<p>Our team at Roomi wants to ensure that you steer clear of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/annoying-habits-to-avoid-when-co-living-with-roomis-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the habits that put your in the &#8220;annoying roommate&#8221; zone</a>, which includes playing fair with coliving expenses.</p>



<p>To opt for a laid-back, “give-and-take” approach may feel like a good idea at first. However, it’s easy to feel like you’re paying more than your share of the expenses. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-etiquette-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roommate etiquette guidelines</a> dictate that one should be contributing to the costs of a coliving space. But beyond annoying spreadsheets &#8211; how do you keep track of expenses properly?</p>

<p>Like every problem on earth, you best believe there’s an app for that! Here are some handy tools you can use to split bills and expenses while coliving. A fool-proof guide to ensure all Roomis and their bank accounts are happy!</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-splitwise-easy-shared-expense-tracker">1. Splitwise: Easy shared expense tracker</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.splitwise.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splitwise</a> is a free tool that enables users to keep track of shared expenses, making it perfect for housemates or groups on vacation. You can easily add the things you pay for and how much they cost, and all housemates will get access to this.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://giphy.com/gifs/crying-jon-stewart-hAcDHEhZHA2bu
</div></figure>



<p>Whenever you want to settle the balance, Splitwise will calculate the difference in how much money people owe and are owed. It makes tracking expenses simple and &#8211; dare we say it &#8211; enjoyable!</p>



<p><strong>@zachBales on Reddit is a huge advocate of the app, saying:</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>“Splitwise is my life. It just keeps a running total and often things will just even out naturally as people pay for different things. If it doesn&#8217;t balance out then you can do an e-transfer each month. I haven&#8217;t personally found a more streamlined option than that.”</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-kittysplit-an-expense-tool-for-all-your-coliving-needs">2. Kittysplit: An expense tool for all your coliving needs!</h2>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.kittysplit.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kittysplit</a> works similar to Splitwise but is less widely used in the United States. It is a simple way to calculate who owes what and to whom. </p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>There’s no need to download an app here; Kittysplit works on all browsers and all devices.</strong></p>



<p>Reddit user @edcRachel explains some of the Kittysplit benefits on offer:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>“I&#8217;ve been using kittysplit.com to track and split expenses with friends for trips. It&#8217;s AWESOME and will let you define how things are split (percentages, add more people if you like, etc). You add an amount, list who paid, and who it&#8217;s split between. You can track money given as well. Super simple interface, and ability to download everything as CSV, search by date, etc.”</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-roomi-blog wp-block-embed-roomi-blog"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AcrFiKqGb7"><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/">Financial Planning Basics: The 6 Golden Rules To Save Money</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Financial Planning Basics: The 6 Golden Rules To Save Money&#8221; &#8212; Roomi | blog" src="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/embed/#?secret=mvGQbCYtbp#?secret=AcrFiKqGb7" data-secret="AcrFiKqGb7" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-pen-and-paper-the-official-prehistoric-expense-tracker-for-your-bank-account">3. Pen and paper: The official prehistoric expense tracker for your bank account</h2>



<p>The good old-fashioned pen and paper method never fails, and is a good option if you happen to live with techno-phobe roommates or are concerned about losing data if something were to go wrong with an app. Attach a list to the refrigerator with each roommate’s name, so they can record anything they buy.</p>



<p>For extra security and to avoid debates, you could even attach receipts. Just be sure you don’t use a whiteboard to track expenses, since anyone can make adjustments if they feel like it!&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>It makes sense to gather your roommates early on to establish which living expenses you plan on sharing. This can save you money, since it could mean only paying for one Netflix membership instead of three, for example. Some expenses you might want to share include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Movie streaming services</li>



<li>Rent</li>



<li>Maintenance bills</li>



<li>Gas/water/electricity bills</li>



<li>Household essentials such as toilet paper, bin liners, and cleaning supplies</li>



<li>Shared food items such as butter, salt, and sugar</li>



<li>Internet bills</li>



<li>Occasional services like hiring a <a href="https://eastsidepg.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plumber</a> or electrician</li>
</ul>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-contribute-to-a-shared-household-bank-account-to-separate-shared-expenses">4. Contribute to a shared household bank account to separate shared expenses</h2>



<p>If it works for everyone, one way to ensure everyone is paying their share is to set up a shared bank account. Each roommate would contribute a predetermined amount each month, which will be used to cover things like bills, unexpected expenses or repairs, and everyday household items.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://giphy.com/gifs/IntoAction-f7MO098FCipmq0eUpV
</div></figure>



<p>This, however, can lead to debates. Some months, housemates may need to contribute more to shared expenses than other months. In this case, everyone has to trust each other to not dip into the account for personal reasons.</p>
