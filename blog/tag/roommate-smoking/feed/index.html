<p>As we all know, a stoner regularly takes or is <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stoner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">habitually high on drugs</a>, for example, cannabis, marijuana. Living with a stoner roommate can be exhausting, but they live by etiquette that will guide you. Not every 420 friendly roommate abides by the same code of social behavior, but some guidelines can live with persistence.</p>



<p>There are pros and cons to living with a pothead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros of living with a pothead</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. They are creative thinkers.</strong></h3>



<p>While some stoner roommates sit around moping all day long, the majority run successful businesses. They say that weed relaxes an overactive mind and stimulates the brain to think outside the box. You can be rest assured that they won’t delay rent payments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Allows for deeper connection.</strong></h3>



<p>Living with a pothead allows for deeper connection, a special kind of bond. A stoner roommate tends to be more honest and vulnerable. They are very loyal, and this will open you to appreciate how endearing and incomprehensible they are. Your <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.420smokers.us/living-with-a-stoner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">420 friendly roommate</a> will have many hours of deep conversations with you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. They&#8217;re fun and chill.</strong></h3>



<p>Your 420 friendly roommate knows how to chill and have fun. You already know their favorite hobby is smoking, and they love to get cozily ensconced at home surrounded by food and friends. Sometimes they act differently, not in a scary way but probably more relaxed and high. Well, surprisingly, this can be a great thing since <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://elitedaily.com/wellness/how-much-weed-smoke-to-relieve-stress/1962753/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking pot relieves stress</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cons of living with a pothead</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>1. Losing connection with the outside world: </strong></h3>



<p>Living with a pothead who smokes too much weed will subconsciously let it diminish their opportunities to make the most out of life. They end <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/culture/from-a-stoner-to-a-stoner-why-smoking-too-much-weed-can-fck-up-your-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing their connection</a> with the outside world, not caring about what they see and what happens to them. It is a mental and physical numbness that triggers a loss of regard for the people, responsibilities, and potential for growth within your immediate and ever-evolving life.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>2. Accidentally eat a pot brownie</strong>.</h3>



<p><strong>I</strong>f your 420 friendly roommate is a jerk, they can sneak some, especially when they don’t respect your choices. The best thing is to avoid home-baked pastries or pastries you didn’t purchase or make yourself.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>3. They have a funky smell</strong>.</h3>



<p>Living with a pothead will leave your apartment smelling like burnt rope, and you have to get used to it. It’ll hang on your clean clothes and follow you everywhere. The bright side is some people like the tobacco smell.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>4. The fun doesn’t last</strong>.</h3>



<p>The <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.yourtango.com/201064123/9-pros-and-cons-dating-pothead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interesting stories</a> can get old after a while; if only weed makes them funny, your stoner roommate will stop being amusing and start to get on your nerves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Guidelines to note while living with a Pothead</strong></h2>



<p>Here are some guidelines to note when living with a pothead</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>When you want to host parties, your roommate would not want to be left out.</li><li>When you and your stoner roommate decide to host a party, communication is vital. As a non-smoker, you have friends who do not smoke and will like to be aware of your food choices. You need to communicate to guests, with the invitation and on arrival at your house.</li><li>You talk to them about the food and drinks you provide, whether they contain cannabis/marijuana, how much was incorporated, and the potential effects. Also, consider making food and drinks for non-stoner roommates and guests, so guests can easily make their choices. These are the things you put into consideration when <a href="https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/opinion/unique-complications-living-stoner/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living with a pothead</a>.</li><li>There are moments where living with a pothead will bother you as a non-smoker; this is what you should do: Honesty is the best way to go, but the way you deliver this message will let you know if the discussion will go well. You can ask if they have time to talk about some roommate topics on things that make them uncomfortable. State it simply without being offensive that you aren’t bothered about the smoking, but the frequency that they do it is getting to you. You can suggest that the windows are left open, or they do it outside sometimes. Whatever will make you feel more comfortable and know that there will be counter suggestions, but you have to find a balance that’ll satisfy you both as it is both of your apartment and you both need to be comfortable.</li></ol>

<p>Even though you’ve staved off the temptation and tried hard to avoid second-hand smoke, you just found out your roommate smokes in the apartment. Next time you’ll make sure to use a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate finder</a> that prevents unpleasant surprises like these. Here&#8217;s what you can do when find your roommate smoking in the apartment.</p>



<p>Smoking cigarettes used to be in vogue, but their well-known health risks have made the practice less socially acceptable today. Still, there are an estimated <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">40 million smokers</a> in the U.S. &nbsp;So naturally, you have your concerns. Your roommate’s crumpled clothes reek of smoke, and they always seem to miss the ashcan outside the apartment, leaving a fine carpet of rain-washed butts for you to trod over on your way in. </p>

<p>You’re worried about that unrelenting cough your roommate gets occasionally, or maybe you’re just grossed out and wondering what to do now. You enjoy your co-living situation, but the smoking is really getting to you. Not to worry; communication is key, and though your roommate has a right to their habits (no matter how detrimental), that doesn’t mean you have to suffer. We asked some nonsmoking roommates on how to clear the air when your roommate smokes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-help-my-roommate-smokes-in-the-apartment">Help! My roommate smokes in the apartment</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preventative-measures">Preventative Measures</h3>



<p>If you’re living with a smoker and you don’t smoke yourself, one of two things happened: They either moved in with the habit (and didn’t mention it) or they picked up later. In either case, you should set up some ground rules ASAP. Just like with taking out the trash or washing the dishes, you should settle on an agreement. </p>

<p>Are you okay with them smoking on the landing even if it lets some of the smoky air in? What about when it’s cold outside? Be clear what you’re willing to compromise on and what is a total dealbreaker.&nbsp;Some habits affect everyone, and you have a right to make your needs known. </p>

<p>It’s always important to&nbsp;communicate your issues with habits like smoking to potential housemates. And if you’re&nbsp;cool with the habit but need rules, make sure to set them down in your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-to-set-in-apartments-for-rent-with-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate contract</a>. This will prevent some of the problems discussed here.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s entirely possible that you knew your roommate smokes before they moved in, but now it’s become an issue.&nbsp;Such was the case with Courtney Mixon, whose #1 roommate (her husband), recently ceased a 20-year smoking habit. Mixon, not a smoker herself, affectionately recounted the ups-and-downs of her hubby’s habit.</p>

<p>“He would leave the butts and stuff in the ashtray…and it would annoy the crap out of me. But I emptied it. And the wrappers were everywhere cause the cats loved the crinkle sound.”</p>

<p>Barbara Denzer had similar complaints when she lived with a roommate who&nbsp;smoked for 15 years, noting that the consequences went beyond simple pet peeves.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“[Smoking] turned the ceilings in our house yellow. It made the house and all our clothes smell, it was a lot of work to combat that. But I also worried about our lungs,” she says.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Denzer says&nbsp;after moving away from that housemate, it was easier to avoid these situations.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“People went outside to smoke. Smoking wasn’t allowed in restaurants. It seemed like it was safer to live with.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But smoke and smell might be the least of your worries.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-nbsp-hazardous-habit">A&nbsp;Hazardous Habit</h3>

<p>It goes without saying that smoking is bad for you. And though everyone is entitled to their own habits, you’re also entitled to worry. According to TheRealCost.gov, smokers die about 10 years sooner, and almost one in five deaths in the U.S. can be tied to smoking. Denzer knows the dangers first-hand: Having lost a husband to lung cancer, she soon after found herself at risk for the deadly disease.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Three years [after my husband’s death] I had a pulmonary embolism, or blood clots in the lungs, which I barely survived. Two years after that, I had another pulmonary embolism, also a narrow escape from death,” says Denzer.</p>

<p>Mixon is thankful that her husband stopped while he could.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“He made it a point to quit because he has asthma,” she says, adding that she’s very proud of his success. “His asthma has gotten so much better! He doesn’t use an inhaler as much as he used to. He went from using one inhaler for three to four weeks and now he’s been using the same one since August 2015.”</p>

<p>Perhaps your roommate can’t be scared into quitting, but it doesn’t hurt to talk about it. If you’re concerned about their welfare, tell them. It’ll let them know you care. If you don’t want to combat their personal choices, but it affects you, politely ask for some space from the habit. The simple act of smoking outside or cleaning up their cigarettes might make all the difference for your peace of mind.</p>
