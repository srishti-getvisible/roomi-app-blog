<p>If you’re looking for a place to stay in New York for a brief period of time, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/finding-short-term-rentals-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">short term apartments</a> might be a great idea for you. Rentals are a great alternative to traditional hotels, especially if you’re <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/hacks-to-help-you-find-the-perfect-apartment-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking to rent an apartment</a> on a monthly basis in NYC. While short term rentals are more expensive than regular apartments, they are a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/7-reasons-try-short-term-rental-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great option</a> for many people. Whether you’re renovating your home or just a tourist in New York for a month, short term rentals might be just the thing you’re looking for. So, if you’re somebody in the market looking for a short term rental, here’s what you need to look out for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do your research on the neighborhood before you sign the lease for your short term rental</h2>



<p>Yes, we know, you’re not going to be living there for long, but knowing your neighborhood is a very good idea. There are many <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/finding-no-fee-apartments-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">areas in New York</a>, where renting short term apartments would be an unsafe choice. If it is an option, walk around the neighborhood once or twice to really get to know the vibe of the place. See what your potential neighbors are like. Trust us, it’s very easy to get stuck with terrible short term rentals if you’re unfamiliar with the city. Of course, this research becomes more difficult if you’re from out of town. In that case, do all your research online. See what other people have said about the neighborhood. The subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">AskNYC</a>, can be a fantastic resource for you. Ask any questions you have and we’re sure some good NYC samaritans will help you out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make a list of your wants/needs before looking at short term rentals</h2>



<p>Wouldn’t we all love to rent a beautiful fully-furnished penthouse that overlooks Central Park? But alas, our budgets bring us back down to earth and force us to be realistic. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/hacks-to-help-you-find-the-perfect-apartment-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apartment rentals in NYC</a>, especially if it’s on a monthly basis, are really expensive. So here’s where you really need to sit down and ask yourself what it is that you really want. Yes, a Central Park facing apartment is really nice, but do you really need it? Similarly, if you’re looking for short term apartments in New York for 3 or 4 months, it might be smart to invest in one that is fully furnished. Only you know the specifics of your situation, so make sure you do a cost/benefit analysis before signing anything.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure you know the legalities before looking at short term rentals</h2>



<p>As short term vacation homes have become more <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomis-year-in-review-what-the-2020-room-rental-market-looked-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular</a>, there has been some serious backlash from residents. Especially in New York where several communities have passed ordinances that regulate short term rentals. So, for example, you have to lease apartment rentals in NYC on at least a monthly basis, not less than that. Make sure you know the rules and regulations of the building beforehand or may end up paying for it, literally. All of this confusion around regulations has led to an increase in <a href="https://streeteasy.com/blog/nyc-rental-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scams</a>, and you really don’t want to get sucked into any of that. So, if you’re looking for short term apartments in New York, make sure you are fully informed about the legal aspect of renting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Right place, right time</h2>



<p>As you may already know, New York City is one of the most expensive places to live in the world. Which means that short term rentals are going to be even more expensive than regular apartments. But the thing is, you might actually get a very good deal depending on what time of year it is. So, for example, during peak tourist season, the rent for short term apartments in New York are going to skyrocket. You may even find it hard to find an apartment in the neighborhood you want. In this case, you will really have to make compromises and make the best of the situation. But if you can time your trip right, you might just find a great apartment at a great price. So, you might want to factor that in if you’re looking for apartment rentals in NYC on a monthly basis!</p>

<p><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/information-for-hosts.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City has strict short-term rental and Airbnb regulations</a> that ensure leasing hosts share their homes responsibly and maintain affordability throughout the five boroughs, as mentioned in our previous article on finding a short term rental furnished apartment in New York City.</p>



<p>For New York City, a short-term rental is a rental that takes place for more than 30 consecutive days, with the city’s regulations focused on ensuring that short-term rentals are about hosts sharing their home with guests rather than using multiple properties as unlicensed hotels.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/new-york-guide-the-five-famous-boroughs-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Related: Roomi's New York Guide: Understanding The Five Famous Boroughs</a></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Short term rental services (and one aggregate site), which help even the most wayfaring users find an interim home:</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://apt212.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apt212</a></h3>



<p>As the name implies, Apt212 focuses mostly on the Midtown and Downtown Manhattan market. Apt212 started as a brokerage in 2010 and they now specialize in matching renters with short term rentals. Their listings include room for rent in shared apartments along with private units in luxury buildings.</p>



<p>As mentioned on their website, no credit checks are required, but the renter does need to submit a background check — as is a practice across most agencies.</p>

<p><strong>THE COSTS:</strong></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s something extra we&#8217;d like our readers to know before they leave:</h3>



<p><strong>WHAT IS SHORT TERM RENTING IN A RENT STABILIZED BUILDING?</strong></p>



<p>Rent-stabilized buildings have restrictions on what residents can legally charge on sites like <a href="http://airbnb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airbnb</a> and <a href="http://booking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Booking.com</a> to prevent a disproportionate generation of income. A host can short-term rent a private room in a rent-stabilized building. But, they cannot charge more than the room’s proportional share of the rent.</p>
