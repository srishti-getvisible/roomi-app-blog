<p>A scornful look, the silent treatment, and passive-aggressive responses? Yep! Your roommate is definitely pissed and is probably drifting from you emotionally. Perhaps you were once best of friends &#8211; two peas in a pod. But something has changed, and now your roommate is refusing to even talk to you. If you&#8217;re wondering what changed, here&#8217;s a list of things that could be causing those problems with your roommates.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6 Common Problems With Roommates &amp; Their Solution</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Your behavior is inappropriate</h3>



<p>Maybe the reason your roommate isn&#8217;t talking to you is because of the inappropriate comments you pass casually, without even realizing you&#8217;re doing it. Perhaps you made some racist remarks, or made comments about their sexuality, or made fun of them/the things they do. Even if you meant no harm, chances are that your roommate is hurt or upset with your behavior. Ask them what&#8217;s bothering them and why are they being cold towards you. If you ask sincerely, your roommate will open up. Respect their feelings and make amends.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. One of the most common roommate problems &#8211; You owe them MONEY!</h3>



<p>Did your roommate lend you money that you haven&#8217;t returned yet? Are they paying for your share of groceries/food or bills? Think hard! If there have been such instances, then your roommate&#8217;s behavior towards you is justified. Most roommate troubles are centered on the unequal distribution of chores and money. Clear debts with your roommate, and always keep a tab, especially when your roommate is covering for you. Nobody likes a person who forgets to pay up.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Your roommate is introverted</h3>



<p>Your roommate could be a shy and quiet person who likes to read more and talk less. It&#8217;s in their nature, buddy &#8211; you can&#8217;t hold it against them. Give them time and space to open up to you, and by no means try to force a conversation on them. It will only make things worse.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Another one of the most common roommate problems: You owe them an apology!</h3>



<p>You had a crazy fight with your roommate last week, and ever since, they&#8217;ve been giving you the silent treatment. If your half-hearted apology hasn&#8217;t sorted this situation, maybe it&#8217;s time to sit like adults and talk about what&#8217;s bothering each of you. If they&#8217;re acting like a big old baby, take the initiative to start this discussion. Nobody likes a cold environment at home * shudders *.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Your roommate is going through something personal</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re an overthinker, you probably might be beating yourself up thinking &#8211;&nbsp;<em>Why is my roommate not talking to me? What did I do now?</em>&nbsp;It could be that you&#8217;ve done nothing wrong, and the issue lies somewhere else entirely! Perhaps they&#8217;re having a bad day, difficulties at work, are going through family or relationship strains. While you guys are thick and always discuss your problems, this time, they&#8217;re not ready to talk about it <em>(at least not right now)</em>. Give them their space and tell them that you&#8217;re there for them whenever they&#8217;re ready.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Maybe the real roommate problem is that they don&#8217;t like you</h3>



<p>This might sting <em>(a lot!)</em>, but hey, their behavior doesn&#8217;t define you. Your roommate may have suddenly decided that you two have nothing in common and perhaps shouldn&#8217;t talk. There could be plenty of reasons for this and, if this behavior seems unresolved after many conversations,&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">it&#8217;s time to find your soul roommate!</a>&nbsp;You&#8217;re an awesome individual, and no one can take that away from you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roomi advise for problems with roommates</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s natural to fight with roommates or to be in disagreement with them. However, to keep your house warm, lively, and away from negativity &#8211; promote the culture of open dialog. Set this culture from the beginning and always follow good roommate etiquette to coexist peacefully with everyone.</p>
