<p>The world was different in 2020. Unemployment as a result of COVID-19 has caused many recent grads to decide that living at home during this time is the best option for them financially. But between of retracted job offers, deferred semesters and lost internships, the class of 2020 has had a lot to learn.</p>



<p>Finding work during the pandemic has proven to be a challenge for everyone, especially young people with little career experience. There is a ton of uncertainty in the workforce right now, so try not to panic if you haven’t found a job yet. Here is some advice for current college seniors or graduates that are currently unemployed and living at home due to the pandemic!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dear class of 2020, allow yourself a break.</h2>

<p>First of all, give yourself a break and stop stressing! If you have recently graduated college or are graduating this year, don’t feel pressure to find a job right away. Many college grads take time off after graduation before their next endeavor, whether that’s graduate school, traveling, or entering the workforce. You don’t need to have your life figured out by your early 20’s!</p>



<p>While living at home, be sure sure to check in on your mental health. This is a stressful time for everyone, and we all <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-covid-essentials-to-keep-at-home-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cope with the stress of the pandemic differently. </a>It is important to take care of our minds and check in with ourselves every once in a while. You&#8217;ve got this!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Class of 2020 or not, don&#8217;t forget to enjoy the time you have at home.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/cameo-graduation-graduate-class-of-2020-inJNMiGqM1CBAigtK1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/inJNMiGqM1CBAigtK1/giphy.gif?resize=360%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="High School GIF by Cameo - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="360" height="480" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Think about it: when will be the next time you’ll be living at home with your family? We&#8217;ve seen so many college grads moving back home due to the pandemic, and worrying about losing that taste of independence once again.</p>



<p>Try to view living at home as a positive instead of a negative! For one, you’ll save a ton of money since you won’t need to worry about rent or other expenses. Second, you can also enjoy time with your family. Cherish the time you have living at home and try not to view it as a setback.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep building your resume!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/IntoAction-Srzor6ErxsOCXt9Pv4"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/Srzor6ErxsOCXt9Pv4/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="Graduation GIF by INTO ACTION - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="480" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Just because you’re living at home doesn’t mean you can’t keep adding to your resume. If you’re currently unemployed and aren’t having much luck finding a job yet, do other activities that you can put on your resume.</p>



<p>There are many opportunities for online volunteering that you can do during COVID-19, which is a great thing to add to your resume. If you have a lot of free time on your hands, take online classes that are useful for the career that you want to go into. Don’t feel stuck and instead view this as a time of opportunity!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep your search on, and your head held high.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/moodman-2020-Tjjr8OXolrue0evTMx"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/Tjjr8OXolrue0evTMx/giphy.gif?resize=278%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="2020 GIF by MOODMAN - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="278" height="480" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Don’t lose hope! Make sure to keep applying to jobs that you’re interested in even if you’ve faced multiple rejections. You never know when you might get an acceptance. In addition,<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/top-tips-for-professional-growth-in-2021-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> keep doing research about possible jobs within the career field that you want to go into.</a></p>



<p>Use LinkedIn and connect with college alums in order to get more information about the job that you’re striving for. If you’re really feeling stuck, reach out to your college’s career services office and speak with them. Your college is still there to help you even after you’ve graduated!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So you&#8217;re walking around the house hating your job and singing &#8216;work sucks, I know&#8217;? You need a shift in perspective so you can stop saying &#8216;I hate my job so much&#8217; all the time.</p>



<p>Before we start our lives as working adults, and especially when we&#8217;re college seniors, we might romanticize about work. We might find ourselves daydreaming about how we&#8217;ll be conquering the world with our skills and talents. And how we&#8217;ll be earning money by the day, and sipping margaritas at business parties by night.</p>



<p>Although, unfortunately, a few months after you start working, you might find yourself gulping down beers with your friends. All while you constantly complain about hating your job while they roll their eyes and listen to the same old story.</p>



<p>So how do you continue to work at a job you absolutely hate (without losing your sanity)?</p>



<p>Even though it might not always be possible to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/turn-any-job-into-your-dream-job-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn any job into a dream job,</a> it is possible to bridge the distance between hate and love for your job and find a bearable middle ground to stop hating your job.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. List down the things that make you say &#8216;I hate my job so much!&#8217;</h2>



<p>Write out a hate letter to your job. (Don&#8217;t send it in to your boss) but get those feelings out on paper to better understand why you keep saying, &#8216;I hate my job so much.&#8217; Once you&#8217;ve done that, evaluate if you can make any changes to stop hating your job. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some things to think about while you do that:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Will another job solve the problems that make you hate your current job?</li><li>If not, can you change something in your own mindset to solve those problems?</li></ul>



<p>The fact remains that all jobs come with a list of pros and cons. What you need to ask yourself is &#8211; &#8216;what are the cons I can deal with&#8217;?</p>

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l0MYSCYtvpbUqmG8U" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYSCYtvpbUqmG8U/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Release the negativity to stop hating your job</h2>



<p>Your friends might be annoyed by your constant venting about hating your job, but that&#8217;s what friends are for! So vent it out every chance you get, but while you do that, don&#8217;t forget to evaluate the content of your venting. And when a friend offers advice, don&#8217;t follow up with &#8216;no.. but.&#8217; Instead, try and hear what they have to say and think about whether their advice can work in your favor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Crying can be good for you </h3>



<p>If that doesn&#8217;t help, break down in the shower without any shame or guilt. Cry it out and let the toxicity out to stop hating your job. Once the negativity is released, you can look at your problems with a clearer mind, and thus find more effective solutions.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:75%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3orif87PrC7NVurxAs" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3orif87PrC7NVurxAs/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Reach out to colleagues and make friends at the job</h2>



<p>Even though nothing else might be working out at the job, there are always people you can relate to. So don&#8217;t be stuck to your screen texting people &#8216;I hate my job so much.&#8217; Try to find the ones who seem chill enough to share a couple of beers with.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">This also helps with networking and finding new jobs when you&#8217;re hating your job!</h3>



<p>At the end of the day, what you make of your time right now matters the most. So instead of constantly hating your job and dreaming of better things to come, reach out to people and find your office tribe!</p>



<p>Bonus: Bitching about your boss with office friends will be much more fun than with friends outside of work! Just be careful about who you share with!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Find another purpose to stop hating your job</h2>



<p>Making money is a significant need to survive in the world. But does it have to be your only purpose in life?</p>



<p>Even if you have your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/how-to-choose-your-dream-career-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">dream career</a>, it&#8217;s impossible to love all aspects of it at all times. Finding something outside of the job can help fulfill your sense of purpose and give you a boost in confidence and self-esteem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Find a hobby or a skill to learn</h3>



<p>You could cultivate or polish an existing hobby or put time into learning a new skill. Find anything that gets your mind off of hating your job, while giving you more meaning to the life you&#8217;re living.</p>
