										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you’re thinking of looking for an apartment but don’t really know where to start, we’ve got you! We understand the stress of planning to move, apartment hunting, and even budgeting. More than that, there’s always this question of, “when should I start looking for an apartment?”. The apartment rental market can be unpredictable, so having an apartment hunting timeline is the best way to prepare for your move.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When Should I Start Looking for an Apartment?</h2>





<p><a href="https://au.reachout.com/-/media/young-people/images/legacy-articles/moving-boxes-around.jpg">Source</a></p>



<p>If you’re planning to move out, the question of when to look for an apartment totally depends on you. But, there’s an apartment hunting timeline you can follow that’s easy and will make moving out totally hassle free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Ideal Apartment Hunting Timeline</h3>



<p><strong>2-3 months before moving in:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Do your research.</strong> There are a lot of things you should consider before actually moving in. The first is deciding when and where: when’s your move-in date and where you’ll be moving in. Your move-in date is crucial because you’d have to think of your current lease, your job, and even insurance policies.</li>



<li><strong>Start budgeting.</strong> The second step is knowing your budget and sticking to it! Once you have a move-in date, you’ll be able to get a better grasp on when you need to start allotting money for your new apartment. Plus, getting a head start on an apartment fund can be beneficial for you; you can have extra cash in case of emergencies.</li>



<li><strong>Understand how applying for apartments work.</strong> Once you have your date and budget, knowing how applying and renting apartments work. This way, you can prepare any extra documents that’ll take time to get, just in case.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>24 to 30 days before moving in:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prepare all requirements.</strong> Having all of your documents ready before starting to look is one of the best apartment hunting tips you should know. This way, the application process will be a lot more smoother and hassle-free.</li>



<li><strong>Tour apartments.</strong> Now, a lot of people ask, “when should I start looking for an apartment?” there’s an ideal time frame for this! Looking three to four months out is too far, and two weeks is cutting it too short. Usually, apartments are listed 24 to 30 days before the move-in date, so an apartment available on September 1 will probably be put on the market on August 1.</li>



<li><strong>Make a list.</strong> Now that you somewhat have an idea where you’ll be moving to, it’s best to list down your top choices, from the type of apartment, to the available amenities, accessibility, how close it is to your work, the hospital, banks, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Put in an application on your top pick.</strong> Once you have everything and you’re set on a place, put in a rental application. Usually, you’ll know whether you’re approved or not within five business days.</li>



<li><strong>Confirm the move-in date and start packing.</strong> If you have any more outstanding paperwork to sign, this is the best time to schedule a time for it. Make sure that all the documents you need are good to go.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>7 days before moving in:</strong></p>





<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/UTw3j_aoIKM">Source</a></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Confirm your moving details.</strong> Whether you booked movers or asked help from friends, this is the time to finalize all the details.</li>



<li><strong>Pack all your essentials in one bag.</strong> Put at least a few days worth of clothing, necessities, paper work, and important IDs in one bag for easy access. In case you need anything, it’ll be easier to find and get.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Moving day:</strong></p>



<p>On the day of your move-in, it can get a bit stressful. But if you followed the timeline and have all your documents ready, you don’t have to worry. You can expect the unexpected, but by the end of the day, you’ll be in your new apartment!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Apartment Hunting Tips</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Think about what you really need in an apartment. When searching for apartments, it’s important to think of your needs more than your wants. Do you really need that extra room or is one enough?</li>



<li>Familiarize yourself with the lease terms and obligations. Before signing anything, take time to review it. If the landlord seems like they don’t want you to go through it, that’s generally a bad sign. Without reading the lease terms, you may be signing yourself up for terms you disapprove. Also, come prepared with a list of questions when meeting with the landlord! Make sure that if you’re planning to sign the contract and live there, your living situation is the best for you (and your landlord).</li>



<li>Be wary of rental scams. If you’re planning to move, make sure that you have your guards up. Use <a href="https://roomiapp.com/">trusted room finders</a>, do reverse image searching, and meet the landlord or property manager before paying a deposit. Rental scams will always be there, but you can avoid it!</li>
</ul>

<p>New York City and Los Angeles are among the most bustling metropolitans in the world. Comparing and trying to choose between two big cities can be a daunting task for anyone. But, fret not, we’re here to make this choice easier for you. You’re definitely in for an exciting journey ahead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NYC vs LA: What is the difference?</strong></h2>



<p>The first difference one cannot go without mentioning is the location of both cities. Located on the two opposite coasts, NYC and LA experience two different geographies and climates.</p>



<p>However, in spite of East Coast vs West Coast, the two cities have more in common than one would think. Whether you’re considering <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/pros-and-cons-of-living-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living in LA</a> or living in NYC, cultural and lifestyle factors and feedback can be subjective.</p>



<p>We’re here to help you make the practical choice. Below, we’ll be answering questions on the differences between housing costs, transportation facilities, safety, job opportunities, and more!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the housing costs?</strong></h3>



<p>Be it living in NYC or living in LA, both cities have an exceptionally high cost of living compared to other cities around the world.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weather in NYC vs LA</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re someone who likes to spend more of their time outdoors, comparing the weather should be high up on your priority list. Considering the different terrains of both cities, the weather tends to follow suit.</p>



<p>In New York City, you get to experience all four seasons. In winters, it’s bitter cold with snow and you must pack your good <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/nyc-winter-essentials-what-should-i-pack-for-new-york-in-winter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">winter essentials</a>. In the summers, it’s sweltering!</p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/beach-pacific-palisades-california-4694432/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>On the other hand, Los Angeles experiences clear skies, sunshine, and warm weather almost all year long. With the proximity to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/best-beaches-in-la/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful beaches</a>, it is the classic Mediterranean weather. It’s sunny and always a great season for the beach. However, wildfires and earthquakes are also quite frequent.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transportation Facilities in NYC vs LA?</strong></h3>



<p>Thinking about ways to get around the city? The options available in NYC and LA are drastically different.</p>



<p>In the city that never sleeps, you will find plenty of transportation facilities. Buses, subways, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/getting-to-know-nycs-ferry-system-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ferries</a>, and taxis are easily available and almost nobody owns a car. New York is much more walkable and hence, the transportation costs are also lower on average.</p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/pedestrians-crossing-traffic-1853552/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>Los Angeles on the other hand is known as the driver’s city. If you are someone who loves to drive around for everything, choose LA. Despite the heavy traffic, it is a better choice than public transportation. If you don’t own a car, there are plenty of ride-sharing apps.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Job opportunities in both cities</h3>



<p>This is the most important question for modern young professionals. Comparing NYC vs LA, both offer an equal number of job opportunities. Generally speaking, the Big Apple has greater opportunities in the finance sector while LA offers the best jobs in the tech world and entertainment industry.</p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/man-notebook-new-york-businessman-1071770/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>NYC also offers higher-paying jobs, considering the higher costs of living when compared to Los Angeles. However, the decision comes down to the industry and lifestyle that suits you best.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Which <strong>city is safer to live in?</strong></h3>



<p>Considering the crime rate, NYC is considered much safer ever since the 90s. The crime rate has significantly reduced in the past couple of years allowing people to walk more freely around the neighborhoods.</p>



<p>LA however suffers from a higher crime rate with significantly more violent crimes reported in recent years. Even though the LAPD is toiling hard, according to the trends, LA is not for the soft-hearted.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where do I find the best food and lifestyle?</strong></h3>



<p>Both the cities offer plenty of varieties for food lovers. Whether you are a health freak or want world-class cuisines, you get it all. Apart from that, you have plenty of nightclubs, theatres, and entertainment options in both cities.</p>

<p>Living in NYC, you can get the best fast-food chains and top-rated restaurants. With exceptional luxury and low-cost outlets, New York has something for everyone. It is also a city full of diversity and hence, you can get your favorite cuisines in multiple hotspots. The New Yorkers truly know how to work hard and play harder!</p>



<p>Comparatively, Los Angeles has a more laid-back vibe. You will feel a greater sense of relaxation. There is a greater inclination towards spirituality and fitness. Thankfully, that does not translate to a lack of options.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Living in NYC vs Living in LA: How to make the best decision?</strong></h3>



<p>Having gone through the major aspects of both the cities, NYC vs LA is a tough call. When it comes down to living expenses, both cities have their pros and cons. If rent is higher in NYC, the transportation costs are the trade-off in LA.</p>



<p>The weather in LA is better if you love the sunshine. But if you want more variety from time to time, NYC has it all. Yes, it’s a concrete jungle but there are plenty of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/a-guide-to-the-abundant-outdoors-of-new-york-part-1/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">outdoors to explore</a> as well.</p>

<p>Looking for new places to grab a quick and economical bite to eat in the Big Apple? Street food in NYC has always been a big part of the city’s culture. Rich or broke, young or old, there can’t be many New Yorkers that wouldn’t readily agree to a hot dog.</p>



<p>The tricky thing about food carts, however, is that they’re constantly on the move. So, if you like one, you’d better save their phone number!</p>



<p>To help you keep track, we’ve pinned down the current locations of all the best street food vendors in NYC. You could be a newbie to New York or a native, looking for that one food cart you loved but lost. Whatever the case may be, the food trucks on this list will not disappoint you!</p>



<p>Take a look below.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. NY Dosas</h2>

<p>Located in Washington Square Park, this food cart operates from 11am &#8211; 3pm every day except Sundays. It serves authentic South Indian food so good that it’s even got its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NY_Dosas" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>



<p>The cart is owned and run by just one man, Thiru Kumar, who’s basically a local celebrity. And he makes some of the best Indian street food in NYC. The dosas (a savory, Indian-style crepe) and samosas are its most popular items, highly sought-after by college students.</p>



<p>The dosas are served with sambhar and coconut chutney. And unlike a lot of street food in NYC, all the food is fully vegan and gluten-free. After finishing your mouthwatering meal, you can pay by either cash or Venmo.</p>



<p>Thiru posts regular updates about the cart on his <a href="https://twitter.com/nydosas?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nydosas/?hl=en" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> pages.

<p>Mom’s Momo serves some of the most famous street food in New York. It&#8217;s located in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/UvPA3n1mz8Q5kE7n7" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackson Heights</a> and serves traditional Tibetan cuisine. Momos are steamed flour dumplings, usually filled with meat or vegetables, and served with spicy schezwan sauce. As far as street food in NYC goes, there aren’t many carts that serve momos like this!</p>



<p>Mom’s doesn’t have a large menu, which we feel adds to its appeal. They serve a select few dishes that will leave you licking your fingers off. One review states, “The dumplings were a form of perfection never before realized on this planet.” Need we say more?</p>



<p>So forget the FOMO and just try these momos. For regular updates, you can follow their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/momsmomo18/?hl=en" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page. And, if Jackson Heights is too far, you can check out their second truck in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cBCDf8JDoGsKrsBH8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Queens Boulevard, Sunnyside</a>.</p>

<p>Operating since 1982, Ling’s serves some of the best Manhattan street food. From its name, you can probably tell that the cart serves sweet cakes. For just $1, you can buy a bag full of the original-flavored fried cakes. Their fluffiness makes it super easy for you to finish them off without much help!</p>



<p>While these cakes are also served with multiple condiments, Ling’s regulars suggest eating them as they are. So, for some of the lightest and sweetest street food in NYC, give Ling’s shot.</p>



<p>Ling’s is located on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/e81ZA8yNiLVVMyQB6" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Manhattan’s Canal Street, Chinatown</a>. And, though not very active, you can visit their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LingsSweetMiniCakes/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a> page to learn more about them!</p>

<p>Kwik Meal is owned and run by former Russian Tea Room chef, Muhammed Rahman. The most talked-about and sought-after meal at this Manhattan street food cart is its marinated lamb.</p>



<p>The lamb is marinated overnight in multiple spices, yogurt, and green papaya. Then it’s served up in a slice of pitta bread or over a plate of basmati rice. We think it’s some of the tastiest street food in NYC.</p>



<p>Is your mouth watering yet? The cart’s owner is also quite a treat, serving up fun conversations along with his food.

<p>On the contrary, the chicken biryani served here is a foodie favorite, with meat that’s super tender and well spiced. Besides that, some other popular dishes are chicken tikka, kati rolls, and samosa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2020 Jacob and his friend rented a studio apartment somewhere in Los Angeles. When the lease ended in 2021, Jacob and his friend waited for his landlord to communicate the additional amount they now needed to pay to stay in the same apartment. But they never heard about the rent increase from the landlord.</p>



<p>If you’re a tenant in L.A. and wondering if there will be a rent hike at the end of your lease period, know that landlords in L.A. are now prohibited from raising the cost of more than 650,000 rent stabilizes units citywide. If you live in Los Angeles, know that there will be <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2022-01-03/even-in-hot-market-most-l-a-tenants-wont-face-rent-increases-for-at-least-another-year" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">no rent hikes for L.A. tenants until 2023</a> and possibly beyond. That&#8217;s not all. Los Angeles has important complex tenant laws. Knowing them well before moving into the city can help you save money on rent. Read on to learn about rent control in Los Angeles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-rent-control-laws-in-los-angeles">What are rent control laws in Los Angeles?</h2>



<p>In Los Angeles, the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) is a law that restricts the rent amount a landlord can charge from a tenant. It also limits the reasons for eviction. The law is enforced by the Rent Stabilization Board (RSB) of Los Angeles.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-do-you-need-to-know-about-rent-stabilization-in-los-angeles">What do you need to know about rent stabilization in Los Angeles?</h2>



<p>A rental unit in Los Angeles might be subject to the <strong><a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/los_angeles/latest/lamc/0-0-0-195151" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">city’s Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO)</a></strong>, which protects tenants from unfair rent hikes and evictions provided the unit is built on or before October 1, 1978.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-rent-control-work">How does rent control work?</h2>



<p>Rental control in Los Angeles means a cap on the annual rental increase on units. So if you’re a renter in L.A., you can usually expect a rent rise between 3 and 8 percent annually.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-things-you-should-know-about-rent-controlled-apartments-in-los-angeles">Key things you should know about rent-controlled apartments in Los Angeles</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Landlords need to give at least 30 days&#8217; notice before a rent increase.</li><li>Tenants can expect a 1% increase in rent every year for all the utilities that the landlord pays.</li><li>Landlords cannot increase the rent more than once every 12 months.</li><li>If the rent increases, landlords are free to raise the security deposit</li><li>If you’re going to have an additional roommate who was not on the original lease, the landlord may raise the rent by 10%. But if a roommate who was initially in the lease moves out, the landlord needs to reduce the rent by the same amount.</li><li>The landlord is bound to pay relocation assistance for no-fault eviction where the tenants have no fault. The amount may range from $8,500 to $21,200. The exact amount depends on the reason for eviction, the tenant’s income, and the duration of the tenancy.</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-areas-in-los-angeles-have-rent-control">What areas in Los Angeles have rent control</h2>



<p>The law covers Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Inglewood, West Hollywood, and some unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-your-apartment-falls-under-the-rent-increase-law-in-los-angeles">Is your apartment falls under the rent increase law in Los Angeles</h2>



<p>If you live in a unit built before October 1, 1978, it is covered by RSO. Mobile homes in parks are also covered under this act. To know when your apartment was built and if it’s covered under the rent control in Los Angeles, check with the <a href="http://zimas.lacity.org/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">city’s property database</a>. You can find the information with just a few clicks. Know that even if your building meets all the specifications, it might be prevented from being covered by the RSO. This may happen under certain instances:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The unit is a government-funded property.</li><li>It is a luxury apartment.</li><li>The unit was completed after 1978</li><li>You live in a single-family home, and it’s the only building on the property</li><li>Hotel and motel rooms occupied for less than 30 days</li><li>Commercial buildings that were converted to residential buildings after October 1, 1978</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="do-rent-control-laws-in-los-angeles-allow-eviction">Do rent control laws in Los Angeles allow eviction?</h2>



<p>While living in rent-controlled apartments gives protection to a certain extent to tenants, however, you can still be evicted. Under rent control in Los Angeles, evictions are allowed in the following situations:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Creating a nuisance</li><li>Subletting the unit to someone else illegally</li><li>Causing damage to the property</li><li>Not paying rent</li><li>Not obeying the rental agreement</li><li>Using the rented property for illegal activities</li><li>Failure to provide the landlord with reasonable access to the property</li></ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="benefits-of-staying-in-a-rent-controlled-apartment-in-l-a">Benefits of staying in a rent-controlled apartment in L.A</h2>



<p>Apart from protection against unjustified eviction or increased rent, you may receive 1% interest per year on your security deposit if you live in a rent-controlled unit for at least a year.</p>



<p>You can also file a complaint if you find your apartment is in an inhabitable condition or if there is an overcharge of rent. In such a scenario, you will be entitled to the reduced rent.</p>



<p>If the building is inhabitable and the landlord doesn’t rehabilitate it, the city can take over the building in rare extreme cases. You’re also eligible for reduced rent, and the city will restore the apartment to a livable condition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rent-control-in-los-angeles-amidst-covid-19">Rent control in Los Angeles amidst COVID-19</h2>



<p>While landlords generally raise rents between 3-8 % annually, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has changed the scenario. After the 2020 pandemic, the mayor’s emergency order mentions that no landlords can increase the rent. However, they can charge a new rent once the tenant vacates and the new tenant moves in. This has been a historic decision, marking the first time in more than four decades under the rent control law in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>However, even with the rent freeze, many tenants in L.A. have suffered significantly in the last two years. While a handful of the white-collar employees have managed to work from home, the scenario is entirely different for the lower-income workers – especially in the hospitality and leisure industry. While the low-income tenants are eligible for rental assistance for $5.2 billion in federal funding to pay previously owed and future rent, there remains a high demand for assistance.</p>

<p>Considering a move to New York City? There are probably a thousand and one decisions for you to make. But one of the most important ones is which borough you’re going to move to. A lot of newcomers are stuck choosing between Manhattan and Brooklyn because of their reputations. So which borough is best for you: Brooklyn vs Manhattan? Which comes out on top? Well, that all depends on your personal requirements.</p>



<p>Keep reading if you want to find out whether Brooklyn vs Manhattan is better suited to your needs.</p>

<p>Brooklyn and Manhattan are two different but equally charming boroughs. They’re also both top destinations for people looking for new jobs, career opportunities, and those moving for school. To decide which is better for you between Brooklyn or Manhattan, here are a few things for you to consider:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-rental-cost">1. <strong>Rental Cost</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re gunning for a studio apartment, there’s not much difference in the rental costs in Brooklyn vs Manhattan. In 2019, the median <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-manhattan/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rent in Manhattan</a> for a studio apartment was $1848 a month. In Brooklyn, for the same kind of property, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the median rent</a> was $1952.</p>



<p>However, when you start looking at larger apartments, the coin flips, and the cost difference becomes steeper. The rent in Manhattan may be double what it is in Brooklyn. Plus, apartments in Manhattan tend to attract a higher property tax (because they are valued more highly).</p>



<p>Your choice will eventually boil down to the size of your budget and your preferred apartment choice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-type-of-building">2. <strong>Type of Building</strong></h3>



<p>While some people like the beauty of townhouses, others like the convenience of a condo. When choosing between Manhattan vs Brooklyn, it’s a good idea to decide what kind of housing you want. Sure, you can find all kinds of houses in both boroughs. However, Manhattan is known for its skyscrapers and townhouses. On the other hand, Brooklyn is famous for its loft spaces and cobblestones.</p>



<p>As a result, it will generally be easier to find an apartment in a skyscraper in Manhattan than in Brooklyn. And it’ll likely be easier to get a loft apartment in Brooklyn rather than Manhattan.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-cost-of-living">3. <strong>Cost of Living</strong></h3>



<p>The cost of living in Brooklyn vs Manhattan is lower. Whether you’re shopping or dining, living in Manhattan is way more expensive than living in Brooklyn. You have to pay significantly more for the same standard of living.</p>



<p>However, the median income in Manhattan is also higher. This means, if you live and work in the borough, your salary will cover your increased living expenses. So, in the end, it’ll boil down to almost the same cost.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-commute-time">4. <strong>Commute Time</strong></h3>



<p>How much time are you willing to spend in traffic when you’re going home or to work? Thanks to its huge population and the large numbers of tourists, traffic is heavy in New York.</p>



<p>Between Brooklyn vs Manhattan, the commute time is faster in Manhattan. Not because there is less traffic, but because there are multiple public transport options around the borough. Bear in mind, too, that many of the people that work in Manhattan live in Brooklyn. This contributes to a longer commute time.</p>



<p>But don’t let this put you off if you have your heart set on living in Brooklyn. A lengthier commute gives you time for relaxation, meditation, or catching up on your favorite sitcom!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-crime-rate">5. <strong>Crime Rate</strong></h3>



<p>The crime rate has <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/pr0502/index-crime-continues-decline-april-2019#/0" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued to decline in New York City</a> over the past two decades. According to Neighborhood Scout, Brooklyn and Manhattan have similar crime scores. This is despite them having different population sizes.</p>



<p>Regardless of where you decide to move to, you’ll want to feel like you are safe. So, here are a few emergency numbers for the city of New York for you to note down:</p>



<p><strong>Police or Fire Emergencies</strong>: 911</p>



<p><strong>NYC Information</strong>: 311</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-food">6. <strong>Food</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re as much of a foodie as I am, then you’ll want to choose a borough with great restaurants. Between the two boroughs, Manhattan boasts the best dining halls and restaurants. You’ll be spoiled for choice trying to decide which to choose on your next outing.</p>



<p>But don’t rule out the restaurants in Brooklyn either. With classy customer service, lively atmospheres, and breathtaking views, Brooklyn restaurants have it all. Plus, you can expect to get more varied options for cheaper prices in Brooklyn than in Manhattan.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-quality-of-life">7. <strong>Quality of Life</strong></h3>



<p>Manhattan and Brooklyn are top destinations for people looking for work, schooling, and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/fun-things-to-do-in-manhattan-in-a-single-weekend/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">fun in the Big Apple</a>. And rightly so. The quality of life in both boroughs is very high. But Brooklyn just clinches it. While <a href="https://www.homesnacks.com/il/manhattan/#cost-of-living" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Manhattan has a quality of life index</a> of 107, Brooklyn has a <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/in/Brooklyn" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">quality of life index</a> of 136.32.</p>



<p>Clearly, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-perks-brooklyn-apartments/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living in Brooklyn has it perks</a>, but so does living in Manhattan. But which one is best for you?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s difficult to escape learning about the Bay Area&#8217;s high cost of living when considering relocating there. The average monthly rent in San Francisco is about $3,600. Start saving now if you&#8217;re thinking of purchasing a property there because the median home value is $1.3 million!</p>

<p>The high cost of living in San Francisco is mostly due to demand exceeding supply, particularly because tight zoning restrictions prevent &#8220;Manhattanization,&#8221; or the development of towering, high-density homes. Living with roommates and picking a good location will help! But, expect to spend a significant portion of your income on housing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-homelessness">2. Homelessness</h3>



<p>San Francisco does not have a larger ratio of people who are homeless than other large American cities. However, a combination of conditions, including warm weather, a shortage of space, and a huge population of unsheltered homeless people, has caused the problem to spread rapidly.</p>



<p>The homeless problem in San Francisco is also more evident than in other places. Because the Tenderloin, the city&#8217;s poorest area, is near South of Market (SoMa), the city&#8217;s wealthiest commercial district, it&#8217;s not uncommon to find homeless people strewn amid high-rise office buildings and luxury condominiums.</p>

<p></p>



<p>You&#8217;re likely to spend a lot of time caught in traffic if you plan on having a car in San Francisco to go across the Bay Area. In addition to the sky-high cost of living in San Francisco, it also had the fifth-worst traffic congestion in the world in 2017. Additionally, it has the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://inrix.com/scorecard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-worst</a> traffic congestion in the United States, with drivers spending an average of 79 hours stuck in traffic. Gas rates in San Francisco tend to be higher than in other places. So, idling in your car will cost you money.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-unpredictable-weather">4. Unpredictable Weather</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ll experience wide-ranging temperatures, as well as microclimates that cause weather variations within the city. Moreover, cold, powerful winds are usual, and wildfires and earthquakes are always a possibility. Some people are worried by the weather&#8217;s unpredictability, while others appreciate the general moderate temperature, which lacks snow and scorching heat.</p>



<p>Moreover, they don’t call San Francisco “Fog City” for nothing. It tends to blanket the west side of the city most heavily, to the point where Divisadero Street is often called the “fog line.” Some like the fog, however, thinking it gives the city character.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-moving-to-san-francisco-for-you">Is Moving to San Francisco for You?</h2>



<p>San Francisco, in addition to the regular difficulties of city life, has its own concerns to deal with. This includes a homelessness epidemic, headline-grabbing housing pricing, and unusual weather patterns. Of all, no city is ideal, so the pros and cons of living in San Francisco largely come down to your own priorities.</p>

<p>Everyone wants something different, and you can make what you want out of it. That being said, the pros and cons of living in San Francisco do not undermine its unique approach to “big city life”.</p>

<p>From Victorian charms to a booming economy &#8211; San Francisco has it all! San Francisco is also one of the most expensive places to live in the country. The average rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in San Francisco is currently $2,800. This is a 5% increase compared to last year. But San Francisco also has some of the most protected renters rights in the country.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Under the Rent Ordinance of 1979 and regulations by the&nbsp;<a href="https://sfrb.org/rent-ordinance">San Francisco Rent Board</a>, most renters in San Francisco are well protected from unwarranted evictions or substantial rent hikes.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a first-time renter <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-san-francisco/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking for a room in San Francisco</a>, you must know the renters&#8217; rights and the up-to-date rental laws in San Francisco. Sounds overwhelming? We&#8217;ve got your back! Read on as we have listed the essential tenant rights in San Francisco.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-do-you-need-to-know-about-tenant-rights-in-san-francisco">What do you need to know about tenant rights in San Francisco?</h2>



<p>Know that most renters residing in buildings predating June 1979 are protected by the <a href="https://www.sanfranciscoinjurylawyerblog.com/an-overview-of-san-franciscos-rent-control-ordinance/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rent Ordinance of 1979</a>. They are safeguarded from substantial rent hikes and evictions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-rent-control">What is rent control?</h3>



<p>The rental laws in San Francisco have a policy limiting the rent amount that a landlord can charge. It also limits the hike in rent that can be increased per year. There are different rent control laws for different cities in the US. Knowing the rent-control law can safeguard you from illegal rent hikes by your landlord.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="raise-in-the-rent">Raise in the rent</h3>



<p>The majority of the renters in San Francisco live in rent-controlled apartments protected by the Rent Ordinance of 1979. If you&#8217;re living in one such accommodation, know that your landlord can&#8217;t decide to raise the rent substantially. But if you&#8217;re living in a newer building, the rental laws in San Francisco won&#8217;t protect you. Also, you should know that in a rent-controlled apartment, rent can be raised once every 12 months. The rate is fixed at 2.6%. But if your landlord doesn&#8217;t raise the rent during one 12 month period, they can do it later with a larger increase in the hike rate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="eviction-and-tenant-rights-in-san-francisco">Eviction and tenant rights in San Francisco</h3>



<p>If your landlord asks you to move out, it doesn&#8217;t mean you have to. Alternatively, if you are covered under the <a href="https://sftu.org/rent-control/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">San Francisco Rent Ordinance</a>, you can only be evicted for one of the <a href="https://sftu.org/justcauses" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">San Francisco Rent Ordinance just causes</a> unless you share the rental unit with your landlord.</p>



<p>If you are covered under <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sftu.org/sf-v-ca-exemptions-to-rent-control-and-just-cause-9-21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">California law requiring just cause</a>, you can only be evicted for <a href="https://sftu.org/california-just-causes-for-eviction/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">California just causes</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, every eviction has to follow a specific legal procedure under the rental laws in San Francisco unless you are a sole lodger living with the owner.</p>



<p>In most cases, a “no-fault: eviction needs the landlord to pay the relocation amount.</p>

<p>According to the Rent Ordinance, if the landlords ask for eviction, they have to move in within three months and live there for at least three years. If they move out before three years, they should give the apartment back to you at the same rental rate.</p>



<p>If your eviction is under Ellis Act, you get the same protection rights for ten years with original rent for the first five years.</p>



<p>Under the rental laws in San Francisco, the same protection right will also apply to new homeowners who may buy the unit you were occupying. Since they are bound too by the Ellis Act, you will get the first preference if the new homeowner decides to move out within ten years and rent out their unit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="other-important-rental-laws-in-san-francisco-you-must-know">Other important rental laws in San Francisco you must know</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="about-the-deposit-money">About the deposit money</h3>



<p>The deposit money is still yours, even if it&#8217;s with your landlord. This means that the interest it accrues during your tenancy belongs to you. The&nbsp;<a href="https://sfrb.org/chapter-49-san-francisco-administrative-code-security-deposits-residential-rental-property">San Francisco Administrative Code</a>, section 49.2, says that you can claim the interest amount while moving out if you have lived for more than a year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="waiver-in-the-rent-amount">Waiver in the rent amount</h3>



<p>If you rented your apartment for a great view that was advertised, rental laws in San Francisco define it as a ‘perk’. You pay a substantial amount for it in the rent. If any new construction comes up eventually that blocks that view, you can apply to reduce your rent. You&#8217;ll need to file a decrease in service petition with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sfrb.org/index.aspx?page=1">Rent Board</a>&nbsp;for this. However, this does not apply to market-rate tenants.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="residing-in-an-illegal-unit">Residing in an illegal unit</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re still eligible for tenant rights if your landlord has created the house illegally after 1979, in most cases. That&#8217;s because an illegal unit doesn&#8217;t have a certificate of occupancy. And without it, landlords can&#8217;t claim the unit was created after 1979 and are exempted from Rent Ordinance. This gives eviction protections to renters.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="renters-right-during-a-natural-calamity">Renters right during a natural calamity</h3>



<p>If you need to move out in case of a fire, flood, or any other natural calamity, you can again move back to your unit once it&#8217;s repaired. You don&#8217;t need to pay additional rent for the repair or any increase the rent board allows, like an annual rent increase.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-do-in-case-of-harassment-by-your-landlord">What to do in case of harassment by your landlord?</h3>



<p>Know that your landlord can&#8217;t harass you for eviction by shutting off your utilities or locking you out. To protect the renters&#8217; rights, San Francisco voters passed Prop M, which defines and <a href="https://sftu.org/harass/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">prohibits harassment and gives tenants remedies</a>. These may include a rent decrease at the Rent Board, treble damages/$1,000 for each offense, and criminal penalties.</p>



<p>Remember that law is changed and updated from time to time, and rental laws in San Francisco are no exception. If you&#8217;re looking to rent a place in San Francisco, do your homework to understand your tenant rights. Although it will take some time and need your patience, you will be safeguarded if you know the tenant rights in San Francisco. The Tenants Union is a <a href="https://www.sftu.org/tenants-rights/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">great place to start</a>, and you can find chapter-and-verse citations of the <a href="http://www.sfrb.org/index.aspx?page=1240" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rent Ordinance</a> on the Rent Board site.

<p>Spending a day exploring <a href="https://goldengatepark.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Golden Gate Park</a> isn&#8217;t enough for some people due to its many attractions. It&#8217;s mapped just like Central Park in New York City and has museums, gardens, and various activities within the park. Here are some of the cheap things to do in San Francisco:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong><a href="https://www.calacademy.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Academy of Sciences</a>:</strong> As the most visited museum in San Francisco, the California Academy of Sciences is the gem of the park. It&#8217;s like going to a science fair with interactive exhibits, a four-story rainforest, and &#8220;<em>Claude</em>&#8221; the albino alligator! They have different kinds of tickets which range from $29 to $33 each, and they even offer a student discount.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.sfbg.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Botanical Gardens</a>:</strong> With more than 50,000 plants, visiting the Botanical Gardens is like going on a nature trip in the middle of the city. The garden also has meditation sessions and a botanical wreath-making class! Plus, admission is free for San Francisco residents, just bring a document showing your address and ID, of course. The Botanical Gardens is a great place to hang out with your roomies without spending a dime.</li><li><strong>Stow Lake &amp; Strawberry Hill</strong>: Head straight to Strawberry Hill and sit by the falls for a more peaceful and quiet retreat. Pro tip: bring a pair of binoculars for some bird watching, a camera, and packed food. Strawberry Hill has a small artificially made waterfall where you can take pictures and just relax. Plus, you can even meditate at the Golden Gate Pavilion or jog to the top of the hill. These are just one of the fun things to do in San Francisco.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="experience-the-magic-at-magowan-s-mirror-maze">Experience the magic at Magowan&#8217;s Mirror Maze</h3>

With black lights and &#8220;infinite mirrors,&#8221; escaping the maze sure is a challenge! You can spend a day in here and just let loose with your roomies!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="have-a-feast-in-chinatown">Have a feast in Chinatown</h3>



<p>One of the best things to do in San Francisco is <a href="http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">explore Chinatown</a>, the oldest and largest in North America. You can have a feast of the best Chinese food and walk through culture and history.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Chinese temples:</strong> There are many colorful temples you can visit with your friends while in Chinatown. Here, you&#8217;ll get a glimpse of the Chinese religious culture, and some offer rare historical artifacts. You&#8217;re free to enter the temples, but remember to keep the sanctity of the place by being respectful during your visit.</li><li><strong>Golden Gate Cookie Factory:</strong> If you&#8217;re curious about the process of making fortune cookies, visit the Golden Gate Cookie Factory for a free tour.

<p>Berkeley has been hailed as a culinary destination ever since Alice Waters opened <a href="https://www.chezpanisse.com/1/" class="broken_link">Chez Panisse</a> 50 years ago. This prompted the farm-to-table movement and introduced the best food in Berkeley. But the city has always been more than Chez Panisse. It is home to one of the Bay Area&#8217;s most eclectic and internationally diverse collections of restaurants.</p>
