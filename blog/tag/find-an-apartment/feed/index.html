<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding rooms for rent in Miami</h2>



<p>In land area, Miami is one of the smallest major cities in the United States. And most of the western fringes of the city border the Everglades, a tropical marshland covering most of the southern portion of Florida. Due to this, alligators that live in the marshes have ventured into Miami communities and onto major highways. Whether that&#8217;s fascinating, or terrifying, you decide!</p>

So here&#8217;s all you need to know about intercity transit when looking for rooms for rent in Miami, FL.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability &amp; Cycling </h3>



<p>Although Miami is a dangerous city for pedestrians, owing to the number of cars in the city, bicycling is a fairly considerable option for transit. In 2010, Miami was ranked the 44th-most bike-friendly city in the US according to&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bicycling magazine.</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Traffic</h3>



<p>The fact is, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article67616167.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Miami traffic is the worst</a>! The Dutch navigation and mapping company <a href="https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TomTom</a>, in its annual report compiled from 14 trillion GPS reports, declared Miami the seventh-most congested city in the United States. So stay prepared with <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/traffic/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waze</a> when you hit that road.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re still daring enough to take a <a href="https://www.miamiandbeaches.com/plan-your-trip/transportation/taxis-cab-services" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cab in Miami</a>, here&#8217;s a breakdown of the average rates. The good news is, most taxi drivers run a meter, displaying the fare you are expected to pay.</p>



<p>The rate in Miami starts at $2.95 for the first 1/6 mile and $.85 for each additional 1/6 mile until 1 mile then $.40 for each 1/6 mile after that.</p>



<p>Waiting time is $.40 per minute (or $24.00 per hour). You’ll also be responsible for any tolls during your trip. Additionally, tipping is optional but customary (and expected for good service which is usually 15 to 20 percent).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public transportation</h3>



<p>With Florida&#8217;s highest transit ridership on a daily basis, the public transportation is operated by <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.miamidade.gov/transit/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miami-Dade Transit</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.tri-rail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SFRTA</a>. It also includes commuter rail (Tri-Rail), heavy-rail rapid transit (Metrorail), an elevated people mover (Metromover), and buses (Metrobus).</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Take an art walk in Wynwood arts district:</strong> Taking place every second Saturday of the month, you can head over to Wynwood for gallery viewings with free drinks and music! Take in the street art and refreshing cocktails while being entertained by brilliant performers on every street corner.</li><li><strong>Participate in the Viernes Culturales in little Havana:</strong> Viernes Culturales or Cultural Fridays is an event that celebrates the best of Cuban culture. Think live music, dancing, Cuban art viewings, and of course people rolling and smoking Cuban cigars!</li><li><strong>Take a fascinating tour of the erotic art museum:</strong> Truly one of a kind, and the only museum devoted to fine erotic art in the U.S., this is a must see when in Miami. If not for the art, go for the spirit of ambition that resided in a Jewish grandmother (<a href="https://www.weammuseum.com/">Naomi Wilzig</a>) who traveled the world collecting erotic art pieces, amassing one of the largest collections in the world!</li></ul>
