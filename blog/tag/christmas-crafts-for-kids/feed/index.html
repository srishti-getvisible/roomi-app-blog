<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. A themed family games night</h2>



<p>The holiday season is a perfect occasion to cozy up, relax and have fun! If you find yourself searching for something more to do, why not organise a games night? We suggest you stick to holiday-themed games such as Christmas trivia, to keep things appropriately festive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Virtual wine tasting</h2>



<p>A Zoom wine tasting event is a great way to discover new wines with friends while pretending you’re at a gorgeous vineyard in Napa (instead of the same house you’ve been in for eight months!). A little festive escapism is just what we need in 2020, right?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. A holiday playlist</h2>



<p>Nothing gets us into the spirit quite like holiday music. Curate a memorable playlist by asking your family and friends to add their all-time favorite holiday song to the list. Pour yourself a wine and have a singalong!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. <strong>Get crafty with &#8216;Thank You&#8217; cards</strong></h2>



<p>A great Christmas Day activity is to get crafty! Pull out some scrapbooking supplies and sit down for an art project and an opportunity to express gratitude to the ones you love &#8211; and yourself!</p>

<p>The holidays are going to look a bit different this year, but that doesn’t mean we have to miss out on some of the season’s most festive activities. It’s really about spreading cheer, and helping others less fortunate than you are is a great way to demonstrate that. Your efforts may mean more than you know.</p>



<p>In fact, this year is a great opportunity to create new holiday traditions that are fun, safe and memorable.</p>
