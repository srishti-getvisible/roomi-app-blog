<p>As a tenant, finding out that your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/complete-guide-to-rent-payment-plans/">rent</a> is being hiked can be daunting. Rent increases are becoming very common, especially in high-demand cities. The a<a href="https://www.millionacres.com/real-estate-investing/rental-properties/what-average-rent-increase-year/">nnual average rent increase</a> is between 3%-5%, which is something you might face once it&#8217;s time for your lease renewal. The good news is that you don&#8217;t have to keep silent; you can negotiate a rent increase with your landlord. This will help you reduce the financial strain on you and your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/a-basic-guide-on-living-with-roommates-in-la/">roommate</a>, by keeping your rent stable. If you don&#8217;t know where to start, don’t stress! Roomi&#8217;s here to help. Here are some tips to help you get through a rent increase negotiation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-should-you-negotiate">Why should you negotiate?</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>It means more money for you. Say both you and your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-for-co-living-with-the-opposite-sex/">flatmate(s)</a> bargain $50 off your rent each month, that’s $600 saved each year per person! Rent negotiation will help you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/money-saving-and-financial-tips-for-young-adults/">save money</a> for other needs and rainy days.</li><li>If done right, it can boost the landlord-tenant relationship. Your landlord is human too, and how well you appeal for a rent reduction could improve your relationship.</li><li>Personal reasons: You may have developed a love for your apartment, and even your flatmates. Maybe you work close to your apartment and you’ve perfected your lifestyle. This may make you reluctant to leave and is a solid reason for you to negotiate.</li></ul>

	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-research-is-key">1. <strong>Research is key</strong></h3>



<p>Start by checking the market prices of similar apartments in your area, and find your apartment’s actual worth. If your landlord is trying to charge more than the market rate, then you’ll need to negotiate. You don’t want to pay more for a rental that other tenants enjoy at a lower price.</p>



<p>Part of your research should include talking to other tenants around the area. Find out how much they pay for a similar apartment and compare. If they pay less, you can negotiate a rent increase with your landlord, especially during lease renewal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-state-your-case-properly">2. <strong>State your case properly</strong></h3>



<p>Let your landlord know why you want to negotiate. Be as authentic as possible, and lay out the facts about your situation. Let them know how an increased rent would negatively impact you or your roommate(s). When you’ve done your research and understand more about the apartment’s rental value, it becomes easier to state your case. Preparation is key!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-bargain-for-upgrades">3. <strong>Bargain for upgrades</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re facing a rent increase that you can’t get out of, you can ask for an upgrade in your apartment. You may be willing to pay more to have an important upgrade or repair done. Don’t bring up a long list of improvements, but asking for one or two upgrades that reflect the new price is usually fair.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-make-enticing-offers">4. <strong>Make enticing offers</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l3V0GEwekqtkf5mWk" title="offer"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>When trying to get out of a landlord increased rent, you can try making a compromise. Think about what your landlord might want in return to make an offer they can’t refuse. Here are some things to try:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If you can see yourself staying in that apartment for a while, offer to renew your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi/">lease</a> when it expires.</li><li>Offer to pay rent a couple of months ahead in exchange for a rent reduction.</li><li>Offer to do something that raises the value of the property, like repainting the walls.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-state-how-good-you-ve-been-as-a-tenant">5. <strong>State how good you’ve been as a tenant</strong></h3>



<p>If you and your roommate(s) have a great tenant track record, use it to your advantage. &nbsp;Bring up how you pay rent early, or how well you’ve taken care of the apartment. Landlords appreciate tenants who are non-disruptive, so remind them how trouble-free you’ve been and how you plan to continue in that way.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-learn-how-much-the-landlord-can-legally-increase-rent">6. <strong>Learn how much the landlord can legally increase rent</strong></h3>



<p>Get familiar with local and state laws about rent increase and lease renewal processes. Go over your current lease again, and check whether it mentions rent increase rates. This will help you go into rent negotiations being both well prepared and well informed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-timing-matters">7. <strong>Timing matters</strong></h3>



<p>Choose your timing well when it comes to rent increase negotiations. It&#8217;s advisable to negotiate rent during these times:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A few months before your lease expires &#8211; you can ask for a lease renewal in exchange for reduced rent.</li><li>During winter. Winter is a slow period for landlords since people move more during warmer months. They may be more willing to consider your case if they can&#8217;t find new tenants.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-be-calm">8. <strong>Be calm</strong></h3>



<p>Remember that your landlord probably has reasons for a rent increase. Being rude or lashing out while trying to negotiate won’t play out well for you. You have to be calm, patient, and respectful, so you don’t risk causing an even larger divide between you and your landlord.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-put-the-deal-in-writing">9. <strong>Put the deal in writing</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:105%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/VFYJXIuuFl6pO" title="writing"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Deals put down in writing have more value, and can’t be easily broken. If your rent negotiations turn out successful, it doesn’t hurt to have it in writing &#8211; signed by both you and your landlord. It may be in your lease renewal document or additional paperwork. Wherever it is, it’ll help you avoid legal issues down the line.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-if-you-don-t-want-to-talk-directly-you-can-write-a-hardship-letter">10. If you don’t want to talk directly, you can write a hardship letter</h3>



<p>Another alternative you can try is writing a hardship letter. With this letter, you can explain your financial situation and the burden a rent increase would cause for you and/or your roommate(s). Write the letter as though you&#8217;re in a real conversation, and properly state your case. You can even use some of the tips above, like mentioning that you&#8217;re a good tenant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-do-when-rent-increase-negotiations-fail">What to do when Rent Increase Negotiations fail?</h2>



<p>If your negotiations don’t work, and you can’t afford to stay in the apartment anymore, then it may be time to find a new apartment. There’s a lot to consider when searching for a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/hacks-to-help-you-find-the-perfect-apartment-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">new apartment</a>, but Roomi can help find the perfect choice for you!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Renting after an eviction is not the easiest thing in the world. Though it is stressful, you can get through it with the right direction. It is important to embrace the situation and know that you are not alone. As a matter of fact, evictions are quite common, especially in the US.</p>



<p>Matthew Desmond, Professor in the Department of Sociology at Princeton University and author of the book <em>Evicted</em>, estimates that there are roughly <a href="https://en.as.com/en/2021/08/06/latest_news/1628249054_768663.html">one million evictions</a> in a typical year in the US.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has put more US renters at risk than ever before. Due to the pandemic, making rent got harder, leading to stimulus plans to supplement income and legislation that prevents evictions.</p>



<p>Now with things getting better, laws preventing evictions are being struck down, causing an unprecedented rise in evictions.</p>



<p>Regardless of the reason behind the eviction, it’s important to know what steps to take to be able to qualify for your next apartment.</p>



<p>In this blog, we will discuss how to get an apartment with an eviction on your record.</p>



<p>But before we dive into that, let’s dive deeper into how COVID-19 has affected evictions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="evictions-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Evictions During the Coronavirus Outbreak</h2>



<p>COVID-19 hit the economy in ways that no one could have predicted. This is why many states and cities implemented eviction moratoriums for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 Eviction Moratorium is a temporary rule that limits the amount of rent increases that landlords can give their tenants after a tenant has been evicted. The law is designed to help tenants who have been evicted from their homes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="660" height="441" data-attachment-id="18959" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-approval-renting-after-eviction/attachment/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?fit=660%2C441&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="660,441" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?fit=660%2C441&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?resize=660%2C441&#038;ssl=1" alt="evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak" class="wp-image-18959" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?w=660&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure></div>



<p>It requires landlords to provide a COVID-19 Notice to a tenant before applying for a rent increase. The law also requires landlords to wait at least 30 days before applying for a rent increase after giving a COVID-19 Notice.</p>



<p>With the eviction moratoriums coming to an end post-pandemic, evictions are rising in the US at a greater pace than ever before. And hence, more people are faced with the situation of renting an apartment after an eviction.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="guide-to-renting-after-an-eviction">Guide to Renting After an Eviction</h2>



<p>Whether it&#8217;s eviction due to financial reasons, ending of the COVID moratorium, or breaking rules in your old home, here’s how to get an apartment again.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-1-talk-to-your-previous-landlord">Step #1 &#8211; Talk to your previous landlord.</h3>



<p>Renting after an eviction will be much easier if you make amends with your previous landlord. Whatever the reason for eviction was, there are ways to fix it. Before you start going through apartment listings, ask your landlord if they can remove the eviction from your rental history. They might agree to help you out if you find a proper way to settle the dispute.</p>

<p>From a landlord’s perspective, the biggest concern is getting paid at the end of the month. So, to ease your landlord&#8217;s mind, always have a clean credit report. This is especially important if you are renting after an eviction. Evictions and failing to pay debt can lower your credit score by hundreds of points. A good credit score is 670 and above. Start rebuilding your credit score by paying your bills on time and in full. You’ll also want to be conscious of your spending.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-3-prepare-good-references">Step #3: Prepare good references.</h3>



<p>Because you&#8217;re renting after an eviction, you’ll need to take a few extra steps to prove to your next landlord that you’re going to be a reliable tenant. Solid references can help you get a job; they can also help you rent an apartment following an eviction. Previous landlords or past employers are good sources for referrals that can demonstrate you’re a responsible, trustworthy person.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-4-seek-a-co-signer">Step #4: Seek a co-signer.</h3>



<p>If someone you know has a good rental and credit history, you might be able to persuade them to co-sign your lease for a new apartment. Of course, the co-signer will have to cover the rent if you’re unable to do so. Be careful with this! If the co-signer isn’t able to make rental payments, you could wind up evicted again.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-5-look-for-apartments-with-eviction-forgiveness">Step #5: Look for apartments with eviction forgiveness.</h3>



<p>A great way for renting after an eviction is to narrow your search to those that are eviction-friendly. These apartments might have landlords that don’t run or require credit or eviction checks. These landlords are often local to the area and smaller in scale, with a couple of private units rather than a large apartment corporation.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-6-be-honest">Step #6: Be honest.</h3>



<p>Finally, it is important for you to be honest and answer all questions. In some cases, a landlord may be willing to overlook an eviction on a potential renter’s history if the renter is honest about what happened. For example, if you were in a difficult situation, such as job loss or a divorce, the landlord may be more understanding as to why you weren’t able to pay your rent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The world is opening up and the real estate market is bouncing back to its pre-pandemic ways. Life in the Big Apple is not cheap. Now with the implementation of a new rule, it might seem impossible to rent an apartment in the city. If you&#8217;re moving to NYC, or are already a seasoned renter, let&#8217;s explore what the 40x rent rule means, and how you can get around it. In this guide, we&#8217;ll answer your burning questions about the requirements to rent an apartment in NYC. <strong>There&#8217;s still hope! We&#8217;ve made a list of the 6 ways you can lock down an apartment even if you don&#8217;t meet the criteria of the 40x rent rule in NYC.</strong> Let&#8217;s dive in!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-the-40x-rent-rule-in-nyc">What is the 40x Rent Rule in NYC?</h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/realestate/so-your-rent-is-about-to-spike-can-you-avoid-paying-more.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">NY Times</a>, the median rent in Manhattan has bounced back to just above $3,000. This means New Yorkers should make more than $120,000 per year to afford this price. This figure is 40 times the median monthly rent. Additionally, you and your roommates (if you have them), must maintain good credit to secure the apartment of your dreams.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-s-the-problem-with-40-times-rent">What&#8217;s the Problem with 40 Times Rent?</h3>



<p>New Yorkers simply don&#8217;t make as much money as they need to be approved to rent certain homes. Let&#8217;s take a quick look at the statistics related to the 40x rent rule in NYC:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> suggests that an average, full-time employee earns approximately $51,480 per year.</li><li>This means that their monthly income is about $4,200 per month.</li><li>So, if $3,000 goes towards the monthly rent payments, New Yorkers only have a a little over $1,000 left. This amount doesn&#8217;t account for utilities and personal expenses, pet care, among others.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-ways-to-get-around-the-40x-rule-rent-in-nyc">6 Ways to Get Around the 40x Rule Rent in NYC</h2>



<p>Did you know that New York City&#8217;s housing expenses are <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Location=New-York-NY/Salary" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">369% higher</a> than the national average? <strong>So, how can you rent an apartment if you don&#8217;t meet the rule of 40 times rent?</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-tis-the-season-for-moving-to-nyc">1. &#8216;Tis the Season for Moving to NYC</h3>



<p>Are you thinking of moving to NYC? Traditionally, winter is a slow time for rentals. The city experiences a high volume of apartment shoppers in the summers, for example, international students living off-campus.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Therefore, in the winters, landlords might be more open to renting to you if you are just below the income threshold.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-look-for-roommate-s">2. Look for Roommate(s)</h3>



<p>The more people there are on your apartment lease, the lesser you&#8217;ll pay in monthly rent payments individually. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean that you should rent a 1-bedroom apartment and have ten roommates.</p>



<p>Depending on the layout of apartments, three or four tenants might consider renting a two-bedroom to split the high rent. In the case where two out of the four renters have good financials, they could be leaseholders. Then, a roommate agreement can be drawn up amongst the tenants explicitly stating who is responsible for what expense.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-tighten-up-your-credit-score">3. Tighten Up your Credit Score</h3>



<p>Landlords have different criteria when it comes to credit scores. Most are looking for a number around 700. However, they might be willing to look beyond the score if the apartments need to be filled.</p>



<p><strong>How to improve your credit to get around the 40x rent rule in NYC:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The most obvious way to improve your credit score is by paying existing debts. This is especially important for renters who have exceeded 15%-30% of their available credit.</li><li>If you have errors on your credit report, make sure they are corrected. Furthermore, you might want to consider getting letters of explanation for any major issues like bankruptcy.</li><li>Finally, If you don’t have a credit history, open some credit cards and start making regular, on-time payments.</li></ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-search-for-an-accommodating-landlord">4. Search for an Accommodating Landlord</h3>



<p>Searching for a flexible landlord is incredibly important if you don&#8217;t meet the requirements of the 40x rent rule in NYC. You might be able to negotiate with small landlords or condo owners because they aren&#8217;t large real-estate corporations. You can often negotiate rental terms and conditions with smaller landlords one-on-one. Not only that, but they might even be able to provide a co-signer if necessary!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-explore-co-living-spaces-in-nyc">6. Explore Co-Living Spaces in NYC</h3>



<p>Co-living spaces are essentially &#8220;adult dorms&#8221;. While this proposition might not be tempting at first, it&#8217;s a neat way to get around the 40x rule rent in NYC. Regardless, there are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-perks-of-co-living-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">upsides to exploring co-living alternatives!</a> These dorms offer the convenience of a furnished apartment with staples in the pantry and pre-selected roommates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Some of us might be benefiting from the whole work from home situation due to coronavirus. But it can become a cause of great panic for some. From budget cuts to being out of a job, any scenario that affects your income ultimately affects your living situation. Especially when you think you can&#8217;t pay your rent and you don&#8217;t see any rental assistance in view.</p>



<p>If you can&#8217;t pay your rent, you might even fear eviction. And there&#8217;s a lot of doubt and panic that surrounds renters in this pandemic stricken era.</p>



<p>Some of us might be barely making it, and some of us might not be making it at all. Even if you&#8217;re actively looking out for another job, the job conversion might end up taking more time than we&#8217;d like.</p>



<p>Which brings us to a very crucial question. What to do if you can&#8217;t pay your rent due to coronavirus?</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve put in the research and have gathered some things you should do if you can&#8217;t pay your rent. One of the most important things that we&#8217;d like you to remember is NOT to lose hope.</p>



<p>Here are some things you should look into if can&#8217;t pay your rent. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Research your state&#8217;s eviction protection programs if you can&#8217;t pay your rent</h2>



<p>Things look grim with the CARES Act as a rental assistance. As it applies only to a few properties regarding rent, and the act itself expiring. But you need to know where your state is with regard to the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-coronavirus-has-impacted-rent-prices-in-u-s-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact on rent due to coronavirus</a>. Also whether you can get any aid if you can&#8217;t pay your rent. </p>



<p>Find out whether your state is renewing the ban on evictions or not. If your state is not doing anything to help and you fear financial delinquency, get in touch with a lawyer for free with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.lsc.gov/what-legal-aid/find-legal-aid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legal Aid</a>. Understand your rights and what course of action would be best for you if you&#8217;re unemployed and can&#8217;t pay your rent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Tell your landlord that you can&#8217;t pay your rent</h2>



<p>The best rental assistance for you would be if your landlord understands that you can&#8217;t pay your rent. And if they&#8217;re willing to make a compromise in terms of rent. </p>



<p>However, we&#8217;ve come across both types of landlords in the news. The ones who have foregone any rent from their renters until they manage to find a source of income. And those who are staying rigid when it comes to rent. Or even inflicting more unreasonable terms concerning any stimulus check or aid you might be receiving if you&#8217;re unemployed (if any).</p>



<p>While you should try your best to convince your landlord to agree, don&#8217;t give in to unreasonable demands.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Suggest restructuring rent payments till things get better</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;ve been a good renter and have always paid the rent on time, the chances are that your landlord will understand if you can&#8217;t pay your rent right now. Try speaking honestly with your landlord about your situation. Also inform them of how long you expect to take to get up back on your feet again.</p>



<p>After the conversation, if your landlord agrees to help you out, make sure you put it all on paper with signatures. Simply so there&#8217;s no chance of them retracting from their word in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Reach out to local aid when you can&#8217;t pay your rent</h2>



<p>Fortunately enough, some organizations are actively working to offer rental assistance if you can&#8217;t pay your rent, and face the risk of eviction or homelessness due to coronavirus. Reach out to your <a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/housing-and-homeless-assistance/homeless-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">state&#8217;s housing organizations </a>and<a href="https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> housing assistance</a> to take the help that you need. You can find out about the organizations<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-how-to-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> working to help and get help </a>for people (in terms of rent, food, and other necessities) most affected by the pandemic financially.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Apply for a loan</h2>



<p>If nothing works out, you can find out what<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/20/what-banks-are-doing-to-help-americans-affected-by-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> banks are doing to help citizens affected by the coronavirus pandemic</a>. Leverage the rental assistance plans on offer and take out a loan while you hustle to get a viable source of income. Don&#8217;t worry about an increase in debts if a much more significant concern for you is that you can&#8217;t pay your rent. Remember to take one step at a time to solve your problems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Take in more roomis or move out</h2>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">List your room</a> to find another roomi. Even though you might end up being cramped for space, you&#8217;ll be helping yourself and others. If your landlord isn&#8217;t onboard, tell them that you can&#8217;t pay your rent alone and make them understand that this could be the only way you would be able to manage.</p>



<p>If you can&#8217;t afford your current place, find a cheaper room or bunk in with friends or family till things settle down.</p>



<p>And they will, soon enough.</p>

<p>Every landlord has good things to say about their property. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/a-first-time-renters-brilliant-guide-to-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you&#8217;re new to renting</a>, you might find it challenging to navigate through the criteria by which an apartment becomes desirable. With open queries (like what&#8217;s your late-fee policy? How is the water pressure? Can I sublet?) you can get to know more about the property and the landlord&#8217;s expectations. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a list of 20 questions compiled by Roomi that will help you gain more perspective on whether or not you should rent that gorgeous space you&#8217;ve been eying.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. When is the apartment available?</h2>



<p>Match your move-in date with the landlord&#8217;s start date. It&#8217;s challenging to find an apartment that ticks all the boxes, so if the move-in date does not match yours, see if you can have a conversation with your potential landlord to find a solution you&#8217;re both happy with.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Is there a rental deposit?</h2>



<p>Despite some state laws prohibiting the practice, many landlords go for non-refundable deposits and have them printed in the lease. It&#8217;s best to do your research and check the agreement thoroughly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. What is the lease duration?</h2>



<p>If the landlord wants a lease for two years and can only commit one year, no matter how perfect the apartment is, you need to move on and check other places. You do have an option of subletting – but consent from your landlord is essential here.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. How is the water pressure?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s important to check all taps in the kitchen and bathroom. Ask the landlord about the shower pressure and how long it takes for water to heat in the morning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. What are the amenities?</h2>



<p>This is one of the most important questions to ask before renting. Check if all amenities are in working condition, and document the &#8216;before&#8217; pictures of all the appliances provided. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-apartment-features-check-signing-lease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If there&#8217;s a gym or a pool in your apartment building</a>, check for timings and the policy on guest usage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. What is the room&#8217;s heating situation?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to check whether you have control over your room&#8217;s temperature regulation. Often, your landlord has the back-end control of the temperature. So, make sure you ask them if it&#8217;s possible for you to regulate the temperature.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. How is cell reception?</h2>



<p>Can you imagine yourself leaning out of your window trying to get a cell network or scurrying into a corner of the room for a better signal? And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a good idea to check for phone reception in your potential apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Who accepts the deliveries to the property?</h2>



<p>You may want all your parcels or UPS or FedEx deliveries taken by a supervisor or authorized person in the absence of a doorman. Ask if these options are available.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Is it noisy?</h2>



<p>Noise can be disruptive, especially if you are going to be working from home. Whether it&#8217;s<a href="https://noisefree.org/how-to-complain-about-apartment-noise-successfully/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> noisy neighbors</a>, loud music, or TV, it affects the quality of your lifestyle. Some landlords have a &#8216;quiet hour policy&#8217; included in the housing agreement. Check with your potential landlord if noise is something that could bother you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Who is responsible for managing common areas?</h2>



<p>Some landlords take the responsibility upon themselves to maintain common areas like the hallway, elevator, and porch. It is also common for some landlords to charge an annual or monthly maintenance fee. It&#8217;s best to know some of your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/five-common-questions-about-renters-rights-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rights as a renter</a> in your state to clarify this one, so ask the right questions to your landlord.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">11. What is the guest policy?</h2>



<p>In many areas, the landlord or the building manager needs to be informed if you&#8217;re having a long-term guest or visitor coming over. Do ask your landlord beforehand if you plan on having a guest over for more than a week to avoid sneaking around.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">12. Is there parking available?</h2>



<p>High-density areas have permit and license requirements for parking. With tightly cramped apartment blocks, it may be a challenge to park your car if you drive one. Ask your landlord if there&#8217;s a parking spot reserved for the building residents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">13. Are pets allowed?</h2>



<p>A necessary question before renting! If you own a pet, it is a good idea to check for pet policy with your landlord to avoid unnecessary fines later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">14. Can you sublet?</h2>



<p>What happens if your work requires you to travel for a few months, or what if you&#8217;re going away for a long trip? <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/is-it-legal-sublet-room-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subletting will help you pay rent for the months</a> where you&#8217;re personally not using the space. A fair request from the landlord&#8217;s end might be to adhere to his guidelines and meet his screening criteria, which seems like a fair deal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">15. What is the late-fee policy?</h2>



<p>Check with the landlord on the late-fee policy. Every state allows late fees within their guideline and state limit. It&#8217;s best to do your research on the late-fees policy to avoid paying a higher late fee.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">16. Mode of paying rent</h2>



<p>What methods for rental payments will the landlord accept? Online payment is an easy and convenient option. Also, avoid landlords who only insist on cash payments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">17. Termination</h2>



<p>Another important question to ask before renting! Does your landlord allow early lease termination? Some landlords may provide early termination of the lease, but might ask you to pay a fee for the months you signed up. Get clarity on this if you have uncertain plans for your stay in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">18. Lease renewal</h2>



<p>Can the lease be renewed? What if you want to go month-to-month after your lease expires? It helps to know the landlord’s perspective on this as some plan to sell the property, and you may not know their intention unless you ask them this question.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">19. Which furnishings or appliances are part of the rental lease?</h2>



<p>As a practice, some states require the renters to install their own devices, while in many others, the landlord installs them. For the latter, it might be a good idea to check the working condition of the appliances. You might also need to ask for an upgrade if required.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">20. Neighborhood safety</h2>



<p>Has there been a break-in, theft, or assault on this property? You may not get a direct answer to this question, but at least the landlord knows that you take safety seriously. You can check police or public records for accurate answers if you need to. It might not seem like it, but this is one of the most important questions to ask your landlord for your own safety.</p>

<p>Know your rights, tenants! So we&#8217;ve made a guide that provides answers to the five most common questions about renters&#8217; rights. This will include questions like &#8216;Can I deny entry to my landlord?&#8217; &#8216;Who is responsible for maintenance of common areas in my apartment?&#8217; and more! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are Renters&#8217; Rights?</h2>



<p>That is to say, renters&#8217; rights, they are local laws that govern your living space. It gives the tenants a legal recourse if the landlord fails to maintain their property.</p>



<p>So some common questions about renters&#8217; rights we&#8217;ll be covering are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Can I deny entry to my landlord?</li><li>What to do if your landlord won&#8217;t fix anything in your apartment?</li><li>Can a landlord kick you out?</li><li>Who is accountable for the maintenance of common areas in my apartment building?</li><li>Is my landlord harassing me?</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Common question about renters&#8217; rights: Can I deny entry to my landlord?</h2>



<p>To answer one of the most common questions about renters&#8217; rights: Yes, a tenant can deny entry to a landlord based on <a href="https://www.justia.com/real-estate/landlord-tenant/information-for-tenants/tenants-right-to-privacy/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">their right to&nbsp;privacy.</a></p>



<p>For common repairs and house improvements or to show the apartment to a prospective tenant or purchaser, the landlord needs to give the tenant a 24-hour notice period and arrive at a reasonable time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are there any exceptions?</h3>



<p>If an emergency strikes that requires the landlord to be present, e.g. if a tenant has abandoned the property or there&#8217;s a police investigation for a reported crime, the landlord has the right to enter the property. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Common question about renters&#8217; rights: Can my landlord refuse to fix anything in my apartment?</h2>



<p>A tenant has a fundamental right to a comfortable home, regardless of what&#8217;s written in your lease! So to answer a common question about renters&#8217; rights: The landlord must <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-deal-with-apartment-damages-before-moving-out/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintain your unit during your tenancy. </a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So what should I do if my landlord does refuse?</h3>



<p>Additionally, the tenant has a lot of options available if the landlord is refusing to make major repairs. Options include alerting a housing inspector if the problem violates building code.</p>



<p>In many states you can withhold your rent until repairs are made. As a tenant, you can also deduct the cost from your monthly rent with consent from the landlord. Moreover, you can even go to the small claims court and sue your landlord; you may be able to get your rent reduced.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Who is accountable for the maintenance of common areas in my apartment building?</h2>



<p>To answer this common question about renters&#8217; rights: Landlords are responsible for maintaining common areas as mandated by state law. When you talk about maintenance of common areas in your apartment, it implies that cleanliness and safety are taken care of. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What if my landlord isn&#8217;t complying?</h3>



<p>However, if your landlord is not addressing these issues or is unresponsive, you can get assistance by contacting the local government office based on the violation of health codes, safety codes and/or failing to maintain housing standards.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Common question about renters&#8217; rights: Can my landlord kick me out?</h2>



<p>To answer this common question about renters&#8217; rights: It is illegal for the landlord to change the locks or throw out your belongings. A landlord cannot just kick you out. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can I get help if my landlord tries to kick me out?</h3>



<p>Additionally, they need to follow a formal process of eviction that the state provides. You can sue the landlord if they force you out of the apartment. You can also get compensation for damage to your belongings and other related losses.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. How do I approach the problem of my landlord harassing me?</h2>



<p>Harassment from landlords can be quite a nerve-wracking experience. It can lead to worrying about your mental health and safety. And obvious forms of harassment include violating your right to privacy by showing up unannounced or at odd hours. Harassment also includes spreading false information and defamation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So when should I inform the authorities?</h3>



<p>To answer this common question about renters&#8217; rights: A landlord cannot disrupt your work environment by spreading false information about you to your co-workers or employers. Some landlords even break the law by spying, assaulting, or sexually assaulting their tenants. If you have experienced this extreme form of harassment, you should get the police involved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You don’t need “Game of Thrones” to tell you this, but winter is indeed coming. And that means those hot showers are about to become that much more important to get you through the days. Whether you’re in <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a> or San Francisco, a&nbsp;one-bedroom apartment in the heart of either city can easily cost over <a href="http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&amp;city1=New+York%2C+NY&amp;country2=United+States&amp;city2=San+Francisco%2C+CA" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3,000 a month</a>. And when you’re paying an arm and a leg to <i>rent</i> your home, it’s that much more important that you get your money’s worth. Having hot water is a fundamental right due to renters by their landlords, so if your taps are running cold, it’s important to speak up. But if you&#8217;re going to confront your landlord, it&#8217;s important to be aware of tenants&#8217; rights. So what do you do if a landlord isn’t providing the essentials, like hot water? What are your rights as a tenant under law?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-your-landlord-have-to-provide-hot-water">Does Your Landlord Have to Provide Hot Water?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tenants-rights-in-new-york-city">Tenants&#8217; rights in New York City</h3>



<p>In New York City, every landlord is required to&nbsp;provide adequate heat and hot water between Oct. 1 and May 31 (also known as the “Heat Season”), <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/important-safety-issues-heat-hot-water.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to NYC 311</a>. Hot water, however, <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/important-safety-issues-heat-hot-water.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">should be provided 365 days a year</a> and should be at least 120°. If you’re without either or both, you can report it to the City. Renters are also allowed to&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-things-to-do-if-you-cant-make-rent-roomi/">withhold rent</a> for such a grievance, according to Brooklyn-based <a href="http://streeteasy.com/blog/nyc-renters-rights-heat-hot-water/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">housing rights attorney Justin La Mort</a>. But don&#8217;t make that your first plant of action. NYC 311 recommends first contacting your landlord, managing agent or super to resolve the issue (remember to&nbsp;keep track of all written correspondence). If it still goes unresolved within a reasonable amount of time, let the City intervene on your behalf, recommends NYC realtor Collin Bond.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“If a tenant does not have hot water they should call 311 to file a complaint. This will trigger an investigation by the HPD (Housing Preservation &amp; Development). HPD will follow up with the owner or management company and the tenant to see if service has been restored.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If hot water <i>still</i> isn’t restored, your landlord could be subject to some serious fines.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The penalty for not providing hot water is $250 to $500 per day for each initial violation,” adds Bond, “and $500 to $1,000 for each subsequent violation at the same building during the same or next calendar year from the initial violation.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If the&nbsp;situation forces you out of your apartment (because cold showers in 15° weather is not OK), you still shouldn’t try to withhold rent. If you incur expenses because of the situation (i.e. you’re displaced and have to go to a hotel, etc.) make sure to keep all receipts, pay your rent, and seek legal counsel. Taking your landlord to court isn’t the ideal situation, but it is your right if push comes to shove. To learn about all your rights as a tenant under law, visit the <a href="http://metcouncilonhousing.org/help_and_answers/statutory_rights_of_residential_tenants_in_new_york">Metropolitan Council on Housing</a>&nbsp;website.  </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tenants-rights-in-san-francisco">Tenants&#8217; rights in San Francisco</h3>



<p>Like NYC, San Francisco law requires that a landlord provide hot water to their tenants, as apart of their responsibility to maintain “habitability” of their residences. Heat should be available and maintained at 68° between 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. or 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Hot water should always be available and maintained at a temperature of 105° to 120°, according to SF311.&nbsp;If you’re without hot water in San Francisco, you can technically withhold rent. But just like in NYC, you should never resort to this first. Going on a rent strike could put you a at risk of an eviction for not paying.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“If you use this option, the landlord may fix the problem or attempt to evict you for nonpayment of rent and you will have to go to court and adequately prove the seriousness of the problem and the landlord’s failure to do anything about it,” says the San Francisco Tenants Union website.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Instead, report the issue to your landlord and document the correspondence. If your landlord doesn’t fix your hot water in a timely manner, you should contact the<a href="http://sfdbi.org/"> Department of Building Inspection</a>. Expect the city to inspect within one business day. Continue documenting every correspondence, and ask for a copy of the report for your records. But be careful if you live in an illegal <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/nyc-landlords-never-empty-apartment/">apartment</a>. The DBI could shut down the apartment building altogether. That would lead to an automatic eviction. </p>



<p>If you can show the landlord knew of the issues and did not repair them in a timely manner, you can repair the damage yourself and deduct what you spent from your rent. But again, you risk an eviction notice based on nonpayment of rent, and you could end up in court. Therefore, it’s not advised to do this, and you may be better off pursuing legal action. Ultimately, it’s never a good idea to withhold rent until you’ve spoken to a lawyer. Organizations like the San Francisco Tenants Union, Housing Rights Committee of SF and SF311 are great resources for more information and counsel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tenant-law-in-other-cities">Tenant law in other cities</h3>



<p>Don’t live in NYC or SF? Your landlord still has to provide you hot water. Find your city’s tenants&#8217; rights or housing authority website to learn what the laws are. You have rights as a tenant under law to live in a habitable environment . That means your landlord must do their part to provide it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>San Francisco renters can breathe a sigh of relief: The <a href="http://www.cjjc.org/en/our-work/housing-rights-campaign/637-what-is-eviction-protections-2-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eviction Protections 2.0 bill</a>&nbsp;passed into law on Oct. 9, 2015, hopefully putting an end to the rise in the city’s no-fault evictions. Advocated by lead author and <a href="http://sfbos.org/index.aspx?page=11324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">District 6 Supervisor, Jane Kim</a>, E.P. 2.0 is one landmark legislation that will change the grounds on which a lawful eviction can occur. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about renters protection in San Francisco!</p>



<p>In a city suffering from an all-out housing crisis, E.P. 2.0 has been a hot topic since it was first proposed — and for good reason why. Here’s what to know about the eviction laws in San Francisco and what this important new housing law, in particular, means for San Francisco renters.</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/renters-rights-landlord-provide-hot-water/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Tenants’ Rights: Does My Landlord Have to Provide Hot Water?</strong></a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the San Francisco Housing Crisis?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1617048551602-f377d4174089?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8OXx8cmVudHxlbnwwfHwwfHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="renters protection in san francisco is now updated"/></figure>



<p>So, why was this legislation being pushed, and why did it have so many supporters? In a nutshell: Affordable housing is nearly impossible to find. According to the San Francisco Department of Planning’s Housing Balance Report from July 2015, the city added 6,559 affordable housing units between 2004 and 2014 but lost 5,470 rent-controlled apartments due to a variety of no-fault evictions. In the&nbsp;last five years, eviction notices have <a href="http://www.cjjc.org/en/our-work/housing-rights-campaign/637-what-is-eviction-protections-2-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased by a startling 67 percent</a>, according to the Rent Board’s annual reports on evictions to the Board of Supervisors. Nearly 83 percent of those were no-fault evictions (an eviction that results from <a href="http://www.smgov.net/Departments/Rent_Control/Information_and_FAQ/Newsletters/60-Day_Notice_for_No-Fault_Evictions_Now_Permanent.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">nothing the tenant has</a>&nbsp;or hasn’t done), according to Supervisor Kim.</p>



<p>That significant rise has a lot to do with the spike in market rent in recent years, which means “many tenants face high rent burdens, which have increased rapidly in recent years,” according to “<a href="http://sfcontroller.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=6574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Obligation Bond for Affordable Housing: Economic Impact Report</a>” by the&nbsp;Controller’s Office of Economic Analysis. The result:&nbsp;sky-high rent and a threat to the function of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/what-to-know-about-san-francisco-rent-control-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">San Francisco’s rent-control laws</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“When [other] one-bedrooms [are] going for over $3,000…there’s a lot of incentive for landlords to evict,” says Kim. “They’re doing it to evict tenants who are under rent-control, and then when they evict them, they can raise the rent market.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Because many property owners are forcing evictions by taking their properties off the market or hiking up rent prices, new affordable housing is lagging to catch up. That contributes hugely to the crisis, says Kim, and EP 2.0 is the solution.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are the&nbsp;Eviction Laws in San Francisco?</h2>



<p>E.P. 2.0 includes a number of new protections that will prevent landlords from unfairly evicting tenants through various tactics. Here are the basics of what it covers:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sham Evictions</h3>



<p>Before this bill passed, eviction laws in San Francisco allowed landlords to evict tenants for some pretty petty stuff — things like hanging laundry, leaving a stroller in the hallway, or painting a bedroom. EP 2.0 and its campaigners refer to these as “gotcha evictions,” and the new law now requires landlords to provide a “meaningful opportunity” to resolve disputes before issuing an eviction notice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Roommate Restrictions</h3>



<p>The bill also creates solid restrictions on additional roommates with the housing crisis in mind. Again, landlords could previously set arbitrary restrictions on roommates and could use new roommates as grounds for a no-fault eviction.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“You can deny [roommates] if you have reasonable discretion to deny,” says Kim of the amendment. “But you can’t deny based on a number maximum.”</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Rent Limitations</h3>



<p>E.P. 2.0 sets rent limitations to protect the affordability of rent-controlled apartments and requires landlords to set base rent for the next five years as “the lawful rent&nbsp;in effect at the time of the vacancy in certain situations such as an Owner-Move-In eviction.” That means landlords who issue a no-fault eviction cannot increase rent on the apartment for five years.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The country is looking at San Francisco to set the stage for solutions to these regional and national issues,” said Maria Zamudio, Executive Director of Causa Justa::Just Cause, one of the lead advocates for EP 2.0.</p><p>“The Mission district is ground zero for the displacement of thousands of San Franciscans due to the rapidly growing inequality in our City. But today, we celebrate because the advocacy and tenacity of the tenant community has resulted in the passage of one of the strongest tenant’s rights laws in the state. Today, the people won.”</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Language Barriers</h3>



<p>Finally, in acknowledgement the city’s ethnic diversity, EP 2.0 requires the Rent Board to prepare a form in English, Chinese, Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog and Russian stating that an eviction notice may&nbsp;lead to a lawsuit to evict and stating that advice regarding notices to vacate is available from the Rent Board. Additionally, landlords must attach a copy of the eviction notice in the primary language of the tenant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Should You Care About Renters Protection In San Francisco?</h2>



<p>So, say you don’t leave strollers in the hallway, you speak English, and you and your roommate don’t have any plans to add another — you should still care about E.P. 2.0. The scary thing about no-fault evictions is that your landlord could claim anything is reason enough to evict you. And while most of San Francisco’s housing is rent-controlled, the laws allow landlords to raise rent to market rate once an apartment vacates — meaning your chances of finding affordable housing are pretty bleak. So, ultimately, knowing your rights and your landlord’s rights could mean the difference between moving and staying put lawfully.</p>



<p>This bill is just a stepping stone towards more affordable housing in SF and a very comprehensive stepping stone. Kim says she will and always has been focusing on the production and acquisition of affordable housing.</p>



<p>Renters protection in SF is finally letting us all breathe a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>As a renter, having a good relationship with your landlord is as important as having a good relationship with your roommate. Especially when money is involved. The least you can do to be safe is find a trustworthy roommate by vetting candidates on platforms that let you find <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compatible roommates</a> for free. But what about landlords? When paying rent, you want to make sure the person you’re&nbsp;doing business with is trustworthy as well. That’s why it’s your right as a tenant to request a rent&nbsp;payment receipt from your landlord to prove you’ve paid your rent. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>In some cases, it’s mandatory they give you one.&nbsp;Even if your landlord is a reputable businessperson, it’s simply good sense to have a record of your financial transactions. Just like with anything else you pay for. Luckily online payments and credit cards have made record-keeping a lot easier. However, if you pay rent with cash or personal check, you’ll need to make sure your landlord provides you with a rent payment receipt. No matter how you pay, here are three reasons why you should always get a rent receipt from your landlord.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-to-protect-yourself-against-nbsp-bad-landlords">1. To Protect Yourself Against&nbsp;Bad Landlords</h3>



<p>We know there are plenty of&nbsp;great landlords out there, but occasionally you’ll come across a bad apple. And more problematically,&nbsp;you might not find this out until it’s too late. It&#8217;s important to request a rent payment receipt from the beginning of your relationship with a new landlord. This not only lets them know you have good business sense, but it also protects you from wrongful accusations of late or unpaid rent. Moreover, it would ultimately save a lot of money, should the issue escalate.</p>

All of which the landlord deducted from the tenant’s security deposit.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, the tenant had no proof of making timely payments. And didn’t want to undertake the risk and burden of taking the landlord to court over the security deposit deductions, so she just let it be.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-not-having-a-rent-payment-receipt-can-wreck-your-life">How not having a rent payment receipt can wreck your life</h3>



<p>Journalist and former TED Talk speaker <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/becky_blanton_the_year_i_was_homeless?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Becky Blanton</a>&nbsp;says she was cheated twice&nbsp;by landlords who claimed she didn’t pay rent. The first time she similarly made the mistake of not asking for a rent payment receipt, but even when she was more careful, she didn’t have the means to fight a bad landlord.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The first time I was living in student housing at the University of Tennessee. I always paid in cash and never got a rent receipt. I ended up being evicted when my landlord told me I hadn’t paid rent in three months. It was my word against the property manager, and I lost,” Blanton says.</p>



<p>“The same thing happened in Denver when I was homeless. I finally got an apartment, paid in money orders, and got my receipts this time. But the manager claimed I had never paid rent, kicked me out and sued me. I posted on several social media sites about it and found out that other people, mostly women and immigrants, had had similar experiences.</p>



<p>“The guy was signing my money orders and diverting money to his personal account, but I didn’t have the money to fight him and I was across the country at the time, so I lost the judgement.”</p>

<p>Rent history relies on a paper trail. So if your landlord decides to evict you for not paying rent (even though&nbsp;you did), and you could have proven otherwise with rent receipts (but you don’t have them). This can reflect badly on your rent history. And in cities with intense housing competition like New York and San Francisco, a shady rent history can ultimately cost you an apartment even if it’s not your fault.</p>



<p>Also, some states offer a “<a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/credits/real_property_tax_credit.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renters’ tax credit</a>” if you meet certain qualifications. And with other reasons notwithstanding, a rent history paper trail is essential when filing taxes, especially when using tax accounting software to track and manage deductions. Again, if you have no written proof that you paid for something, you could lose out on getting some money back because of a technicality.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-because-it-s-nbsp-better-to-be-safe-than-sorry">3. Because It’s&nbsp;Better to Be Safe Than Sorry</h3>



<p>The truth is that you never know when a rent payment receipt will come in handy. Even if your landlord seems trustworthy, there’s no harm in requesting a rent receipt. As it could be your saving grace in a sticky situation. If you can, pay your rent with a credit or debit card, so it shows up on your monthly statement. If your landlord offers a way to pay online, do this — but only if you can get an email rent receipt. Save these emails or print them out (or both). This way you’d be prepared if you need to give proof you paying rent.</p>



<p>Money orders are another option, as they inherently have a receipt attached. Make sure to fill the money order out completely, and take a picture. And if cash or check is your only option, ask for that receipt!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hear-it-from-people-who-ve-been-cheated">Hear it from people who&#8217;ve been cheated</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Always demand a rent receipt when you pay,” Blanton recommends. “Don’t let the manager tell you they’ll get it for you later. If they won’t give you a receipt when you pay, don’t pay until they can. This is how I got burned the first time…they promised to drop it off and never did”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Loving&nbsp;backs this up by saying certain state laws allow&nbsp;tenants to legally refuse rent payment until a receipt is produced. So, know your rights, and educate yourself on the local renters’ protections. (Here is what <a href="http://www.ccsroc.net/?page_id=467" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SF law</a> and NYC law say about rent receipts.) </p>

https://giphy.com/gifs/foxtv-fox-almost-family-almostfamily-Q6yeftAR1dBEGm3OXe
</div></figure>



<p>The same goes if only one roommate is responsible for paying the landlord. Sign a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://legaltemplates.net/form/roommate-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate contract</a> outlining the details of your agreement, and uphold your end of the bargain.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You’ve probably heard plenty of roommate horror stories, but the truth is that roommates aren’t always the ones you should be weary of. For some unlucky renters, it’s bad landlords that can make your life a living nightmare. Especially if your landlord changed the locks! So if you&#8217;re wondering &#8216;Can a landlord change the locks?,&#8217; you&#8217;ve come to the right place. Let&#8217;s decipher all about if a landlord decides to lock you out. </p>



<p>Of course, not every landlord will lock you out or is a bad guy. But to be a smart renter, you have to to do your research. Whether it’s asking for a rent receipt, making sure you have hot water, or fighting back a “shortcut” eviction, knowing your renters rights can ultimately protect you from a scheming landlord wanting to lock you out. So what are your rights if your landlord changed locks? You might think your landlord can lock you out, but here’s what you should know about illegal evictions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Expedited evictions or if your landlord locks you out, it is illegal (almost all the&nbsp;time)</h2>



<p>Generally&nbsp;landlords know that bypassing legal eviction procedures could result in far more trouble (and fines) than is worth the risk, so most won’t take drastic measures to kick you out. But on the off chance that your landlord changed the locks while you’re at work, you can fight back. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">First you should know that your landlord cannot legally force you to leave by:</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Changing the locks</li><li>Turning off the utilities</li><li>Removing a tenant’s&nbsp;belongings</li><li>Verbally threatening legal action but never producing legal documents</li><li>Verbally threatening physical harm</li></ol>



<p>These rules apply in <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/lock-out-tenant-illegal-29799.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtually every state</a>&nbsp;because a landlord/tenant relationship is a legal one, not a personal one. Just like signing a lease, evicting someone&nbsp;is a legal process, and is thus carried out through legal documents. Bottom line: If there’s no paperwork, your &#8216;landlord lock you out&#8217; scheme isn&#8217;t legal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How important is the law in cases like these?</h4>



<p>Here’s an example of how important legal intervention is in the eviction process. “Squatting” or adverse possession, is a process by which a tenant (whether or not he/she is a leaseholder) may receive the title to someone else’s property without the owner’s consent through prolonged, undisputed and obvious occupation. In New York, the occupant must live on the premises for an uninterrupted 10 years for this to happen.</p>



<p>If a squatter can prove they’ve maintained residence on a property for 30 days, they’re legally allowed to stay there until the true property owner goes through the extensive process of legally evicting them. So you find a strange man in your house after a month? You can’t just kick him out. (Sounds crazy, but it’s <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-landlord-remove-stranger-house-article-1.2066839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actually happened</a>.) If 10 years pass without legal action, the squatter becomes the sole proprietor of the property. The same rules <a href="http://homeguides.sfgate.com/squatters-rights-law-california-45887.html" class="broken_link">apply in San Francisco</a>, except the requirement for the length of occupancy is less stringent than in New York, requiring only a period of five years before the squatter becomes the owner of the property.</p>



<p>These laws just go to show that eviction is&nbsp;<em>not</em> that easy, even in the most bizarre scenarios. Check your city’s housing authority site to know exactly what the eviction process entails. So to answer your question about whether or not can a landlord change the locks, the brief answer is no. Not without the process in place at least. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is it ever legal for my landlord to lock me out?</h2>



<p>They aren’t. A truly legal eviction takes time. Your landlord can lock you for a breach of contract or for going against the agreements set out in your lease, but it’s a lengthy, highly litigated process. In New York, for instance, a to lock you out, the landlord will have to go to court to get&nbsp;a “Warrant of Eviction” even if you owe rent or your lease has ended. And it’s still not that easy to get one. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">First your landlord has&nbsp;to prove that you, the tenant:</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Have not paid rent</li><li>Have very obviously broken your lease terms</li><li>Don’t have an active lease&nbsp;and were given a 30-day warning</li></ol>



<p>In any of these cases, the landlord still has&nbsp;to give you 30 days to move out. So your landlord cannot lock you out, change the locks or turn off your utilities without notice.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Okay, so what are some laws a tenant should know about? </h2>



<p>San Francisco recently passed the&nbsp;Eviction Protections 2.0&nbsp;bill in an effort to put a stop to sham evictions that have seen a rise in recent years as rent prices have skyrocketed. Where once a landlord could claim an unattended bike in the hallway was grounds for eviction (even in this case the landlord would be required to give the tenant a reasonable amount of time to move), E.P. 2.0 ensures a tenant is given ample time to fix a problem before an immediate eviction notice.</p>



<p>The bill addresses other previous “grounds” for eviction, such as adding new protections for roommates, and tenants who cannot respond to legal documents because they’re written in a language they can’t read. There is also less incentive to attempt a sham eviction, as the new law sets rent limitations on potentially suspicious evictions, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellis Act</a> owner move-ins. In the event&nbsp;of a&nbsp;no-fault eviction, the landlord can’t raise the rent for five years, hopefully discouraging them from issuing&nbsp;evictions simply to raise the rent for future tenants.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why do shortcut evictions still happen then?</h2>



<p>So why do shortcut evictions still happen with a landlord changing the locks? Unfortunately, not all landlords and property owners are shaking in their boots at the thought of legal action because they rely on tenants’ inaction. In order to fight back, a&nbsp;tenant has to go to court to dispute the situation. Some tenants choose not to act because they fear legal fees. More often than not, the tenant simply feels intimidated or lacks knowledge of their local renters rights. They assume that it&#8217;s legal if a landlord changed the locks, removed belongings, or shut off utilities. Especially if you’re at fault, or have been in the past, for something&nbsp;like missing a payment or breaking the lease for some other reason, you might assume the landlord is within his or her rights.</p>



<p>Journalist Becky Blanton, who spoke on this matter during a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/becky_blanton_the_year_i_was_homeless?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TED Talk</a> in 2009, encourages tenants to realize that words aren’t as powerful as paper in the rental business.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Short term evictions <em>do</em>&nbsp;work if the tenant doesn’t know their rights, can’t afford an attorney, or won’t fight back,” she says. “Landlords count on this when they do it.</p><p>“But if you’re faced with a threat of a lawsuit, find an attorney or at the least do some research&nbsp;to learn what your rights are.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Blanton points out that apart from changing the locks, landlords will also threaten legal action. So they can get a tenant to flee the scene. But again, without paperwork, it’s not legal. So if a landlord changed locks and wants you to move out, it&#8217;s definitely illegal. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How should one fight back a landlord lock out?</h2>



<p>Dr. Jonathan Farley was living in Massachusetts when he ran into a situation with a landlady who had some very strict rules about who she would rent to. According to Dr. Farley, who was working as a professor at MIT at the time, she would only rent to academics, would not allow couples, and didn’t want children in the apartment even to visit. But while landlords can refuse to rent to a tenant for not meeting certain qualifications, they cannot set their own rules for eviction. Simply put, a landlord cannot lock you out on their own terms. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“She said that a tenant who had lived in the building for five years wouldn’t be allowed to stay because he just got married.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Dr. Farley also found her in his apartment without due notice or permission several times. A colleague warned him that the landlady might disappear around important deadlines. All to avoid updating legal documents or allowing for changes. “And the landlady was indeed unavailable until after the deadline,” he says. This forced him to pay rent for months summer where he worked overseas at Oxford University.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Alas, my brother (a lawyer) advised that I pay the rent anyway and try to get the money back later. I sued and won, but the judge only gave me $1,000 and I had paid more than that.”</p></blockquote>
