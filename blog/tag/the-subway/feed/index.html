<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>There are no actual rules to the New York City Transit System.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Yep, take our word for that one!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learn the stations you frequent</h2>

<p>At the end of a long commute, you just want to get the hell away from the subway. But it&#8217;s worth taking a second look around to familiarise yourself with the stations you visit frequently. This becomes crucial on the C and G lines as trains don&#8217;t always extend for the full length of the track.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just so rewarding to be able to calculate the train door closest to the exit, from the station you enter! This could make all the difference in your mood as well as your transit time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be very (very) mindful of what you eat (or drink).</h2>

<p>There may be train systems that don&#8217;t let you finish your bagel. But New Yorkers don&#8217;t stand by that kind of thinking. The cops will NOT be called on you if you decide to finish your coffee or sandwich mid-transit.</p>



<p>However, your odds of becoming a viral sensation increase, along with the olfactory intensity. So try to avoid chowing down on anything too strong in order to spare your fellow commuters. (This also goes for food that will make the subway messier than it already is.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep moving! <em>especially when you leave a station.</em></h2>

<p>This cannot be repeated enough. When you exit a station, walk some steps forward, <em>even if you don&#8217;t know where you are.</em></p>



<p>This will prevent you from coming in other people&#8217;s way. And also from people walking directly into your back. Or worse, causing a traffic jam of people, just because you stopped walking when you shouldn&#8217;t have.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like high school hallways, where getting your bearings is important, sure. But don’t jam up the works by not getting the hell out of the way, y&#8217;know?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Common-sense etiquette is expected.</h2>

<p>Remember, the subway is both cramped and responsible for accommodating a lot of people. So the best you can do is make the ride easier for yourself and those traveling next to you. Here are some basic subway etiquettes that we think every passenger must adhere to:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Stand to the side to let people off the trains</li><li>Avoid filling seats around you with your stuff or your smelly sense of entitlement</li><li>Walk all the way into the train instead of stopping six inches after walking through the doors.</li><li>No one likes that person who chooses to play their music on loud or to have a conversation on speaker. Sure, it makes for entertainment, but not at 7 am. </li><li>If you find yourself standing against the doors on a train that&#8217;s filled:<ul><li>Give space to those moving in and out when the doors are open.</li><li>If there&#8217;s space, move to the middle of the train.It&#8217;s as easy as that!</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to understand that just because you&#8217;re adhering to these rules, everyone else will too. The truth, as many exhausted New Yorkers will tell you, <strong>the subway has no rules beyond the New York City Criminal Code.</strong> But a little spatial awareness never hurt anyone.?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get a bike if nothing else works.</h2>



<p>Before you take us up on this, we&#8217;d like to say that <em>everything</em> is a little dangerous to a certain degree. There are even some coyotes running around like they own the place!</p>



<p>So <em>be careful</em> but don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that riding a bike is &#8220;too dangerous&#8221;. (Especially since the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjMnKLP9fPtAhU67HMBHT0xCZUQFjABegQIDhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F07%2F03%2Fnyregion%2Fcoronavirus-nyc-bike-paths.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw1saoQ3xoeIJr4HGsRn9wdS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">city continues to adopt a more bike-friendly infrastructur</a>e across the five boroughs!)</p>

<p>Commuting NYC, like a pro, is no big deal. Truly. Sure it seems intimidating at first, given the sheer vastness of the city. But don&#8217;t worry, We&#8217;ve got a guide on NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains to help you hop around the city in no time!</p>



<p>Any form of travel in New York has its own set of hitches. Our traffic is truly among the worst in the world. And it really isn&#8217;t getting better anytime soon.</p>



<p>Those who appreciate sanity often end up resorting to the mass transit in NYC, specifically, the subways and the busses.</p>



<p>Sure, pieces of the former may be falling from the ceiling, and speeds for the latter may be slowing. But if there&#8217;s anything NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains has going for itself is that it&#8217;s cheap, open 24/7, and covers all five boroughs. Yep, Staten Island included.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a visitor or not, you may want some advice on NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains. And we&#8217;re here to provide! Keep reading!</p>

<p>The first thing anyone will tell you about the subway is to plan ahead. Subway delays are a part of the New Yorker&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>All we want to let you know about this is &#8211; never trust anything Google Maps tells you about your ETA. Leave early, always. 15 mins, an hour? Whatever makes you comfortable to get somewhere, if reaching on time is key. Reaching early is always better than getting stuck on the subway — everyone dreads making that excuse.</p>

<p>In the year 2018, the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.mta.mymta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MTA finally released their app</a> — this app is meant to cover NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains, bus, and commuter rail services. You don&#8217;t just save your frequent trips and look for subway stops and bus stations near you. You also get updates on service and delays, and find an array of helpful maps for trains and busses!</p>



<p>Another alternative to this app is <a href="https://transitapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transit</a> — if at all your MTA beta app lags or is too chunky.</p>



<p>You might also need another <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mta.mobileapp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-Tix app</a> to purchase tickets virtually for the Long Island Rail Road. The MTA&#8217;s contactless payment system, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://omny.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OMNY</a>, doesn&#8217;t have its own app yet, but, you can use your digital wallet on your smartphone to very conveniently tap and go.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Metrocards: Unlimited or not unlimited?</h2>

<p>This one depends completely on your daily route. You might find that you&#8217;re more comfortable with an unlimited MetroCard, which comes in two variants:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>A 30-day MetroCard for $127</li><li>A 7-day for $33</li></ol>



<p>But before you decide on a solid option, give yourself time to understand what exactly your subway needs are like. You might just find that certain routes are easier if walked or biked!</p>



<p>You just might find that you can walk or bike everywhere (especially since a one-year Citi Bike membership is just $169). In this case, buy an occasional $40 MetroCard, or get a 7-day card if you’re entertaining a visitor who you’ll be riding around with all week.</p>



<p>If you do decide to get an unlimited card, make sure to swipe it forward. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/can-i-get-swipe-can-we-get-trouble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More on this very curious subject here.</a></p>

<p>Imagine running to NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains when you know you&#8217;re late, hearing it pull in as you&#8217;re swiping your card. And then realizing you don&#8217;t have any remaining balance on your MetroCard. It&#8217;ll always work in your favor to pay attention to how much is left <em>when you&#8217;re swiping in.</em></p>



<p>The moment you&#8217;re under $2.75, just fill the card up again at the station when you exit. This will help you avoid finding yourself stuck behind a family of tourists. And then watch them trying to figure out the MetroCard system, as the train arrival time teases you into panic mode. ?</p>
