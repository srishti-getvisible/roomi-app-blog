<p>Generally, Cape Cod homes have a steep roof, shingled exterior, symmetrical façade, and large chimney in the middle. While these houses can have multiple floors, most residences are single-storied. Additionally, Cape Cod house style is notoriously free of any excessive decoration, making them versatile enough for a variety of homeowners.</p>



<p>Nowadays, Cape Cod house style falls into one of three categories: a full Cape, three-quarter Cape, and half Cape. While full Cape houses boast a picture-perfect symmetry that is commonly associated with the style, three-quarter and half Capes are smaller, not to mention their entryways and chimneys are slightly offset.</p>

<p>Cape Cod has many beautiful and pristine landscapes, so it’s an ideal setting if you like to explore off the beaten track. The weather is relatively warm for much of the year—well, warm by New England standards. This means you can spend more days outdoors, taking in the scenery.</p>



<p>There are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/travel/2018/05/30/cape-cod-hikes/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">hikes to be taken</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.capecodchamber.org/bike-paths" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bike trails to cycle</a>. If you’re feeling adventurous, go for a swim. While Atlantic cod aren’t as plentiful as they used to be on Cape Cod, there is still a variety of fish to catch. Buy or rent fishing gear and enjoy a peaceful afternoon out on the water.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.massaudubon.org/get-outdoors/wildlife-sanctuaries/wellfleet-bay/programs-classes-activities/kayaking-cape-cod" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Kayaking opportunities abound</a>, and kayak rental companies are spread out all over the Cape.</p>



<p>Sailing and boat trips are also available around the Cape, and if you’re lucky, you might even&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.capecodchamber.org/play/whale-seal-watching" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spot the occasional whale</a>.</p>
