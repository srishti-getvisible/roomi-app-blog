<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting to know Albuquerque</strong></h2>



<p>While the Breaking Bad characters were interested in the deserts for their own reasons, Albuquerque, being located in central New Mexico, has semi-desert terrain, mountains forested with juniper and pine, and eco regions, depending on where you&#8217;re located.</p>



<p>Back in around the 8th Century, what is now called Albuquerque, already had multi storey stone buildings called pueblos, and if you&#8217;re a history buff, there&#8217;s lots of history to keep you busy here! But the area keeps up with the modern day, too. The <a href="https://mashable.com/2014/02/18/bitcoin-vending-machine-albuquerque/#5O8vBlLUs8qt">first U.S. Bitcoin vending machine</a> was installed in an Albuquerque cigar shop.</p>



<p>Surrounded by Sandia mountains in the east and an extinct volcano on the west, nature surrounds the Duke city as much as its culture does. Now let&#8217;s get straight to what you should know about rooms for rent in Albuquerque and average rent in Albuquerque.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Finding rooms for rent in Albuquerque</strong></h2>



<p>The city is geographically divided into 4 quadrants, namely, North East (NE), North West (NW), South East (SE) &amp; South West (SW).</p>
