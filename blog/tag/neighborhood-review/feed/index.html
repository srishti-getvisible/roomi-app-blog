										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">Long Island City neighborhood in Queens is an industrial center no longer. It has evolved into an affordable place to enjoy a thriving arts scene and a waterfront park with some of the best views of Manhattan you’re going to get this side of a helicopter. Despite being crazy close to Manhattan, a mere 20 minutes, Long Island City feels a lot quieter than you might expect. Perfect for anyone looking to play hard in the city and sleep hard at home.</span> Here&#8217;s Roomi&#8217;s Long Island City neighborhood review. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enjoy the <b>thriving arts scene</b></strong></h2>



<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">Long Island City neighborhood in Queens is very active in the fine arts.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MoMa PS1 is, in fact, one of the largest and oldest non-profit contemporary arts centers not just in NYC, but in the entire country. If the idea of being one of the first to discover an emerging artist whose work stimulates discussion, ignites ideas and drives change, then you should be a regular visitor to MoMa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sunday sessions live performances let you experience firsthand real time performances from new and established artists. You can enjoy their latest musical performances, dances, speeches and more. And while MoMa encourages donations, the PS1 center is</span><a href="https://www.moma.org/visit/index" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">free for NYC residents</span></a> while you&#8217;re in the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Get the <b>best views of Manhattan</b> when you&#8217;re in the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens </strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want some of the absolute best views of the Manhattan skyline, day or night, then head on over to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gantry State Park from the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens. It’s a five minute ride from Manhattan. So getting to the park, or heading to the lively and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/living-in-nyc-affordable-neighborhoods-in-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exciting Manhattan</a> scene afterwards, are pretty easy. Gantry State Park is right on the waterfront. The views of the Manhattan skyline are totally unobstructed. The East River here is very peaceful, making it prime selfie-shot territory to send jealously-inducing pics to your friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have regular events and activities, including exercise classes and a 5K race if running and fitness is your thing. For something a little more cerebral, they have chess and checker matches along the waterfront for you to enjoy. The list of activities goes on and on, from Easter egg hunts to fishing to weddings.</span> So we give an absolute thumbs up for our Long Island City neighborhood review!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>There are plenty of <b>sweet choices for dating and socializing</b></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gantry State Park and the surrounding area are full of options for places to eat as well, in case you want to bring your date to a nice spot by the river. The</span><a href="http://riverviewny.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Riverview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is very classy but also quite friendly. Their bottomless brunch option is perfect if you’re active in the dating scene. For a more informal place to eat in a group with friends, head on over to the</span><a href="http://cornerbistrony.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Corner Bistro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has the kind of energetic vibe that is perfect for winding up your Friday night.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Long Island City neighborhood in Queens has an average monthly rent of $1,018 on Roomiapp.com. It offers affordable living incredibly close to Manhattan. This is the place to be if you want to enjoy the exciting social scene New York City is world famous for, but have a home base to return to where you can actually sleep.</span></p>

<p>Roomi&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood review is that it is an exciting place to live. It has a long, rich history behind it and a future of dynamic change in front of it. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/find-apartments-brooklyn/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Based out of Brooklyn</a>, the residents are proud of Bed-Stuy’s strong African-American culture</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">nd it boasts some of the most beautiful</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownstone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">brownstone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> architecture in all of New York City. A</span>dditionally, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he buildings have an almost Victorian-era vibe with lots of intricate details in the walls, corners, and windows. While it isn’t first on the list for parks, it offers a lot of affordable, filling, satisfying food if you like hearty meals.</span> So here&#8217;s your Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood guide. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood guide for finding the best <b>comfort food</b></strong></h2>



<p>Our Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood review for<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the food scene is that it&#8217;s a great place to fill up your stomach without emptying your wallet. Follow our Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood guide for the best restaurants! </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some southern style food that draws inspiration from flavors all over the world, try</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.bcrestaurantgroup.com/hothouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Peaches Hothouse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Started by Ben Grossman and Craig Samuel, they have a really inspiring, humorous, and mouth-watering</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.bcrestaurantgroup.com/bc-restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">answer to the question</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “What is real New York style Barbeque?” At the Hothouse, you can get your fill of southern classics like Creole shrimp and grits, blackened catfish, and fried green tomatoes. Enjoy the warm, inviting atmosphere and take it easy while you catch up with the locals. This place is a little island of southern comfort amidst the NYC crush.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the most important thing to know from the Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood guide if you live in NYC but dream of exotic islands surrounded by turquoise oceans.</span> So S<span style="font-weight: 400;">well Dive isn’t a rough and tumble dive bar. The swell stands for the rising wave of tropical water, and dive is what you’ll do into the food. In conclusion, with its Caribbean décor and an extensive list of tacos, this place feels like a tropical vacation for your appetite.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bed-Stuy is known for its <b>beautiful architecture</b></strong></h2>



<p>This Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood guide wants to take you straight to <span style="font-weight: 400;">the brownstone architecture that is one of Bed-Stuy’s most striking features. Brownstone is a kind of sandstone and New York is famous for it. But even amongst NYC’s rich history and world-class architecture, Bed-Stuy stands out as a prime example. A lot of thought, subtle creativity, and ornamental detail has gone into these gorgeous buildings. A lot of modern architecture embraces a minimalism that can be elegant but easily crosses the line into sterile. Not so with Bed-Stuy’s vibrant community. So follow the </span>Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood guide and note that <span style="font-weight: 400;">when discussing Bed-Stuy buildings with your neighbor, you’re more likely to</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford%E2%80%93Stuyvesant,_Brooklyn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">use words like</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brackets, quoins, fluting, finials, frieze, and cornice branding. And yes. It all looks as beautiful as it sounds.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The neighborhood is going through an <b>exciting and dynamic change</b></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bed-Stuy is growing, changing, and evolving.</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/realestate/bedford-stuyvesant-diverse-and-changing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New restaurants and bars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are popping up all the time.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Corner store shops and cafes salt and pepper the neighborhood. Bed-Stuy had a pretty rough reputation for a while, it’s true. But the area is</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://nypost.com/2016/01/07/gritty-bed-stuy-is-starting-to-show-its-softer-side/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">definitely gentrifying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The area is attracting people who like a slower paced neighborhood with tree lined streets and lots of history.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Astoria neighborhood has tons to offer for the price. At first glance, it might seem like a quiet, middle class neighborhood. And while that’s part of Astoria’s awesome personality, don’t let it fool you into thinking this place is boring. Delicious microbreweries, astounding Greek food, beautiful parks, and more await you in this incredibly diverse neighborhood. With so many designated bike paths, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains-part-2-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting around town</a> is easy if you don’t have a car.</span> Here&#8217;s Roomi&#8217;s Astoria neighborhood review for you! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Astoria neighborhood review: <b>Greek food lover and microbrewery enthusiast paradise</b></strong></h2>



<p>C<span style="font-weight: 400;">an’t get enough Greek food and you’ve never met a microbrewery you didn’t like</span>?<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Then the Astoria neighborhood offers more happiness in a few city blocks than all of paradise combined. Beer gardens and little mom-and-pop Greek restaurants are plentiful. </span>D<span style="font-weight: 400;">on’t have a specific destination in mind? Just taking a stroll through your own neighborhood will reveal all manner of delights.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Greek food, head on over to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tavern Kyclades. It isn’t just a top destination for Greek food within Astoria neighborhood. It ranks as one of the absolute best Greek restaurants in all of New York City. The interior has art based on the famous island chain in Greece</span>. And it&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">complete with the distinctive blue and white homes and idealistic beaches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For 25 microbrews on tap and full kitchen service until 1 AM, try</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunswick 35/35. The beer covers a range of options, from hoppy to mellow so everyone can find something they like. Hearty pub fare is on the menu</span>. B<span style="font-weight: 400;">ut so are more unusual options like wild mushroom fritters for the more explorative amongst you. They’ve also got trivia and bingo</span>!<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>W<span style="font-weight: 400;">hich is always a fun way to introduce yourself to the locals when you first arrive.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>Accessible and interesting art galleries and museums</b></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond its culinary experience, the Astoria neighborhood is a really educational place. Your first stop should be the</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://socratessculpturepark.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Socrates Sculpture Park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not only are there a bunch of outdoor sculptures for you to enjoy, but there are even art classes. They’re divided into adult, teen, and kids courses</span>. S<span style="font-weight: 400;">o whether you go with friends or family, you’ll have something you can enjoy. Music, festivals, farmers markets, and yoga are also available there.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridgewood neighborhood is an affordable, quiet neighborhood of friendly and pragmatic people based out of Queens. Covering about two square miles, it offers an interesting blend of organized living and pragmatic culture.</span> All<span style="font-weight: 400;"> combined with friendly people and lots of little one-off corner stores with an old-school feel. </span>So here&#8217;s Roomi&#8217;s Ridgewood neighborhood review!</p>



<p>Firstly, <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Ridgewood neighborhood isn’t the kind of place where artists are making their name</span>. Or where<span style="font-weight: 400;"> clubs are rockin&#8217; it well into the night. In fact, this is where you go to see mothers calling out their windows for children to come home for dinner</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">nd you become a regular at a tiny store that only you and the locals know about.</span> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>A Layout For Living</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houses are the most common sight in the Ridgewood neighborhood. It doesn’t have the swooping vertical features found in the heart of New York City</span>. And that <span style="font-weight: 400;">giv</span>es<span style="font-weight: 400;"> you a nice view of the surrounding area. The stoops are typically well swept, clean, and organized. Additionally, the slower pace of the Ridgewood neighborhood is reflected in the easy-going conversations between people relaxing on the stoops and talking with their neighbors. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/realestate/ridgewood-queensan-affordable-alternative.html?module=Endslate&amp;region=SlideShowTopBar&amp;version=EndSlate&amp;action=Click&amp;contentCollection=Real%20Estate&amp;slideshowTitle=Living%20in%20Ridgewood%2C%20Queens&amp;currentSlide=Endslate&amp;entrySlide=1&amp;pgtype=imageslideshow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">35 minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get to Rockefeller Plaza and to Union Square or Wall Street from the Ridgewood neighborhood. While the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commute</a> isn’t ideal, it’s close enough to be doable but far enough to keep the housing prices lower than other parts of the city.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ridgewood neighborhood review: <b>Great for families</b></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ridgewood neighborhood doesn’t have much in the way of parks, but the</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/mafera-park/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph F. Mafera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> park is a pleasant, quiet little place to relax. It does have more choices in the form of playgrounds. The Benninger Playground, Rosemary’s Playground, and Starr Playground are just a few examples. Moreover, they provide fun spots where parents can relax and keep an easy eye on their kids</span>.</p>

They also offer music, movies, games, and even teen radio.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Corner store time machines</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scattered amongst the houses are a variety of corner stores in the Ridgewood neighborhood. Many of them feel like taking a step back in time, to when days were simpler, and people were in less of a rush. The</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/ridgewood-pork-store-ridgewood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridgewood Pork Store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one fine example. The shop window has little ceramic pigs which greet you upon your arrival. Inside, you&#8217;ll find a host of tantalizing smells and options, like smoked lamb with rosemary, and jalapeno and onion sausages. You might think this kind of quality would be super expensive, but many of the shops in the Ridgewood neighborhood are proud to be part of the community and work hard to keep their prices fair. If the houses are the bricks of the community, then these corner stores are the cement that holds it all together. Coffee, groceries, sandwiches, and more await you just around the bend.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apartments on Roomi </span>in the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ridgewood neighborhood have an average rent of $900. If you want a pleasant place to start a family or just like quiet, clean city living, Ridgewood is the place for you. It has managed to hold on to its unique lifestyle, but a</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/realestate/ridgewood-queensan-affordable-alternative.html?module=Endslate&amp;region=SlideShowTopBar&amp;version=EndSlate&amp;action=Click&amp;contentCollection=Real%20Estate&amp;slideshowTitle=Living%20in%20Ridgewood%2C%20Queens&amp;currentSlide=Endslate&amp;entrySlide=1&amp;pgtype=imageslideshow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">17 story apartment building</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is on its way. So now is the time to move in and get settled before everyone else in New York and their mother discovers what a great place this is to live.</span></p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay Ridge neighborhood is an easily missed neighborhood with a small-town feel, sitting securely amidst the organized chaos of New York City. Located in <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/know-live-brooklyn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Brooklyn</a> and snuggled up against the Upper and Lower Bay of the Hudson River, this area offers a low key place to live with access to fast paced places to work. A</span>dditionally, g<span style="font-weight: 400;">etting to Manhattan’s Union State takes</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">40 minutes, which might be a bit much for some. But it also ensures that the low cost of living in the area stays that way. So here&#8217;s Roomi&#8217;s complete Bay Ridge neighborhood review!</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>What do bicyclists, runners, and stunning seashore views have in common?</b></h2>



<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay Ridge neighborhood, as it turns out. This is a great part of town to rent a bike and cruise around, take in glistening views of the bay, watch elegant ferries float along. </span>S<span style="font-weight: 400;">top to take in the sunset with the live action soundtrack of seagulls calling in the background.</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/shore-road-park" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Shore Park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has an especially nice bike path if you want to go for a ride.

<p>And i<span style="font-weight: 400;">f jogging or walking is more your thing, there are some nice, quiet parks to enjoy in the Bay Ridge neighborhood.</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/owls-head-park" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Owl’s Head Park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has gently rolling hills and views of the gorgeous</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://web.mta.info/bandt/html/veraz.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Verrazano Narrows Bridge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that connects Brooklyn with Staten Island. It’s also a sweet spot for a picnic or a low-key game of Frisbee if you want to relax. The shade of the park’s plentiful trees is just made for lying in.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Affordable and amazing food: What small towns do best</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody does great eats that are easy on the wallet like small towns. Nobody. In fact, the Bay Ridge neighborhood has a great mix of Irish, Italian, and Arabic residents and the many delicious restaurants to prove it.</span></p>



<p><a href="http://www.wickedmonk.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wicked Monk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Bay Ridge neighborhood offers fantastic food and beer in a unique atmosphere, which has a cathedral-turned-pub feel to it. </span>Moreover, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">hey have great choices for lunch, brunch, dinner, and special late options for night owls. It also hosts live events from music to MMA.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middle Eastern food enthusiasts can head right on over to the</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.tanoreen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanoreen </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the Bay Ridge neighborhood. Additionally, they have amazing options for dining in and offer catering services. For dessert, try the house special knafeh. Crispy layers of fillo filled dough filled with sweet cream cheese, soaked in orange blossom syrup and topped with crunchy pistachios. That blurs the line between food and a magic trick.</span></p>



<p>For<span style="font-weight: 400;"> something a little classier in the Bay Ridge neighborhood, try</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://ginosbayridge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ginos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Established in 1964, they boast the best Italian food and pizza in Brooklyn for over 50 years. While that’s a pretty big claim, 50 years of happy customers is a pretty big accomplishment. Just a quick heads up, they’re closed on Mondays. But </span>that<span style="font-weight: 400;"> shouldn’t be a big deal. You didn’t really want to carb-load yourself on the first day of the work week, right?</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>The Bay Ridge neighborhood review: Affordable small town living in the big Apple</b></h2>



<p>In conclusion, the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay Ridge neighborhood has apartments starting in the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$924 range on Roomiapp.com. Moreover, it offers a chance to slow down, enjoy the ocean, and get to know your neighbors.
