										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Currently, almost everything in this world contributes to our average daily screen time per day. There are assignments, Zoom staff meetings, FaceTime playdates to virtual workouts. And not to mention the endless push notifications with the latest coronavirus news. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard not to be on these devices all day. And although it is imperative to stay connected, the digital load is unavoidable and the burnout is real.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s time to really look at our normal daily screen time per day. Then try to figure out what we want our boundaries and routines to look like with our devices. Additionally, you may find that cutting down the time on your phone makes you more productive. It&#8217;ll even make you feel more present in the real world!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Track your daily screen time</h2>



<p>Most phones have the ability to track your normal daily screen time per day. You can also get them to send you a weekly report with a breakdown of what you&#8217;re spending time on. It’s understandable that you may want to invest a certain amount of time every day to use social media. But often times things get out of hand! So having a way to track your average screen time per day is going will help you get clearer in terms of your priorities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Turn off push notifications</h2>



<p>Except for maybe calls, text messages, work priorities, alarms and calendar, turn off the constant buzzes and pings. Especially from apps like Instagram and Facebook.</p>



<p>Thanks to social media, we no longer have to wait for our 10-year reunion to see how our classmates are doing. Despite it making us feel connected in small doses, it leaves us <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6214874/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">feeling bad</a> too.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s you, maybe you don&#8217;t want to have social media on your home screen. Maybe you want to delete it entirely and then just reinstall it when you actually want to check. That&#8217;s going to help reduce your average daily screen time per day that you get sucked into.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Block distracting websites to reduce daily screen time</h2>



<p>Create a schedule blocking sites that you browse while on your computer, especially during work hours. Do it for social media, Netflix, and even the news, especially during work hours. This will help increase productivity and help you get things done faster.</p>



<p>Although it may feel more “efficient” to eat lunch at your computer, your brain will thank you for taking a break from your daily screen time. Eat lunch while chatting with your family members in the kitchen, looking out the window, or reading a physical book. Consider going for a walk (sans phone) during your lunch break, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Use audio calls instead of video whenever you can</h2>



<p>Video calls sometimes cause extra fatigue. Focusing on multiple faces at the same time while being fairly presentable can create an added layer of mental exhaustion. So you don’t have to treat Zoom calls as an automated response. If a phone call would work fine for a conversation, use that. If you can efficiently communicate what you need via email or through updating a shared document, do that. Just because you can use video, doesn’t mean you should.</p>
