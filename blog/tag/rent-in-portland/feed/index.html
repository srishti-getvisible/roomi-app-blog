<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability in Portland</h3>



<p>With Nike and Adidas’s North American headquarters located in Portland, it’s no wonder that it according to <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/today/2016/06/portland_makes_top_10_of_natio.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oregon Live</a>, Portland is the 7th most walkable city in the US. You will have no trouble trusting your feet when you want to explore the city, as many of its resident do. The city is also filled with green pastures, which make hiking a popular hobby for most residents.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Roads/traffic in Portland</h3>



<p>Unless otherwise specified, cars need to adhere to a speed limit of 55 mph or below when within the city limits. Drivers should be careful about watching out for bikes, as most roads have a shared bike lane. Ensure that you familiarise yourself with specific traffic rules, such as knowing when you can turn left or right, or using mobile phones with hands-free accessories. Generally, traffic may not be a big issue, however, most people prefer to use public transport than cars.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis in Portland</h3>



<p>As the city is quite compact, if you plan on relying on Taxis, you won’t have to fork over a large fare. Typically, fares start from $3 with each additional mile adding another $3 to the fare. You may also have to pay $1 for each additional passenger, so keep that in mind of you’re planning on travelling with your roommate in Portland. Uber and Lyft are other reliable options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public Transportation in Portland</h3>



<p>Rent in Portland may be expensive, but the transport isn’t. The TriMet provides reliable transportation throughout the city. From bus routes, streetcars to MAX light rail, residents have numerous affordable options to get around the city. Owning a car is not a necessity in the city, with bus routes serving the suburban areas as well. All buses are wheelchair friendly, making them the most accessible and affordable option.</p>
