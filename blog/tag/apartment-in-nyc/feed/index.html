<p>It’s okay to feel confused on where to start when it comes to shared apartment hunting, especially in NYC. You have all these chaotic stream of questions like “<a href="https://www.instructables.com/Tips-for-Moving-in-New-York-City/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">where to begin</a>? how to find someone to share an apartment? how to be within budget?” and so on. Here, at Roomi, we hear you! So, here’s your go-to guide that answers all questions about a shared apartment, finding your perfect roommate and room share in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is an apartment share?</strong></h2>



<p>A shared apartment is defined as two or more people who live in one permanent rental housing unit. They all are responsible for sharing costs associated with maintaining housing such as rent and utilities. In simple terms, share houses are basically rental places with shared spaces separate from your private room.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why share an apartment?</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s face it, apartments and rooms are expensive in NYC! So, for most people, renting on your own is going to be exorbitant unless you&#8217;re earning megabucks. For many, living with roommates is the best alternative to living somewhere out in the suburbs. That being said, there are plenty of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/rooms" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">opportunities to find affordable</a> shared apartments, and room share possibilities in NYC. After all, living&nbsp;in&nbsp;the city is all about living&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;the city, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Besides, it’s a great way for gathering together to share and exchange in a new way of living, and make amazing friends along the way. Shared apartments have lower initial and monthly costs paralleled to regular rental apartments. This makes life more comfortable as one can live quite reasonably in them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is a shared apartment different from room share?</strong></h3>



<p>A room share is when two friends rent a room from an owner directly. This also is the situation where there are 4 roommates living in a <a href="https://theconversation.com/room-sharing-is-the-new-flat-sharing-84359" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">2-bedroom apartment</a>. This can ruin your privacy unless you’re accustomed to the habits of your roommate.</p>

<p>In the case of shared apartment, often a business manager leases the house by finding residents to oversee and supervise the property. The management, cleaning, and responding to residents&#8217; problems are all the responsibility of the management company so you can live comfortably.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">R<strong>oom/apartment share go easy on the wallet</strong></h3>



<p>One of the room share benefits is that, you&#8217;ll split the cost of the apartment with others. This will bring down the amount you spend on rent, leaving you with more dollars in your pocket to spend on actually living. Not only will your monthly outgoings be lower, but you&#8217;ll also have to worry less about a full security deposit. This would make it easier to secure a room than a shared apartment for rent. Utilities are generally inexpensive when you split the cost with roommates too.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>With shared apartment comes shared living</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re new to a city, living with roommates gives you an instant connection, plugging you into the life of the city. Even in situations when you don&#8217;t have an established network of friends to socialize, shared apartment culture is riveting. In cases where you&#8217;ve already got a social life, you rarely feel like coming home to a silent apartment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-have-a-wide-empty-floor-area-floor-plants-are-the-answer">Have a wide, empty floor area? Floor plants are the answer!</h2>



<p>So you don’t know what to do with the empty space in a room? Invest in a floor plant! Floor plants are an awesome addition to a room that’s a bit spacious, such as a living room. Plus, floor plants are a much cheaper alternative for filling an empty space as opposed to purchasing another piece of furniture.</p>



<p>Where on the floor does your pot go? Make sure your plant is placed near a window and has enough light. In addition, make sure that your floor plant’s dimensions make sense for the room that it’ll be in. Floor plants are bound to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/cheap-life-hacks-to-turn-your-new-apartment-into-a-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make any room feel a bit homier!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-have-a-green-thumb-invest-in-succulents-and-cacti">Don&#8217;t have a green thumb? Invest in succulents and cacti!</h2>



<p>Succulents and cacti are popular flora for those who don’t exactly have a green thumb. These plants have also become a sought-after decor trend. Invest in cute potted succulents or cacti if you want a pop of life on your desk or counter! Whether you&#8217;re limited on space or just love a vibrant display, creating a versatile setup with various plants can instantly transform your space. Consider checking out some of the popular <a href="https://www.bloomsybox.com/plants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potted plants collection</a> which offers an array of choices perfect for brightening any living area. This option provides convenience and allows you to select the ideal indoor plant that suits your taste and maintenance capabilities.</p>



<p></p>



<p>These plants are hearty and well-suited for areas in which other plants wouldn&#8217;t thrive. Succulents and cacti need little water and sunlight, so they are a great alternative for those who want a real plant but don’t have the time to take care of one. Succulents and cacti can thrive anywhere, so there is no need to worry about finding the perfect spot for them!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-have-an-empty-wall-you-don-t-know-what-to-do-with-wall-hanging-plants-are-the-perfect-apartment-hack">Have an empty wall you don&#8217;t know what to do with? Wall hanging plants are the perfect apartment hack!</h2>



<p>Have a large, empty wall space in your small apartment that you don’t know what to do with? Make a wall of hanging plants! Wall plants are becoming a popular trend among plant lovers.</p>



<p>Pick your favorite wall plant or herb and put them in a small pot. Use a few wood screws to hold your plants into the wall and there you go!</p>



<p>If you’re someone who has a love for carpentry, you could even build shelves for your wall foliage. A great DIY project!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-have-an-apartment-suited-for-real-plants-go-the-artificial-route">Don&#8217;t have an apartment suited for real plants? Go the artificial route.</h2>



<p>If you don’t have the time for real foliage, go artificial! Artificial plants require no extra time and energy, so they’re perfect for anyone who’s on the go. Plus, they&#8217;ll last forever!</p>



<p>Add a pop of color to any room with an artificial plant of your choice. Fake plants are also a great option for people who want a plant aesthetic but have a small apartment that doesn&#8217;t offer enough natural light.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Get your documents in order for an apartment in New York</h2>



<p>You will need to keep your proof of income or a letter of employment handy. Along with that, your tax returns, bank statement, and credit report. References from past landlords will make your chances better when finding an apartment in New York!</p>



<p>You might also need a guarantor if you make lesser than the landlord&#8217;s required income. Or you could offer to pay more security if that settles it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. A roommate in need, is a good roommate indeed</h2>



<p>Whether you like it or not, the only way to find a cheap apartment in New York is to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">get a roommate</a>. Roommates also help with the loneliness that may become your shadow in the big city that never sleeps.</p>



<p>Head on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to apps and websites that help find the perfect roommate</a> to share rent, bills, and friendship!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Resolve all doubts before you say &#8216;this is the one&#8217;!</h2>



<p>In this case, no question is a stupid question. Any and every question you have should be resolved.</p>



<p>If you have questions about pets or pests, feel free to pester tenants and building dwellers about each and every detail.</p>



<p>Pretend you&#8217;re making an <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/8-fascinating-documentaries-about-new-york-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYC documentary</a> if you have to. But make sure you ask all questions that come to mind, instead of regretting them later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Don&#8217;t think you can leave it and come back to it later</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/cheapest-apartments-around-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">When you&#8217;ve found an apartment in New York that matches your budget</a>, your preferences, and when you can sort of imagine yourself living there, you should just go for it. Give in your documents and cheque/security.</p>



<p>Because the thing is, NYC is the place to be! And a thousand other people might be looking for a cheap apartment in New York at the same time as you.</p>



<p>So if you leave something behind, you leave it for good. It won&#8217;t wait for you to make up your mind to move in. It will be taken by another New Yorker.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The New York property rental market is pretty cut-throat. With the city having famously high rent and living expenses, finding an affordable apartment can be a huge challenge. So, what happens if you lose your job? Or if you find yourself in a situation where you must find an apartment in NYC without having a job? Is it impossible for the unemployed to secure an apartment in NYC?</p>



<p>The good news is &#8211; while it might be more difficult &#8211; you can get an apartment in NYC without a job. To help those without a job looking for an apartment in NYC, Roomi has laid out some possible avenues.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what you can expect and how you can strengthen your chances! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be patient with your search when looking for an apartment in NYC</h2>



<p>This might sound impossible but you can find yourself an apartment in NYC, without a job. In reality, patience and preparation are key when looking for an apartment in New York City. Trying to secure a new apartment without a job is likely to take much longer than if you could prove your financial security on a long-term basis, so make sure you have somewhere reliable to base yourself during the search.</p>



<p>One of the first things you need to do is find yourself a stable base while you house hunt. Especially if you&#8217;re looking for an apartment in New York without a job in your hands. The safest option is to stay with family or friends. Your current landlord might be able to help.  Landlords can offer a month-to-month lease if your current lease is due to run out.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know what landlords prefer, especially when apartment hunting without a job!</h2>



<p>A career and a solid history of payslips are some of the primary things landlords expect when considering your application. But there are other important factors that can determine if you’d be a reliable tenant. Not working at the moment? Take some time to ramp up your eligibility in the following areas.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You will need lots of savings if you&#8217;re apartment hunting without a job.</strong></h3>



<p>It’s important that you show you can financially support yourself, even if your current stream of income has been paused. This will set a positive foundation. <strong> All you need to show is that you’re capable of holding down employment and are sensible with your money.</strong> If you can prove that you have enough funds to cover six months of rent, you may just get accepted. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/5-tips-on-how-to-save-money-while-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here are some of our tried and tested ways of saving money, when living in an apartment in NYC</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Proof of future employment is also necessary if you&#8217;re without a job and searching for an apartment in NYC.</strong></h3>



<p>You&#8217;re also in luck if you’re due to start a new job in the next month or two. You can increase your acceptance chances for the NYC apartment you want through a signed contract or letter of employment!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A good credit score is a must in most apartments in NYC. </strong></h3>



<p>When being considered for a property, a great credit score puts you in a better position. It proves that you pay bills on time and can manage your finances well. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/2020/03/16/late-rent-payments-credit-score/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keep your credit score high by always paying rent on time</a>, too.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A reliable guarantor should help you if you&#8217;re without a job currently.</strong></h3>



<p>A guarantor is a friend or relative that can act as the financial guarantee when it comes to paying rent. Your guarantor should meet the following requirement if you are currently without a job and looking for an apartment in NYC:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">They should live in / close to NYC</h4>



<p>For New York City apartments, landlords usually only accept guarantors that live in the city or the surrounding Tri-state area. This is so they can sign an original copy of the lease.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Or be an institutional guarantor </h4>



<p>In cases this isn&#8217;t possible, you must use an institutional guarantor. Institutional guarantors are financial institutions willing to accept the financial liability of the rental contract in exchange for a fee. These institutions require lower incomes and credit scores to act as your guarantor.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Their wage should be much higher than your rent.</h4>



<p>Your guarantor should earn 80 to 100 times more than the monthly apartment for which you’re applying. This is a requirement that may differ in most apartments in NYC. So be sure to question your landlord on the same.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Your guarantor&#8217;s required documents are more or less the same as you.</h4>



<p>Two pay stubs, two bank statements, tax returns, and a letter of employment are the basic requirements for anyone looking for an apartment in NYC. A certified public accountant may provide a statement regarding their income if they are self-employed or own a business.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">And what are they responsible for?</h4>



<p>Once guarantors sign-on, they become responsible for any missed rent. Additionally, the landlord doesn’t always have to tell them immediately if they stop receiving monthly checks.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">? <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's everything you need to know about lease signing in New York.</a></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Consider looking into a sublet if you&#8217;re currently without a job.</h2>

<p><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/multiple_dwelling_law.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York’s Multiple Dwelling Law</a> governs the terms people have to follow in order to sublet their property. Most tenants do have the right to sublet their apartment but only with the landlord&#8217;s permission. The landlord has to have a good reason to refuse their request.</p>



<p>Subletting might be a feasible avenue for you when you&#8217;re without a job, trying to stabilize your income. Subletting generally renews every month and means you don’t have to commit to a 12-month lease. You’ll have the same rights as if you were renting. Just ensure that your sublet is a formal agreement between yourself, the tenant (or leaseholder), and the landlord.<br>Apps like Roomi make it easy to find flexible rental agreements. You can <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find safe, legal sublets and leases</a> with roommates that are vetted by us! That means finding an affordable place you love in NYC could happen faster than you thought!

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most effective thing to do when you need to sublease your apartment in New York is to remember what it was like when you were searching for an apartment. Remember the mild panic and stress sweats? Yea, not cute. Make the process and discovery of your room or apartment easy and accessible for those on the hunt.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here is everything you need to know about a sublease in New York!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1524813686514-a57563d77965?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="top-view photography of houses on a sublease in new york at daytime "/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Getting permission for your sublease.</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are very few restrictions on subleasing in New York. Obviously, you should discuss the decision with your landlord. Most should</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">be fine with this, in fact, they better have a good reason not to or you can fight them on it (legally, no landlords are to be harmed during a sublease). &nbsp;The only rules are that the sublease must be at least thirty days but no more than two years in a four-year time period.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Creating your contract.</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sublease is a legally binding contract just like your lease. Ask your landlord for this contract or any other proceedings they require. Otherwise, you can use a </span><a href="https://rentalleaseagreement.org/sublease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sublease agreement template</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here you will need to enter exact dates and prices. Remember, this is a binding contract.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Using a platform that provides similar services.</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s time to spread the word, obviously, the web is the way to go. To be even more accessible post your listing on a site that has gone mobile. Apartment listing apps are fire. </span></p>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roomi&#8217;s app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is easy to use. Once your account is created, list your apartment or room giving a full description. Take quality pictures of your place in its current condition- clean it first. All your conversations and connections can be made through the app. No need to give out personal information for every inquiry-simply chat right on the app. With thousands of NYC users, your place is sure to be spotted on Roomi.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Move on to selecting a subleaser.</h3>



<p><a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/56188/How-do-I-pick-the-right-tenants-to-sublet-or-swap-for-my-apartment-and-how-do-I-help-them-feel-at-home" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right subletter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is as difficult as choosing a roommate and far more important. You are now playing landlord. Have an interview, ask for proof of employment, and request references. Be available, respond to inquiries, and offer as many tours as you can muster. You need subletters more than they need you, so make it happen.</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Closing the deal!</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get everything signed in person and collect copies of IDs and other documents provided by the subletter. Act as a landlord, not to nag about rent, but check in on the tenant, offer solutions to the funny toilet knob, and keep in touch.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Power To The Tenants: Rent Stabilization</b> </h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York has a long-standing program for stabilizing rent. It doesn’t apply to every apartment. But if you do some homework, you can find apartments that qualify. One important thing to clarify straight away is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">there is a <a href="https://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/rent-control-vs-rent-stabilization/#:~:text=Rent%20stabilization%20is%20a%20way,less%20than%20%242%2C700%20a%20month." target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">difference</a> between “Rent Stabilization” and “Rent Control.” They have different rules, regulations, and exceptions. One is also much easier to find than the other. Rent Controlled apartments numbered about 27,000 in 2014. Rent Stabilized apartments? Oh, you know, about 1,030,000. Give or take. You can learn all about Rent Stabilized apartments</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here. Empower yourself with that knowledge, and you’ll be much better equipped to find an affordable room in NYC that will actually stay affordable.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Be Up Front: Negotiate A Pre-Pay Discount</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have the cash, try negotiating a discount in exchange for pre-paying a few months rent. It’s totally up to the landlord if they are open to this or not. But think about it from their position. Their biggest concern when renting a room in NYC is that the tenant won’t be able to pay. When you pre-pay, you are solving their biggest problem. On-time rent. That should be worth something, right? It can’t hurt to bring it up, and at worse, you just advertised you’ve got quite a bit of savings, thus increasing your chances of being approved for the lease.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Timing Is Everything: When To Find An Affordable Room In NYC</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apartment prices are like any other good or service. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/rent-report/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-november-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Price</a> is set by supply and demand. NYC has more people moving in than it has apartments available most of the time, so prices tend to be pretty stable. But is there a time of year when demand tips ever so slightly in your favor?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yup. Winter. In general, people hunker down for the winter months, nesting in their caves with popcorn, hot chocolate, and a backlist of movies to watch. If you can afford to wait, you can find slightly better prices in the winter when people are less likely to move in. But keep in mind, folks are also less likely to move out, so while you may have better prices, choices won’t be as plentiful. And you are moving in adverse conditions, so have a plan and keep it safe.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Apartment layout</b> will affect how affordable the room is in NYC</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location and layout of an apartment directly impacts its price. When you see an advertisement for a floor plan, it’s not always representative of everything that’s available. There is always one or two apartments that just don’t quite fit into the complex. Like that skinny parking spot they didn’t quite have enough room for because the mall got in the way. Apartments on the ground floor are less expensive than the ones on the top floor. Being in the middle is typically less than being in a corner because middle rooms share more walls. Ask a prospective landlord about apartments with smaller floor plans in cost-effective locations to see what’s available.</span></p>
