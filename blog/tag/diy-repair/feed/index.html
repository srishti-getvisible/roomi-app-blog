<p>We&#8217;ve spent so much time at home; some flaws we&#8217;d previously ignored may have started bothering us more these days (like when we&#8217;re with our SO for too long). So instead of running away from your problems, you could think about learning a few simple DIY repairs and DIY hacks, because well, there&#8217;s nowhere to run to when you&#8217;re at home.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/8-basic-tools-you-need-for-your-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you have the right tools</a>, there are some necessary simple DIY repair techniques that you can learn if a problem needs your attention. Because let&#8217;s face it, no matter how many times you call your landlord, the repair plan never seems to materialize. So use the energy that goes into convincing your landlord to do something, and put it into DIY repairs instead.</p>



<p>Not only will you get to feel a sense of pride in getting things done around the house, you&#8217;ll save some money too. And then you, the winner winner can ask your roomis to make you a chicken dinner as a thank you.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start learning DIY hacks then, shall we?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. DIY repairs for getting rid of the drips from your faucets</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s overwhelming when you finish watching a horror movie, and suddenly, your faucets start to leak out of nowhere. Or maybe you&#8217;ve just been ignoring the drip-dripping for months. Whichever way it goes, the tipper tapper of your leaky faucets shouldn&#8217;t become music to your ears. Apart from being annoying when you want to sleep, it also ends up wasting a LOT of water.</p>



<p>So what is your choice of DIY repairs to fix the leak? There are two ways to go about this.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shut the main valve or get the right tools to fix it on your own</h3>



<p>For a temporary fix, try this DIY hack. Find the main valve that supplies water to the faucet. Then shut it off when you aren&#8217;t using it. This DIY hack can delay a call to the plumber and save water too.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re feeling adventurous and have the right tools, get started on your simple DIY repair with The Home Depot&#8217;s tutorial.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. DIY repairs to get to the bottom of the toilet hole</strong></h2>



<p>If your toilet is clogged, it probably means your sh*t&#8217;s all over the place (in your commode). It&#8217;s icky, but someone has to deal with it. And ASAP! So wear your mask and gloves and get to the bottom of it. Don&#8217;t worry &#8211; the modern world has numerous inventions for DIY hacks like these.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Plunge, plunge and plunge!</h3>



<p>You could invest in a standard plunger or a snake plunger to free your toilet hole. If these DIY hacks don&#8217;t seem to work, try adding a little water in the bowl to facilitate better suction.</p>



<p>If nothing seems to work, you could try buying compressed air or CO2 cartridges from your local hardware store to add more pressure and unclog your toilet. They do cost a little, but still way less than a plumber.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. DIY repairs for when the doors are making too much sound</h2>



<p>Another uninvited visitor that reminds you of horror movies is a squeaky door. When they do get a bit talkative, all you need to do is lubricate the hinges for a simple DIY repair. You can try coconut, olive, or vegetable oil to do so. Pour some at the top of each hinge and let the dripping oil do the rest.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Accept the fact that your wooden doors might change with the season</h3>



<p>If your doors seem to be gaining weight in some seasons, you might just have to bear with it (like you&#8217;re probably dealing with your quarantine bod). If you have a wooden door, it can react to humid weather and increase a bit in size, hence jamming when trying to shut. It usually returns to normal once the humidity is over. So it&#8217;s best to wait this one out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. DIY repairs for filling the voids in the wall</h2>



<p>We can&#8217;t say much about filling the mental void, but filling the holes in your wall is the one of the more simple DIY repair in DIY repairs history! </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pretend you&#8217;re an artist</h3>



<p>All you have to do is get some spackling paste and fill the holes in your wall with a putty knife. Once you&#8217;re done, even it out and wait for it to dry. Next, take a chip out of your wall and get a matching paint from the paint store. Apply it on the colorless spackle and voila!</p>



<p>To get in this DIY hack zone, watch Paint Drying by Charlie Lyne &#8211; a 10-hour long movie about paint drying. If you&#8217;ve really reached that stage of quarantine, that is!</p>
