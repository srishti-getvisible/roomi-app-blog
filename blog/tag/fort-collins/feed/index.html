<p>Located in the west of the US, in Colorado, the city of Fort Collins is Larimer County&#8217;s most populated municipality. Approximately 65 miles from the state capital Denver, Colorado, and 45 miles south of Cheyenne, Wyoming, Fort Collins sits at the base of the Rocky Mountain foothills.</p>



<p>Its economy is a mix of service-related businesses and assembling. An outdoorsy, mid-sized, dynamic city, Fort Collins is surrounded by snow-capped mountains, clear rivers, and natural lakes.</p>



<p>Known for its 300-days of year-round sunshine, summers here are mild to hot, with July being the warmest. Moreover, winters are mild to moderately cold, with December being the coldest. Additionally, if you love the idea of a winter wonderland, early September through to the end of May is snow time!</p>
