<p>Getting better sleep will help you be more productive in the morning. There are many reasons as to why we might have trouble hitting the hay. With the continued weight of the pandemic, stress and anxiety are at an all time high, and it can be difficult to wind down after a stressful day at work. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-tips-for-anxiety-and-stress-management-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take a deep breath and stop stressing!</a>  </p>



<p>Here are 4 tips to help you sleep better throughout the night and improve sleep quality.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Put down the electronics to sleep better!</h2>



<p>It can be tempting to stay up and watch late night episodes of our favorite Netflix shows, or scroll through Insta and dream of one day visiting the spots in all the #wanderlust posts. However, exposure to electronics late at night can harm our ability to fall asleep, and disturb us throughout the night. Nighttime light exposure decreases our body’s melatonin levels &#8211; a hormone produced by the brain to help us fall asleep.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" data-attachment-id="10433" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-tips-for-a-better-nights-sleep/attachment/better-sleep/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1253&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1880,1253" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="better-sleep" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&#038;ssl=1" alt="woman keeping her phone down to improve sleep quality" class="wp-image-10433" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/better-sleep.jpeg?w=1880&amp;ssl=1 1880w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>To improve sleep quality keep your shut-eye in tact! For minimizing your light exposure at night, be sure to turn off electronics at least an hour before you plan to go to bed. Turn then off completely &#8211; so you aren’t tempted to open your computer back up and eye up your work emails. </p>



<p>Set an alarm to remind yourself to power off! Want to reduce harmful electronic light exposure during the day? Try using blue light glasses in order to minimize the effects that blue light has on our eyesight, and our sleep.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Skip the coffee to improve sleep quality</h2>



<p>A cup of coffee in the morning is a necessity for most of us in order to get through a long workday. However, drinking coffee later on in the day can harm our ability to fall asleep at night. Caffeine stimulates our nervous systems and as a result interferes with our body’s ability to fall asleep. Be sure to stop consuming caffeine by 3:00 pm or 4:00 pm so you sleep better at night. Craving a warm drink later in the day? Switch out coffee for a decaffeinated tea instead!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Avoid long naps during the day to sleep better at night</h2>



<p>Taking a nap during the day can be beneficial if we had a terrible night’s sleep or if we’re feeling under the weather. However, consistent or long naps during the day can throw off our body’s internal clock when it’s time for bed. Instead of taking a long nap, take a short 20-minute power nap. Or, (if it’s before 3:00 pm), have another cup of coffee to wake yourself up and power through the day. The effects of napping are different for each individual. However, if you’re a big napper and realize that your sleep is disrupted at night, try going to bed earlier instead of napping during the day!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Treat yourself!</h2>



<p>It can often be difficult to wind down after a long day at work or if we’re feeling stressed or anxious. It’s crucial to have downtime at the end of the day so our bodies are able to relax and so we can sleep better. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Practice deep breathing</h2>



<p>Have you ever tried deep breathing? Breathing is an automatic function, so we often forget to focus on our breath every once in a while. Try deep breathing to help calm your mind and body and reduce anxiety and stress throughout the day. This is one of the oldest methods of coping with stress.</p>



<p>When you’re feeling stressed or anxious, take a moment to sit down in a relaxing spot and focus on your breath. Put your feet flat on the floor with your back against a chair and feel your body being physically supported. Take deep breaths in and out until you feel your mind calm down. Deep breathing is an easy way to help be mindful of our thoughts and feelings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Practice mindfulness</h2>



<p>Mindfulness is an awesome way to help our bodies calm down when we’re anxious or stressed. Mindfulness is the awareness of your thoughts and feelings, and your ability to be in the present moment. Deep breathing is an easy way to practice mindfulness daily. If you want to get creative, try practicing yoga or meditation in order to get more connected with your mind and body! <a href="https://www.mindful.org/free-mindfulness-apps-worthy-of-your-attention/">Here&#8217;s a few apps </a>that help you along on your journey!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Take small breaks during the day</h2>



<p>Give yourself a break &#8211; you deserve it! It’s important to remember to not overwork our minds and bodies. So, take a break a few times during the day if you’re working from home or doing online classes. Walk outside for 10 minutes or play with a pet to de-stress. Your mind will thank you later! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Talk to someone you love</h2>



<p>Coping with stress becomes infinitely easier if you can share your thoughts with someone. So, when was the last time you called a parent or a friend? Working from home during a pandemic can be extremely isolating, and as a result takes a toll on our mental health. It is also especially hard to connect face to face with loved ones during COVID-19. Reach out to a close relative or friend that you haven’t spoken to in a while. They will love hearing from you, and you will feel better afterwards!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Pick up a hobby</h2>



<p>This is one of the best tips for anxiety and stress management out there. Picking up a hobby is an awesome way to de-stress at the end of a long work or school day. Moreover, it&#8217;s important to keep activities and hobbies that we enjoy a part of our lives.</p>



<p>Do you like to read? Are you artistic? Do you like to write? Find a hobby that you enjoy and make sure to set aside some time during the week to practice it. It’s important to find the right balance between work and activities that bring you joy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Make time to chill out</h2>



<p>Let yourself relax! Make sure that you take care of yourself and let yourself unwind after a long day or a long week.</p>



<p>So, cook yourself a home cooked meal, watch your favorite Netflix show, or take a bubble bath. Make an effort to do one activity each day that helps you to chill out. Having downtime will help make you feel less stressed and anxious during the week.</p>

<p>Is your skin breaking out in lockdown? You are not alone. Quarantine should technically make things easier with skin breaking out, right?  Well, is lockdown stress to blame?</p>



<p>What indeed is going on? Certainly, you are not using makeup or subjecting your skin to the stress of the harsh sun and pollution. You are also following a whole Instagram-worthy skincare regime, yet those darn angry bumps won&#8217;t go away. </p>



<p>Your girlfriends seem to be in the same fix (<em>obviously</em> not the lucky ones blessed with flawless skin&#8230; <em>ugh</em>!). Well, if you&#8217;re nodding along while reading this, here are a few reasons why skin breaking out in lockdown is still quite possible. Hint: Stress might have something to do with it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-mindless-lockdown-snacking-skin-breaking-out">1. Mindless lockdown snacking = skin breaking out!</h2>



<p>Did you buy a whole stash of lockdown snacks only to eat them all in 2 days? Definitely, guilty as charged.</p>



<p>Binge-watching and binge eating go hand in hand, don&#8217;t they? Be careful with those lockdown munchies! Not only are you devouring significant calories while stress-eating chips and baked goodies, but you may also be <a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/features/acne-foods#1](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/features/acne-foods#1)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clogging your follicles</a>, which could lead to your skin breaking out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Your body responds by cranking out more&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-types-insulin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insulin</a><em>, which increases the production of skin oils and contributes to the clogging of follicles. It can wreak havoc on your skin,&#8221; says Valori Treloar, MD, a dermatologist in Newton, Massachusetts, and co-author of&nbsp;The Clear Skin Diet.</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>When stressed, try consuming less unrefined sugar and more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Truly, you are what you eat (we all want to look like glossy donuts but it doesn&#8217;t work that way sadly).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-healthy-practices-to-keep-your-lockdownskin-in-check">4. Healthy practices to keep your #LockdownSkin in check</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-follow-a-routine-to-avoid-skin-breaking-out">Follow a routine to avoid skin breaking out.</h3>



<p>The concept of day/night has become trivial since lockdown began. Waking up late, skipping your shower, and staying in your jammies is the new normal. </p>



<p>While it is okay to take a break and skip makeup and hair care, you should not halt your skincare routine. Follow your cleanser, toner, moisturizer, and spot treatment routine every day without fail. Talk to a skincare specialist for advice tailored to your skin type.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-get-some-sun">Get some sun.</h3>



<p>Along with this, take some time to get fresh air and sun (enjoy the sun before 10 am and after 4 pm). The vitamin D will not only benefit your skin but will also lighten your dark and depressed soul (it helps, really!).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stop-picking-on-your-zits">Stop picking on your zits.</h3>



<p>Seriously girl, staaaph!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clean-your-phone">Clean your phone.</h3>



<p>Use a sanitizer to wipe the surface of your phone, and keep it squeaky clean. You can also choose hands-free to take a call instead of slapping it on your cheek whenever it rings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-try-homemade-diy-masks">Try Homemade DIY masks.</h3>



<p>Choose ones appropriate for your skin type: what a great way to feel good!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-get-enough-sleep">Get enough sleep.</h3>



<p> Netflix till 5 am &lt; good skincare.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-drink-plenty-of-water">Drink plenty of water.</h3>



<p>Your body will looove you forever!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-when-all-else-fails-stress-not-and-speak-to-a-dermatologist">5. When all else fails, stress not, and speak to a dermatologist!</h2>



<p>If your skin is just out of control, then you need to see a dermatologist. Follow all safety measures if you are planning to visit your Derma. Don&#8217;t forget to wear your mask, carry your sanitizer, and stop touching your face to keep your skin from breaking out. If you&#8217;re anxious about stepping out, consult your doc online &#8211; thank god for technology!</p>



<p>No matter what &#8211; always remember that you are beautiful! These are trying times, but they won&#8217;t last forever. Keep smiling. XO</p>
