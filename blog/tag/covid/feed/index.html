										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fashion is an industry that runs on change &#8211; with new trends, styles, and ranges being offered every season. The health crisis we&#8217;re facing now is expected to lead to changes in fashion &#8211; just like the 1918 flu pandemic, the Great Depression and the Second World War caused massive social, financial, and fashion upheaval. If you watch closely, you can already see fashion trends of 2021 taking shape right now. </p>



<p>Today&#8217;s fashion must-haves have been redefined by the wearers themselves due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than by fashion designers. Many people are working from home in pajamas and sweatpants, with shoes and makeup becoming a thing of the past. And now, before you leave the house, you have to check for your wallet, keys &#8230;and your face mask, which is all part of the &#8216;new normal&#8217;.</p>



<p>At a time when it’s more important than ever to remain indoors and work from home wherever possible, it’s also imperative to <strong>create joy wherever and however you can.</strong></p>



<p><em>Look out for these trends and go-to pieces and don&#8217;t let the pandemic dull your sparkle!</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Eco-friendly fashion trends: Shop local</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the fashion industry is trying to reinvent itself as something more sustainable. This presents a big opportunity for local brands, as there has been a significant rise in demand for local products, with consumers more aware of the issues with the fast fashion industry and the damage it has had on the environment.</p>

<p>The rise of local brands and <a href="https://theecologist.org/2020/apr/24/slow-death-fast-fashion" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the decline of fast fashion</a> indicates that a focus on sustainable lifestyles will also be part of upcoming fashion trends. So checking out sustainable and planet-friendly brands, both online and within your community, or trying out a new online thrift store is a good start to not only find some very unique pieces but also contribute towards the growth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pandemic fashion trends: Masks</h2>



<p>DIY and designer masks of different materials, filled with quirky patterns, floral embroidery, prints, and colors are the latest addition to fashion accessories.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Don&#8217;t forget the feet!</h2>



<p>In this quarantine season where comfort comes first, sliders, crocs, and flip-flops have taken center stage and are now the footwear of choice for fashionistas everywhere. Because you can wear them indoors or outdoors, it&#8217;s fantastic for the times we&#8217;re living in!</p>



<p> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Cocooning comes first</strong></h2>



<p>Why bother with jeans or suit pants while working from home? Because  Leggings are the way to go! And they are here to stay. Due to quarantine, they are predicted to stay around the the next summer season. Aren&#8217;t you so excited for 2021 fashion trends?! Consumers are looking for clothes that are practical and high quality, in soft, comfortable materials. </p>



<p>The popularity of track pants is rising, and they appear to be the biggest fashion trend at the moment.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/fiqgJGSMLtdObaBLWd" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/fiqgJGSMLtdObaBLWd/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Other classic comfort pieces are trending, as well. Sweat-shorts, for example, are a new trend we&#8217;re seeing everywhere. So are lounge pieces in neutral colors, such as greys and soft pastels.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s cocooning trend also includes puffer vests to wear indoors, alongside track pants, sweat-shorts and hoodies.</p>



<p>Looking sharp and stylish, but feeling comfy? That’s something we&#8217;re on board with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After the roller coaster ride that was 2020, we’re all looking forward to a brighter 2021. Whether your wedding was rescheduled due to the pandemic or you’ve been planning a 2021 ceremony all along, 2021 wedding trends are all about taking a &#8216;smaller but bigger&#8217; approach. But what does that mean? It&#8217;s a combination of a visually beautiful wedding experience, while keeping in mind the safety of the guests.</p>



<p>So whether you’re <a href="https://www.theknot.com/content/new-wedding-trends" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">re-thinking your plans or starting from scratch</a>, we’re listing the trends that are set to be huge for next year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-micro-wedding-trends-are-on-the-rise">1. <strong>Micro wedding</strong> trends are on the rise</h2>



<p>When it comes to recent wedding trends, it&#8217;s no surprise that celebrations are staying on the smaller side for now. With couples being much more deliberate with their guest list, leading to more intimate and smaller scale weddings in 2021. This won&#8217;t stop you from having a beautiful ceremony!</p>

<p>Due to the restrictions on wedding sizes, many couples are also opting to hold multiple smaller celebrations. Newly engaged couples are also warming up to the idea of having their wedding celebrations on available dates during the weekdays which in turn, maybe a good option for those who are on a tighter budget.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-zoom-marriages-one-of-the-popular-wedding-trends">2. <strong>Zoom </strong>marriages: one of the popular wedding trends</h2>



<p>Zoom is no longer reserved just for work calls and your weekly virtual date nights. It has also allowed those unable to attend weddings in person to experience a little of the magic &#8211; <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/coronavirus/denver-couple-says-i-do-to-zoom-wedding-friends-and-family-watched-ceremony-at-their-homes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even if it&#8217;s only virtually</a>. There is now an option of live streaming for guests, to be part of the big day.</p>

<p>This unique yet beautiful wedding trend has been a common one throughout 2020 and it&#8217;s unlikely to go anywhere for 2021.</p>



<p>We are also seeing videographer companies launching the Zoom wedding package which includes hosting the Zoom wedding with technical support, playing of media (e.g. slideshows and music) and recording of ceremony footage, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-new-normal-favours">3. <strong>&#8220;New normal&#8221; favours</strong></h2>



<p>For all of 2020 and into 2021, the health, safety and hygiene of those attending and hosting all celebrations are at the forefront during planning.</p>

<p>Many couples are choosing to embrace the new normal and get creative! Wedding trends include, trying out functional favors like customized masks and mini sanitizer bottles with personalized stickers could be a great start!</p>



<p></p>



<p>Another fascinating trend to consider is incorporating <a href="https://www.goodstoneinc.com/collections/engagement-rings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique engagement rings</a> into your ceremony. As weddings become more personalized, many couples are choosing rings that reflect their distinct styles and personal stories. This shift marks a move towards individuality in wedding symbols, perfectly aligning with other trends such as Zoom marriages and micro-weddings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-up-your-aesthetic-game-to-have-a-beautiful-wedding">4. Up your aesthetic game to have a beautiful wedding!</h2>



<p>Many couples have had to postpone celebrations for months. Just so they could go all out and celebrate with their loved ones when times allow. And <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/2021-wedding-trends" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">smaller ceremonies</a> mean more budget can be used on areas such as decorations and food.</p>

<p>The spread of COVID-19 continues to have unpredictably adverse impacts across the world. The United States, much like the rest of the world, has suffered an exponential loss. This applies to the housing market and regulations followed by property managers.</p>



<p> Experts believe that the changes adopted, as we shifted to the “quarantine economy”, will have a long-term impact. The complete extent of these changes is yet to be predicted. While the reality of eviction has been met with several governance policies, there are only a handful of policies that provide renters with the safety they hope for.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Changes_to_rent,_mortgage,_eviction,_and_foreclosure_policies_in_response_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic,_2020#States_that_implemented_policies_related_to_evictions_or_home_foreclosures" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">states protecting renters</a> through moratoriums, suspending evictions and foreclosures, there has been a notable decline in the population actively searching for new homes to rent. This changed the dynamics of the housing market. To create a demand for the same, property managers and renters’ apartment associations have to make their properties stand apart by “pandemic proofing” it.</p>



<p>The pandemic, property managers say, has forced them to make certain tweaks. Some stand hopeful that the pandemic may no longer be an issue for instance in 2024, when projects are completed.  However, none are shying away from providing a list of well- equipped amenities. As that would provide the renter with an increased sense of security at least. </p>

<p>Gloves and masks for all employees at the building is going to become the norm and cleaning is going to take on a whole new meaning in apartment buildings.</p>

<p>Limit on the number of people that can enter an elevator at once.</p>



<p>Ample supply of hand sanitizers across the building. Some might install fancier dispensers that come with multiple types of sanitizers.</p>

<p>Limited office hours / shifting to an online administration system entirely.</p>



<p>Pre-booking of common-area spaces via apps available to those living in that particular building. For instance, properties like Gotham West in Manhattan require their tenants to use an app called Amenity Boss &#8211; created during the lockdown for tenants to reserve outdoor time.</p>



<p>Virtual collection of bills and rent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-transformation-of-the-building-structure">Transformation of the building structure</h3>



<p>Decks are now the hot commodity &#8211; many buildings (Eg: Astoria Lights, a Co-Op in Queens) might soon extend their roof to double its original size after the pandemic made their dock extra popular.</p>



<p>Alchemy properties, set to start sales on the Upper West Side this fall, are opting for copper in place of steel because studies claim the virus does not live on copper as long as it does on steel. Increased use of copper for handles, gym equipment, etc. is to be expected but at a highly inflated price as copper costs 6 times more than steel.</p>



<p>Social distance gyms will also follow suit. Ashland, a Brooklyn rental, has unplugged every other treadmill they have so runners don’t get too close. To make up for the time lost, their gyms are now open 24/7.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-less-shifting-and-house-mobility">Less Shifting And House Mobility</h3>



<p>People have been generally apprehensive of moving out amid infection concerns &#8211; this poses as one of the biggest threats to the housing market which thrives on people shifting houses. Until we see a vaccine approval close on the horizon, moving will remain a concern restraining people from the market. </p>



<p>However, once we’re past the peak, those wanting a safer housing environment will definitely find themselves doing so. Many construction and upgrading projects might be postponed by property managers instead of facing a complete shutdown.</p>

<p>Affordability in the housing market, this past decade, has been somewhat of a white whale for most of us. Studies claim that in 2019 alone, a quarter of all renters spent half their yearly income on rent. But with the pandemic and current governance policies, available homes and moving families might both become a rarity. So while competitor rates in some localities might cause rents to fall, this might only be a short term phenomenon. </p>

<p>Income inequality in the U.S. has been exponentially exaggerated in the past decade. Close to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/28-million-americans-face-eviction-because-they-cannot-afford-rent.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">28 million Americans</a> faced evictions this year alone. While the richer have witnessed their housing market prices fall, the bottom 10% has witnessed a sharp incline. The pandemic’s economic trends are likely to make this gap bigger, this paves a profit for property managers. Thus, the future for renters looking to eventually own a home seems much tougher. </p>

<p>Following the Great Recession, part of the reason behind construction recovery has been the demanding nature of luxury housing. These property managers offer high-end facilities to those that are willing to pay more. This particular communities in the housing market promises to make their lives better, with higher pay. </p>



<p>Permissions handed to Multifamily Units in the past three years passed a thirty year high. These facilities will continue to offer an exquisite inventory to those willing to seek long-term refuge in their offerings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-becoming-a-homeowner">Becoming a Homeowner</h3>



<p>The past months have made a notable dent in the average millennial’s savings. Those hoping to own a home soon might have to shift expectations and delay home ownership even further. This is because home values are expected to decrease due to low supply of available homes and decreased mobility of homeowners. However, some are considering opportunities abroad, with &#8220;<a href="https://www.karenrealestate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">properties in Costa Rica</a>&#8221; becoming an appealing option for those seeking affordable investments and lifestyle changes in Central America.</p>

<p>Did you know that about 70% to 80% of the dust in your house comes from the dead skin cells we shed, tiny fibers from our clothes,  dried feces, and dust mite corpses? This is one of those &#8216;eww, gross&#8217; facts that will make you want to deep clean and sanitize your apartment immediately. Feel the itch to sanitize your room and your soul? We got you!</p>



<p> Yuck! Regular cleaning will help you keep surfaces clean, but deep cleaning is a must &#8211; especially now that coronavirus has turned us into home dwellers and home workers. The shift to working from home has got us spending more and more time in our private spaces which equals more germs and bacteria that can potentially grow around us.</p>

<p>No need to worry! &#8216;Cause Roomi has your back ? Here&#8217;s a checklist you can use to clean and sanitize room-by-room.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Before you start to deep clean and sanitize your apartment, here&#8217;s a fool-proof game plan:</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clear the clutter</li>



<li>Plan your cleaning process over a few days</li>



<li>Stock your cleaning supplies before you begin. <em>The United States Environmental Protection Agency provides this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">List of disinfectants to use against COVID-19</a> &#8211;</em> we recommend checking it out.</li>
</ol>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Don&#8217;t forget to sanitize your apartment bathrooms!</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Scrub and clean showers, bathtubs, sinks, and toilets – spray your tub with multi-purpose cleaner and let it work its magic for a while before you clean.</li>



<li>Wipe down fixtures, mirrors, and windows</li>



<li>Wash glass shower doors</li>



<li>Put cloth curtains and shower mats in the washing machine</li>



<li>Clean out under the sink and inside drawers</li>



<li>Tackle the grout – with vinegar, baking soda, and water</li>



<li>Disinfect handles and doorknobs</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tips:</em></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Wipe the base of the toilet near the floor, where dust and dribbles accumulate</li>



<li>To remove buildup on the mirror, a slightly damp dryer sheet will work well</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Sanitize your apartment kitchen: keep the pesky bugs away!</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Wipe down cabinets</li>



<li>Vacuum out the refrigerator coils and vents</li>



<li>Defrost the freezer and clean the fridge</li>



<li>Throw away old sponges</li>

<li>Clean the oven</li>



<li>Organize the pantry</li>



<li>Clean the microwave</li>



<li>Disinfect the sink</li>

</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tips:</em></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Coat gas stovetop surfaces (not the grates) with car wax, then wipe it off. The car wax will make it easier to clean up future spills.</li>



<li>Hang a writing board inside your pantry to keep notes of what you have or what you need.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Common areas</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An important step to sanitize your apartment properly is to ensure common areas are in order</li>



<li>Vacuum the space underneath the cushions from the couches and chairs</li>



<li>Shampoo rugs and carpets to sanitize them</li>



<li>Polish wooden furniture to clean them</li>



<li>Clean and wipe ceiling fans, baseboards, window treatments, and light fixtures</li>



<li>Dust your décor</li>



<li>Clean your electronics to sanitize</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tips:</em></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>To remove stains from microfiber fabrics, use rubbing alcohol by dabbing it on with a white sponge and scrub with a white bristle brush</li>



<li>The “steam” function on your clothing iron works as an excellent steam cleaner</li>



<li>Blast your wooden furniture with a hairdryer at close range, especially places with water stains and then treat the wood with a furniture polish or mineral oil</li>



<li>Use a lint roller on lampshades to remove any dust or pet hair that has accumulated there</li>
</ol>

<li>Flip your mattress</li>



<li>Dust ceiling fans, window treatments, and headboards to clean them</li>



<li>Check behind dressers and under beds and vacuum/mop</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tips:</em></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>To remove mattress stains, use a foam shaving cream. Use a slightly damp rag dipped in a half-water/half-vinegar solution to wipe off the shaving cream once it has been there for 15 minutes.</li>



<li>There could be dust clamps falling from the ceiling fans. You can prevent this by sliding each fan blade into a pillowcase to get the dust off before taking a rag to it.</li>



<li>Use a telescoping pole to your vacuum cleaner and a mop head to reach hard places on your furniture.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Closets</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You may want to skip this step to sanitize your apartment, but closet clutter takes the longest!</li>



<li>Rotate seasonal items</li>



<li>Throw away items that you no longer need</li>



<li>Vacuum carpet and ceilings</li>



<li>Wipe down shelves and inside drawers</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Tips:</em></h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>To organize smaller items like hand towels or underwear, use drawer dividers or fabric bins.</li>
</ol>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Laundry Room</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While some of us might be willing to live with life’s ills, without investing time in cleaning during quarantine, there might be some who are desperately trying to find an antidote to the shelter-in-place situation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“When all else fails, cleaning the house is the perfect antidote to most of life&#8217;s ills.” </em></p><cite><em>Sue Grafton</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>The tricky part about staying at home 24/7 is REALLY getting to know your roomis. Things you might have been willing to overlook before, come entirely into focus when you’re staying in to flatten the pandemic&#8217;s massive curve.</p>



<p>One of the aspects: coming face to face with each other’s cleaning habits. There are different species of the human race when it comes to cleaning. There are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-roomate-is-a-slob/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the slobs</a>, the indifferent ones, the &#8216;wish I were cleaner, but I don’t want to do anything about it&#8217; ones, the excessively paranoid ones, and the ones who do it once in a while as a form of therapy.</p>



<p>If your roomi is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/style/ocd-coronavirus-challenges.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">diagnosed or shows signs of OCD</a>, you should be gentle and mindful about their condition.</p>



<p>But if they don’t, and are suddenly bent on endlessly performing house cleaning during quarantine, then there are some things you could do:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cleaning during quarantine isn&#8217;t bad. Figure why it&#8217;s annoying you and talk to them about it.</h2>



<p>Feels simple, doesn’t it? We all know it isn’t. But if their ways of cleaning during quarantine are acting as an obstacle to your peaceful dwelling at home, you need to talk about it instead of sweeping it under the rug.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t like confrontations, you could look at their display picture in the eyes and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/texts-resolve-common-roommate-conflicts/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">text them your issues to sort them out.</a></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find a middle ground between both your cleaning habits.</h2>



<p>If you’re bothered by their cleaning habits, there&#8217;s a possibility they might be bothered by yours. Try and meet at the clean middle ground. Even if you like a messy room to yourself, clean up after you use the shared spaces in your house. Keep the kitchen, pantry, bathroom, and living area tidy. If they still don’t loosen up when it comes to cleaning, it’s on them. At least you did your bit.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Their cleaning during quarantine could be a coping mechanism, let them have it.</h2>



<p>If your room is a mess and you like it that way (despite the worried stares from the squeaky clean roomi), it&#8217;s best to keep your mess out of their sight. Shut your door when you come out of your room, or hide your mess like you would from your mom.</p>

				</div>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Respect their cleaning habits!</h2>



<p>You know how you can&#8217;t help <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/best-netflix-shows-series-to-watch-in-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">binge-watching on Netflix </a>for hours on end as a coping mechanism; similarly, your roomi could <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/coronavirus-stress-cleaning-organizing_l_5e792b57c5b6f5b7c5498ecb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be cleaning during quarantine as a coping mechanism too</a>. While both of these are good in moderation, you should check yourself and the people around you if it becomes an excessive habit. Tell the other that it’s all going to be okay, and they don’t need to indulge in unhealthy habits to avoid reality.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Divide your quarantine cleaning among all roommates!</h2>



<p>This might sound like work, but it will make your life easier for them and you. Take the initiative, make a list, and share it with your roomis. The advantage of taking the initiative? You get to choose what you like and leave the rest for them! Your cleaning-obsessed roomis will be happy that you took the effort and might even thank you for leaving the dirty bits for them!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Try avoiding a fight. No one should be fighting over cleaning during quarantine.</h2>



<p>If you’re laidback and don’t care much about how your home looks when no one’s visiting, try being laidback about their preferences as well. Don’t pick a fight or let it go, even if they start it. Invite them to hang out with some beer or wine and let them pour their grievances all out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hey there, procrastinators, are you all set to leave your old ways behind and be productive? Many of us are spending a lot of time indoors as work from home becomes our new reality because of COVID. While this may be something you&#8217;ve yearned for for years, it somehow feels challenging to be productive in quarantine, especially because there&#8217;s no one watching you. Working from your home office just doesn&#8217;t feel right.   </p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you start work way after sunrise or at the witching hour, whether you&#8217;re a full-time employee or a freelancer. These tips are for anyone having hard time working from their home office. Let this article be your guide whenever the lines between comfort and work start to blur.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-define-a-work-from-home-station">1. Define a work from home station</h2>



<p>If you are like 98% of us who get distracted easily, you need a workstation like an island; serene but cut off from the world. Are you familiar with the distractions of the bed and the seduction of those crisp fresh sheets that call you to nap? This is by far the hardest part of working from home. Don&#8217;t fall victim to those temptations &#8211; separate your workstation from your nap station. Start by dedicating a corner or a room as your &#8216;workplace&#8217;. That way, when you enter it, you know, you are &#8216;going to work&#8217;. Bottom line &#8211; don&#8217;t try to sleep where you work and don&#8217;t try to work where you sleep. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-set-a-work-from-home-schedule">2. Set a work from home schedule</h2>



<p>Imagine reaching your 10 am shift at the office by waking up at 10 am. Impossible right? Unless you&#8217;re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(Barry_Allen)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barry Allen</a> &#8211; then it&#8217;s possible! For a successful work from home scenario, you need to work exactly how you used to work at the real-life office. If you used to wake up at 8 to exercise and commute to work, try following the same pattern with your work from home regime. Switch your otherwise commute time with a shower, prepping coffee, enjoying a hearty breakfast, or studying your to-do list. For all of the harm it has caused, COVID has also brought with it the gift of time for a lot of us. Use it wisely. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-don-t-work-from-home-in-your-pjs">3. Don&#8217;t work from home in your PJs</h2>



<p>We are all guilty of this. Working in our PJs and throwing a shirt on top for those office conference calls has become the &#8216;new normal&#8217; during quarantine. However, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/working-from-home-tips-get-dressed-never-wear-pyjamas-stay-productive-psychology/368185#:~:text=Sure%2C%20staying%20in%20your%20PJs,sleep%20patterns%20and%2C%20perhaps%20most" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies suggest</a> that staying in your PJs all day long may adversely affect your mental health, focus and productivity.  And no one wants that when you&#8217;re already in the middle of dealing with COVID.</p>



<p>We are a product of routine, and getting dressed every day plays a huge part in our daily routine. One of the biggest luxuries of work from home is the freedom to wear what you want. So ditch your regular sleepwear and get into those comfy clothes and only change into your PJs when you decide to call it a day.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-declutter">4. Declutter</h2>



<p>All the messy people in the house get your hands up&#8230;and clean. If your workstation adorns superhero miniatures, tangled up wires, and dishes from last night &#8211; it&#8217;s time for you to put those things away and declutter. COVID is already stressful enough, you don&#8217;t a messy home environment to make it worse.</p>



<p>An ideal desk should be close to a window and have all the stuff you need, like a bottle of water, quick snacks, and stationery. The goal is to avoid distractions, your trips to the fridge, and to maximize productivity. And who knows, maybe you&#8217;ll finally be able to revamp your home decor in quarantine!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-give-yourself-a-break">5. Give yourself a break</h2>



<p>Just because you&#8217;re at home all the time because of quarantine, doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t need a break. After all, most people haven&#8217;t been able to relax since they found out about COVID. But you need to schedule break times and use them to recharge (come what may). This will increase your productivity, especially when you start boring tasks that you have been procrastinating over for a while.   </p>



<p>When beginning these tedious tasks, set a 15-minute timer and train yourself to focus. When you know that there is light at the end of this dull tunnel, you will glide through it like a pro. Make sure your breaks are not more than 10 minutes, or this activity will turn counterproductive. ou can even consider playing PC games during your break and use your favorite game items, such as a <a href="https://www.yuplay.com/product/fortnite-catwomans-grappling-claw-pickaxe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Catwoman pickaxe</a>, to unwind and refresh your mind.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-prepare-your-to-do-list-and-your-meals-the-night-before">6. Prepare your to-do list and your meals the night before</h2>



<p>The pain of working from home and prepping your meals alongside this is something that we are all too familiar with. Save yourself the trouble and prep your meals and your to-do list the night before &#8211; it saves you plenty of time and energy and is something the entire Roomi team swears by. How else do you think you get an article every day?! Also, for all of you living on instant noodles and potato chips &#8211; get yourself a real meal, you guys! You can become amazing home chefs by the time quarantine ends if you start now! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living with roommates has its pros and cons, but in times like these when you’re stuck inside, it is often easy to focus more on the cons. If you&#8217;re not exactly BFFs with your roomis, it can feel like a challenge to navigate this isolation period &#8211; especially when you have to implement novel social distancing measures in a place that feels smaller by the day. But self-quarantine with your roommate isn&#8217;t as difficult as it may seem in theory.</p>



<p>So now more than ever, there is a need to find the perfect roommate equation till our outside lives resume again.</p>



<p>Here’s our guide to be your best self while you self quarantine with your roommates:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Start by getting to know each other</strong>, of course.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="646" data-attachment-id="1410" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-self-quarantine-with-roommates-without-losing-your-sanity/attachment/roomi-blog1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?fit=500%2C646&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,646" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="friends meme" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?fit=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?fit=500%2C646&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?resize=500%2C646&#038;ssl=1" alt="a collage from the show &quot;Friends&quot;, where the actors who live together as roommates are playing a word guessing game" class="wp-image-1410" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/roomi-blog1.jpg?resize=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1 232w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>When seeing so much of each other while housing in captivity, the best thing you to do is look at the situation in a more positive light. Instead of texting your friends about how hard it is to adjust, or how you wish you were quarantining with them instead, it is time to be friends with your roommate.</p>



<p>Play an ice-breaking game that urges you to confess one negative thing, followed by one positive thing about each other. In your free time, invite them to play board games you all enjoy. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/science-roommate-makes-happier/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crack open a beer and order some tacos, ask them about their lives, and tell them about yours.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learn something new together!</h2>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If you and your roommate share different backgrounds, try learning parts of their language or cooking their favorite family dish. On the other hand, if you’re from the same cultural background, surely there are some things you never bothered to learn about them. Maybe you can finally try to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/sharpen-your-professional-skills-in-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">understand what they do for a living!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Plan movie nights as you self quarantine with your roommate.</h2>

<p>Take turns to pick out your favorite movie/series while you munch your way through packs of Doritos. You might discover there are more similarities than you thought.

<p>The most crucial thing to keep any relationship healthy is to respect each other’s need to be alone. Make arrangements for the other person to know that they don’t want to be disturbed. Make a (friendly!) do not disturb sign or hang a sock at your doorknob. The more you respect each other, the easier it will be to be the perfect roommate!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Cleaning together when you self-quarantine with your roommate!</h2>

<p>Self-quarantine with roommates can be anxiety-inducing for some, but don&#8217;t let those hygiene standards slip! Wash your hands frequently and if you suspect you might be ill, wear a mask when you’re around roommates. Don’t leave a mess after cooking, bathing, or snacking on the couch. Get rid of expired stuff in your pantry and it wouldn&#8217;t hurt you to open a window from time-to-time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Keep the communication <em>open</em> with your roommate.</h2>

<p>While it is always unhealthy, being passive-aggressive might have worked for you before. But right now, communication is key to being the perfect roommate. Keeping your problems to yourself right now can be devastating &#8211; building resentment and destroying your inner peace. Learn how to communicate with your roommates about how their habits affect you. If you’re not keen on confrontation,<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/texts-resolve-common-roommate-conflicts/1157/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> you could use texts to resolve conflicts.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Cut each other’s hair (if you&#8217;re both interested, of course)</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

	</div>
	


<p>Remember at the start of quarantine, when everyone was trying to cut their own hair? If you&#8217;re still waiting for your go-to salon to open, why not try it yourself! Let your roomi give you a fun makeover. Embrace the new look and indulge in a photoshoot!</p>

<p>Well, what a bummer summer has been so far; one bad news after the other. It&#8217;s only natural to feel sad and frustrated when you&#8217;re in quarantine. We&#8217;re all sitting on our couches, out of things we can do at home. Many of us are working from home, and most of us are just Netflix-ing and vegetating. </p>



<p>So, while the world takes its time to heal, here&#8217;s what you can do with all that free time you have. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Try your hand at some art therapy as you quarantine.</h2>



<p>Everybody can draw. Yes, even you! Coloring, drawing, and sketching are said to relieve stress, improve focus, and enhance sleep. If you&#8217;re a beginner, try mandala patterns or adult coloring books &#8211; it&#8217;s all bout having fun and creating something unique.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Aprender un nuevo lenguaje ?</h2>



<p>That means &#8216;learn a new language&#8217; (in Spanish).

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Train your dog a couple of quarantine tricks</h2>



<p>Honestly, our dogs are the only ones who are super happy about this whole COVID 19 quarantine &#8211; how else could they possibly spend sooo much quality time with you? Having said that, they too get bored, and all that boredom leads to chewed up bedsides, earphones, and finding shredded toilet paper trail around your house. You can not only train them to get beer cans from the fridge but also correct<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/zakgeorge21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> essential behavioral problems </a>while bonding at home with your doggo.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Give back through some online volunteering during such trying times.</h2>



<p>Do you wish to do social work and help organizations reach out to humans/animals in distress? With the COVID 19 virus keeping all of us inside our homes, it might seem challenging to volunteer. However, there are organizations like the <a href="https://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">UN</a>, <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zooniverse</a>, <a href="https://www.togeanconservation.com/remote-volunteer-openings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Togean Conserve Foundation</a> who are running virtual volunteer programs(how cool is that!) and are looking for good peeps like yourself.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do it yourself! DIY is a gift for those of us stuck at home.</h2>



<p>Think you don&#8217;t like DIY? Think again. With all the creative possibilities available to us, there&#8217;s gotta be something out there you can build. Either way, it&#8217;s time you harness all that hidden talent and put it to good use. Go grab your glue gun, scissors, and everything DIYish you can lay your hands on because today we are <a href="https://in.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=diy&amp;rs=typed&amp;term_meta%5B%5D=diy%7Ctyped" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">making something super pretty for your room</a> and for the gram.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Read a book or twelve as you quarantine.</h2>



<p>Are you an avid reader or an avid book collector (don&#8217;t try to lie to us, your bookshelf is a playground for dust bunnies.) </p>



<p>Anywho, Lo and behold an opportunity for all of you who complained about not having enough time to read &#8211; this quarantine and lockdown has just sent us back home to get our sshhh&#8230; together, rethink life, and to read good books!</p>

<p>Here you have unlimited lives and death doesn&#8217;t matter(unless you forgot to save your game, then you&#8217;re screwed), you have a great bod, you can control your life, and you can go anywhere you want(Nepal or the underground &#8211; the world is your playground). <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Try steam</a> and let off some steam.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be a superhero!</h2>



<p>Ok, yes, we know it sucks to be at home in quarantine, but remember that you&#8217;re a real-life HERO! You&#8217;re not only protecting yourself but millions around you by staying home during this challenging time of Corona induced quarantine. </p>
