<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-turn-off-lights-when-you-leave-a-room-for-a-more-eco-friendly-lifestyle">1. Turn off lights when you leave a room for a more eco-friendly lifestyle</h2>



<p>Here’s an easy one! Turning off the lights when you leave a room may seem like a simple task, but it makes a huge impact. Not only will turning off lights save you money on your energy bill, but it will also reduce your carbon footprint.</p>



<p>You can even make the switch to energy-efficient light bulbs, such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). These bulbs will not only save energy but they will save you money too. Remember to turn off your lights next time you leave a room!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-easy-eco-friendly-lifestyle-switch-buy-a-reusable-water-bottle">2. Easy eco-friendly lifestyle switch: Buy a reusable water bottle</h2>



<p>Ditch the plastic! Reusable water bottles are cheaper and more sustainable than buying cases of plastic bottles. <a href="https://biofriendlyplanet.com/green-alternatives/reusables/the-environmental-advantages-of-reusable-water-bottles/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">38 million water bottles</a> end up in landfills in the United States each year.

<p>Buying a reusable water bottle, such as a Hydroflask, will not only reduce waste but improve your overall health as well. <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://biofriendlyplanet.com/green-alternatives/reusables/the-environmental-advantages-of-reusable-water-bottles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Plastic water bottles contain loads of chemicals, such as BPA</a>, that no one wants to be putting into their body. Go green and stay healthy by switching to reusable water bottles!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-eco-friendly-fashion-lifestyle-buy-from-thrift-stores">3. Eco-friendly fashion lifestyle: Buy from thrift stores</h2>



<p>Avoid contributing to the fast fashion industry by purchasing clothes from thrift stores. Fast fashion is inexpensive clothing made by large companies. The fashion industry has a huge impact on the planet. This industry contributes to rising carbon emissions as well as pesticide use.</p>



<p>Help the environment by buying from consignment stores (buying from thrift stores will <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-easy-tricks-to-spend-less-save-more-roomi/1641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">save you money too!</a>) Go green and try browsing thrift clothing websites such as Poshmark or Thredup. You can even sell clothes that you don’t wear on Poshmark!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-use-reusable-grocery-bags">4. Use reusable grocery bags</h2>



<p>Another easy way to go green! Not only are reusable bags more durable than plastic, but they’re also safer for the environment. Switching to reusable grocery bags will help decrease plastic waste. Plastic bags (and water bottles) can take between 15 and 1,000 years to break down!</p>



<p>Plastic bags are also a health hazard for wildlife. Animals can get entangled in these bags and some may even try to eat these products. Help out our earth and wildlife by making this eco-friendly switch. Invest in a fashionable bag and you can even use it as a tote for other purposes!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-make-a-compost-bin">5. Make a compost bin</h2>



<p>Food waste contributes to around <a href="https://www.rebelgreen.com/composting-facts-tips/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">30% of the food supply</a> in the United States. Yikes! Composting is an awesome solution to this issue. Composting helps to keep out excess food out of landfills, and it helps to nourish the environment. Compost enriches the soil and aids in plant growth.</p>



<p>Use food scraps such as eggshells, fruit, and vegetables to create your compost. Not sure where to start? <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Click here for a simple guide on how to start composting at home!</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>Bonus Tip: Support nonprofits driving environmental change</p>



<p>Making small eco-conscious changes at home is a powerful start. You can amplify your impact by supporting organizations dedicated to protecting the planet. Whether through donations, volunteering, or partnerships, teaming up with the right nonprofit can turn your lifestyle changes into global action. Check out this list of <a href="https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/20-global-nonprofits-environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top nonprofits fighting for the environment</a> to find one that aligns with your values.</p>
