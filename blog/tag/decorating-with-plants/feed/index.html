<p>The love for growing plants, once kindled, is an undying one! A person who is aware of their green thumbs – or even trying passionately to convert their regular thumbs – just cannot be content unless there are plants around. It’s an obsession we at Roomi understand!</p>



<p>But <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/roomis-guide-to-studio-apartments-and-small-spaces-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">when you live in a small apartment</a> in a city like New York with not enough space for those dear plants, things can seem despairing. But, of course, you’ll try your best to fit some in!</p>



<p>We have some tips for accommodating indoor plants in a NY apartment:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get houseplants that thrive in low light</h2>

<p>A small apartment doesn’t get enough light all around. Get plants to keep in spaces darkened with shadows, which in turn will balance the cheeriness across your apartment. The space next to your bed and the top corners of your kitchen shelves are such spots.</p>



<p>Some low-light loving indoor plants include the snake plant (<em>Dracaena trifasciata</em>), ZZ plant (<em>Zamioculcas zamiifolia</em>), maidenhair fern (<em>Adiantum</em>), and Swedish ivy (<em>Plectranthus australis</em>).</p>

<p>Hang a wall planter with small pots for small indoor plants, and this will double as décor. There are many types of wall-mounted planters, but the easiest to take care of is the one with narrow shelves on which you can place your small pots with trays underneath to hold water and any spilling dirt.</p>



<p>Try planting Christmas cactus (<em>Schlumbergera</em>), pothos plant (<em>Epipremnum aureum</em>), English ivy (<em>Hedera helix</em>), and herbs (oregano, sage, rosemary, mint, and thyme).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hang plants by your windows</h2>

<p>Grow the plants that like direct sunlight in hangers; this way you’ll be mindful to keep your windows open and your room bright. It’s a good thing because <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/why-natural-light-is-the-best-apartment-decor-ever/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">both you and your plants can benefit from bright natural light</a> in the middle of New York! Lighter plants and vines work great in pots held in midair with macrame hangers, as do air plants.</p>



<p>Some good options for hanging houseplants are arrowhead plant (<em>Syngonium podophyllum</em>), Chenille plant (<em>Acalypha hispida</em>), staghorn fern (<em>Platycerium</em>), and trailing jade (<em>Peperomia rotundifolia</em>).</p>



<p>Hang the ones that don’t like direct sunlight in the kitchen or by the wall planters!</p>

<p>Did you think you can’t fit in a beloved big plant in your tiny apartment? Wrong! You’re forgetting corners where you can’t keep small houseplants, or that a big plant can be used as a great piece of décor that also hides the ugly bunched-up wiring on the wall. You can even make that empty corner by just pulling your desk a little this way along the wall.</p>



<p>Get a couple of good-looking pots and you can grow your tall cacti, rubber fig (<em>Ficus elastica</em>), majesty palm (<em>Ravena rivularis</em>), and Swiss cheese plant (<em>Monstera deliciosa</em>).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Grow plants that love humidity in the bathroom</h2>

<p>Living in the midst of beautiful art is bound to put you in a better frame of mind and make your day a lot better. To decorate your shared apartment, one needs a lot of brainstorming. After the year we’ve had, we could all use some pleasant changes, right? Now we know what you’re thinking &#8211; do you have any idea what that costs? Bear with us- we can give you 4 home decor ideas for a shared apartment even on a budget.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>The ability to make somebody feel something: that&#8217;s art. However you look at it, whether you&#8217;re an author, a painter, a singer, a rapper, a spoken-word artist &#8211; art.</p><cite>Wale</cite></blockquote>



<p>Let’s start with the whole notion of art itself. It’s not just Picassos and Jackson Pollocks. As Wale so expertly explains above, art makes you feel something. So it’s not restricted to a framed piece or even something that’s bought. Look within to find something that stirs your soul. The golden light of sunset? Sunflowers that remind you of home? A photograph of your dear ones? A cherished letter? Then you find something that channels that feeling. Here are a few ideas to get you going:</p>

<p>One of the best things about signage is that it can say anything you want it to. It can be an inside joke that makes you smile every time you see it. Or it can remind you of your favorite bar back home or be reaffirming. It also doesn’t have to break the bank as it can be a weekend DIY project!</p>



<p>We love LED signage because it channels an edgy, New York City vibe home decor. Choose from chalkboard signage, 3-D paper lettering, or marquee signage.</p>

<p>As we look back on our lives, memories stand out. Family gatherings in your backyard or days out with your friends. What could be more soulful than a gallery of the significant moments in your life?</p>



<p>You can choose uniform frames to hold the pawprints of that furry friend who stole your heart, a pressed flower from your garden at home, or movie stubs from the day out with your friends. It could be anything as long as it really makes you feel something. Frame it so you can remind yourself of the good times.</p>

<p>This idea is great for the public spots within shared apartments, especially for making them picture-perfect. Create ‘corners’ of art with a variety of textures, colors, and home decor pieces.</p>



<p>Roommates can merge elements that are personally meaningful to them. Think pops of color, artistically positioned mirrors, or flowers. This is a collaborative process to help you learn more about your roommates and bring you closer together.</p>

<p>Isn’t art trying to recreate nature after all? Why have a painting of a sunflower when you can have the sunflower itself blooming in your living room?</p>



<p>Apartment decor and plants are a duo that will work in all spaces: small apartments, large apartments, shared apartments, and even in your own room! Imagine being able to feast your eyes on a truly green space whenever you want. Using plants in home decor is a trend that we’re happy to get behind!</p>



<p>Whether you purchase art worth thousands of dollars or frame a drawing made by your little niece- you’re looking for pieces that move you. We recommend decorating shared apartments with pieces that aim to uplift those who live in them.</p>



<p>Just like art does.</p>

<p>Decorating with plants has become the quarantine hobby of the year. From seasoned plant moms to novice gardening enthusiasts, home decor is taking an official green turn.</p>



<p>The desire to suddenly acquire green fingers goes beyond the beautiful aesthetics added by plants to home decor. Being stuck in our homes for most of 2020 had us craving the outdoors and fresh air like never before. For many, gardening and decorating with plants has given them much-needed respite within the comfort of their homes.</p>

<p><strong>So what happens if you’re enthusiastic about planting succulents all over your house— but honestly, truly, don’t know how to keep a plant alive to save your life?</strong></p>



<p>Do your plants die mysteriously in their plant pots, robbing you of your dream of decorating with plants? Fear not, because Roomi is here with a rookie guide for the gardening newbies.</p>



<p><strong>Read on for the basics on everything from planting succulents, the importance of plant pots, and everything in between. After this, you might just become an expert on decorating with plants and gardening. Or you can just fake (plant) it till you make it!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. When decorating with plants: Lighting is everything, honey!</h2>



<p>Just like the beauty models on Instagram, plant babies thrive on the natural lighting in the house.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/plant-leaf-botany-wCMrcyfZtK0z6"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/wCMrcyfZtK0z6/giphy.gif?resize=250%2C145&#038;ssl=1" alt="David Documentary GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="250" height="145" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>You may be eager to use all your Pinterest-inspired plant pots and start decorating with plants to create a mini-forest in your house—&nbsp; but there are a few things to keep in mind first.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A common rookie mistake is to perch the plant pots on windowsills or a sunny-seeming corner. <strong>Just like us humans, our plants don’t want to be sunburnt or get winter chills!</strong> It is good to do a quick lighting check in each room of the house.</li><li><strong>Light tip: South-facing windows will allow the brightest natural light, followed by east and west for moderate exposure and north-facing for low light.</strong> The farther away from the window, the less the natural light!</li><li>Your plant might be your home decor shining star, but it might have come all the way from another city in the back of a dusty truck. Give it some time to adjust to its new home!</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Watering basics for the gardening rookie</h2>



<p>Okay, so do we <em>really need</em> to go over watering plants? Plants get thirsty just like us right?</p>



<p><strong>Well, it might be helpful to remember that when decorating with plants, overwatering kills.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/surfacesmusic-surfaces-sunday-best-USVcG3KoPapnzvhvuO"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/USVcG3KoPapnzvhvuO/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Surfaces GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>You know that feeling you get when you step into a puddle of water with socks on? Think of that when you water, because even plants don’t like their feet soggy and wet! Look for plant pots with holes. Be sure to dump out excess water from the plant pot after watering and keep a saucer under the pot to allow proper drainage.</p>



<p>If you’re planting succulents or similar species, remember that they need watering only every 7-10 days.</p>



<p>Here’s a short <a href="https://bloomscape.com/beginners-guide-houseplants/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">watering basics video</a> from Bloomscape to help take care of those plant beauties in your home decor:</p>

<p>In the quest for decorating with plants, many innocent have fallen prey to glamourous and easy-to-maintain succulents! I mean, <a href="https://debraleebaldwin.com/">Debra Lee</a> straight up wrote a book about design and planting with succulents, so there is definitely star value here!</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Succulent darlings come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. They need watering only every 10 days to two weeks.</li><li>These plants need bright light, but putting them on a sunny window is a sure way to give them a sunburn.</li><li>They store water in their leaves, stems, and roots so you can almost let them go completely dry.</li></ul>



<p>Don’t forget to dress your plant children up in some beautiful, porous ceramic plant pots to upscale the home decor! Hang up the plant pots for an extra edge when decorating with plants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. I’m dead.. I’m alive but I’m dead!: Dormancy phases of gardening</h2>



<p><strong>We’ve all had an “oops, I killed my plant!” moment. It&#8217;s alright— you are not a bad mother if your child looks dead.</strong></p>



<p>Like human beings, plants too go through “dormancy” phases. This can happen within a 24 hour period, and often usually after they fully bloom.</p>



<p>Dormancy phases in gardening can vary based on the plant you have, even when you&#8217;re planting succulents. The plant pots can look dilapidated during summer or winter dormancy. This is a rest phase before the plant blooms full cycle again. Be sure to do a bit of research to ensure decorating with plants stays easy for you.</p>

<p><strong>If you want plants that are more perennial, consider investing in an edible herb garden. Gardening + fresh mint for lemonades = happy plant parents.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Why you need to DTR (define the relationship) before adding plants to home decor!</h2>



<p>Plants are living, breathing, colorful creatures that are life-affirming to care for. So when you’re flirting with the idea of decorating with plants, you really need to define the relationship you can have with your future plant children.</p>



<p>Are you looking for something casual or committed to a long-term affair? Get real about your work hours and schedule. Gardening and being a plant parent means catering to each of your plants, which may all run on different schedules over the year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I know we all want a lush, green forest feel in our living rooms, but nobody wants a dead jungle in their house. Do you need to break up with your succulents? Think tactfully through so you can ensure the best experience for both you and your plant babies. I mean, fake plants aren’t THAT bad.</p>

<p>Being stuck inside our homes in 2020 was a challenging experience for us all. However, the new year brings a wave of home decor creativity as we reinvent our homes to fit our changing lifestyles.</p>



<p>We now look towards new, imaginative living room decor trends to accommodate our transformed lives.</p>



<p>Prior to pandemic life, our living spaces did not anticipate self-isolated dance parties, or long hours of working on our couches. As a result, we are readapting our home and living room decor to match our different needs through the day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">See also: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/work-from-home-essentials-for-the-renting-roomi/2161/">How To Create The Perfect Workspace At (Your Rented) Home</a></h3>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/home/decor/home-design-trends-2021?slide=d83b5873-21f1-47ee-8734-dc52747bbb66#d83b5873-21f1-47ee-8734-dc52747bbb66">Southern Living</a>, in 2021 many are opting for a decorating style that is the equivalent of “athleisure” aka comfy and chic.</p>



<p>Our disconnect from nature while stuck indoors has created a craving for an earthy feel. Decorating with plants has made a strong comeback to home decor. ****</p>



<p><strong>Altogether, 2021 screams PERSONALITY through large wall art, bold living room decor, and an inclination towards a certain “Grandmillenial” style.</strong></p>



<p>Want to jump on the “new year, new me” bandwagon? Roomi is here to provide you with a mood board with fresh ideas to liven up your current living room decor— guided by interior design experts and good old Pinterest.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. “Grandmillenial home decor”</h2>



<p>Uncertain times are urging a certain sense of nostalgia and need for stability in our homes. Nicknamed “granny chic”, this trend creates space for bold, highly-detailed design or floral wallpaper into home decor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="564" height="838" data-attachment-id="6094" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/room-decor-mood-board-for-a-fresh-start-in-2021/attachment/image-29/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?fit=564%2C838&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="564,838" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-29" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?fit=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?fit=564%2C838&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?resize=564%2C838&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6094" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?w=564&amp;ssl=1 564w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png?resize=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1 202w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to incorporate the Grandmillenial style into living room decor or bedroom wall art?</h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Neon bedroom wall art</h2>



<p>We can blame Gen Z for bringing back Neon bedroom wall art. Tiktok dances have created the need for snazzy backgrounds that include large wall art or neon-colored lighting to add that 80s retro feel.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/decorating/home-decor-trends-2021">Pinterest</a> searches for &#8220;neon room&#8221; have increased eight times, while the search for &#8220;LED light signs&#8221; has increased three times. The statistics don’t lie, and soft, glowy bedroom wall art is certainly all the rage in 2021.</p>
