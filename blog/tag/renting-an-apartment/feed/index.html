<p>The rental application process can seem overwhelming if you&#8217;re a first-time renter. It&#8217;s nothing to be worried about! As long as you take care and follow all the steps in this guide, you&#8217;ll be able to do the rental application process without a problem.</p>



<p>With forms to fill out and documents to submit, the rental application process takes patience and a lot of effort. Here&#8217;s all you need to know about the steps and process of signing a lease.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-key-steps-in-the-rental-application-process"><strong>5 Key Steps in the Rental Application Process</strong></h2>



<p>Before you proceed, be sure to look up information specific to your city. These are steps that you&#8217;ll need to complete as a part of the rental application process in general.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-step-1-fill-out-your-rental-application"><strong>Step 1: Fill out your rental application.</strong></h3>



<p>A rental application is a form and a set of supporting documents. This includes some personal information about you like residence history, income, references, pets, and anything relevant to renting a property.</p>

<p>A rental application is used by landlords to screen potential tenants and decide who will be a good fit for the property. This process varies for each building or residence, some forms can be filled up online or collected from the landlord when you visit the place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 2: Submit the required documents.</strong></h3>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to submit certain documents as a part of the rental application process to help the landlord establish your identity and screen you.</p>



<p></p>



<p>To keep your documents organized on your Mac, it&#8217;s essential to manage them efficiently to avoid duplication and unnecessary clutter. When preparing your documents for submission, you may find duplicate files or unwanted trash that can hinder the process. Streamlining this process is key, and for those needing to organize large documents before submission, consider the ease of <a href="https://theonlineconverter.com/split-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">splitting your PDFs</a> to manage individual files.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Using <a href="https://cleanmymac.com/blog/best-free-iphone-cleaner-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone cleaners</a> can help you streamline your file management, ensuring that you only keep the necessary documents. This not only makes the application process smoother but also helps maintain a tidy and easily accessible digital workspace.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Be sure to submit all the required documents to ensure that there aren&#8217;t any hiccups in the process.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a list of things that you will need to submit as a part of your rental application:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Contact information:</strong>&nbsp;Your email ID, phone number, and address.</li>



<li><strong>Cover Letter:</strong>&nbsp;Make an impression and introduce yourself.</li>



<li><strong>Proof of Income:</strong>&nbsp;Submit proof of your employment if you&#8217;re a working professional.</li>



<li><strong>Social Security number:</strong>&nbsp;This is needed for background and credit checks.</li>



<li><strong>Documents:</strong>&nbsp;Identification cards or documents to prove your identity.</li>



<li><strong>References:</strong>&nbsp;Have a past landlord or supervisor vouch for you.</li>



<li><strong>Pets:</strong>&nbsp;Breed, size, and weight of your pet if applicable.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle information:</strong>&nbsp;The make, model, and registration of your vehicle if applicable.</li>



<li><strong>Emergency contacts</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It&#8217;s good practice to write a cover letter along with your application. Much like a job application, it lets you tell the landlord about yourself and make an impression. A cover letter also allows you to explain any issues with your history. You can explain prior convictions, failures to pay rent, evictions, or any other problems. A cover letter is an important part of the rental application process and shows you&#8217;re interested.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 3: Pay the rental application fee.</strong></h3>



<p>Generally, there will be a fee for you to pay as a part of the rental application process. This fee is usually between $30-$50 and varies based on location or the landlord. Usually, this fee is taken to fund background checks on potential tenants.</p>

<p>In some cases, there may also be processing fees that may or may not be refundable. Be sure to ask the landlord for a breakdown of the fees and whether they&#8217;re refundable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 4: Provide references.</strong></h3>



<p>Landlords will want to know if you had or caused any issues in the past. Proving that you have a good history is important. Landlords will not give an apartment on rent if you have caused property damage or broken the terms of your lease in the past.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a first-time renter and don&#8217;t have any rental history, get personal references! Personal references can make or break an application in these cases. A figure of authority or supervisor can vouch for your character and dependability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 5: Sign the dotted line!</strong></h3>



<p>Provided all has gone well and you’ve been accepted, you&#8217;ll now have to sign your lease. Congratulations! This is the final step of the rental application process. Make sure you go over all the terms carefully.</p>



<p>Also, take one final look at the premises and ensure everything is in order. This is also when you&#8217;ll need to discuss and pay upfront costs. It&#8217;s standard to pay the first month’s rent and move-in fees or security deposits as required.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How long does it take to process a rental application?</strong></h2>



<p>You can expect background and credit scores, references, residence history, other documents you&#8217;ve submitted to be checked as a part of the rental application process.</p>



<p>The time it takes can vary from one landlord to the other, but on average is around 24-72 hours. Some properties may take longer than this, but you&#8217;ll usually be informed in that case. If you haven&#8217;t heard back in 72 hours, you can contact the landlord and ask for an update.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-research-is-key">1. <strong>Research is key</strong></h3>



<p>Start by checking the market prices of similar apartments in your area, and find your apartment’s actual worth. If your landlord is trying to charge more than the market rate, then you’ll need to negotiate. You don’t want to pay more for a rental that other tenants enjoy at a lower price.</p>



<p>Part of your research should include talking to other tenants around the area. Find out how much they pay for a similar apartment and compare. If they pay less, you can negotiate a rent increase with your landlord, especially during lease renewal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-state-your-case-properly">2. <strong>State your case properly</strong></h3>



<p>Let your landlord know why you want to negotiate. Be as authentic as possible, and lay out the facts about your situation. Let them know how an increased rent would negatively impact you or your roommate(s). When you’ve done your research and understand more about the apartment’s rental value, it becomes easier to state your case. Preparation is key!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-bargain-for-upgrades">3. <strong>Bargain for upgrades</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re facing a rent increase that you can’t get out of, you can ask for an upgrade in your apartment. You may be willing to pay more to have an important upgrade or repair done. Don’t bring up a long list of improvements, but asking for one or two upgrades that reflect the new price is usually fair.</p>

<p>When trying to get out of a landlord increased rent, you can try making a compromise. Think about what your landlord might want in return to make an offer they can’t refuse. Here are some things to try:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If you can see yourself staying in that apartment for a while, offer to renew your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi/">lease</a> when it expires.</li><li>Offer to pay rent a couple of months ahead in exchange for a rent reduction.</li><li>Offer to do something that raises the value of the property, like repainting the walls.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-state-how-good-you-ve-been-as-a-tenant">5. <strong>State how good you’ve been as a tenant</strong></h3>



<p>If you and your roommate(s) have a great tenant track record, use it to your advantage. &nbsp;Bring up how you pay rent early, or how well you’ve taken care of the apartment. Landlords appreciate tenants who are non-disruptive, so remind them how trouble-free you’ve been and how you plan to continue in that way.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-learn-how-much-the-landlord-can-legally-increase-rent">6. <strong>Learn how much the landlord can legally increase rent</strong></h3>



<p>Get familiar with local and state laws about rent increase and lease renewal processes. Go over your current lease again, and check whether it mentions rent increase rates. This will help you go into rent negotiations being both well prepared and well informed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-timing-matters">7. <strong>Timing matters</strong></h3>



<p>Choose your timing well when it comes to rent increase negotiations. It&#8217;s advisable to negotiate rent during these times:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A few months before your lease expires &#8211; you can ask for a lease renewal in exchange for reduced rent.</li><li>During winter. Winter is a slow period for landlords since people move more during warmer months. They may be more willing to consider your case if they can&#8217;t find new tenants.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-be-calm">8. <strong>Be calm</strong></h3>



<p>Remember that your landlord probably has reasons for a rent increase. Being rude or lashing out while trying to negotiate won’t play out well for you. You have to be calm, patient, and respectful, so you don’t risk causing an even larger divide between you and your landlord.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-put-the-deal-in-writing">9. <strong>Put the deal in writing</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/VFYJXIuuFl6pO" title="writing"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Deals put down in writing have more value, and can’t be easily broken. If your rent negotiations turn out successful, it doesn’t hurt to have it in writing &#8211; signed by both you and your landlord. It may be in your lease renewal document or additional paperwork. Wherever it is, it’ll help you avoid legal issues down the line.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-if-you-don-t-want-to-talk-directly-you-can-write-a-hardship-letter">10. If you don’t want to talk directly, you can write a hardship letter</h3>



<p>Another alternative you can try is writing a hardship letter. With this letter, you can explain your financial situation and the burden a rent increase would cause for you and/or your roommate(s). Write the letter as though you&#8217;re in a real conversation, and properly state your case. You can even use some of the tips above, like mentioning that you&#8217;re a good tenant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Renting after an eviction is not the easiest thing in the world. Though it is stressful, you can get through it with the right direction. It is important to embrace the situation and know that you are not alone. As a matter of fact, evictions are quite common, especially in the US.</p>



<p>Matthew Desmond, Professor in the Department of Sociology at Princeton University and author of the book <em>Evicted</em>, estimates that there are roughly <a href="https://en.as.com/en/2021/08/06/latest_news/1628249054_768663.html">one million evictions</a> in a typical year in the US.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has put more US renters at risk than ever before. Due to the pandemic, making rent got harder, leading to stimulus plans to supplement income and legislation that prevents evictions.</p>



<p>Now with things getting better, laws preventing evictions are being struck down, causing an unprecedented rise in evictions.</p>



<p>Regardless of the reason behind the eviction, it’s important to know what steps to take to be able to qualify for your next apartment.</p>



<p>In this blog, we will discuss how to get an apartment with an eviction on your record.</p>



<p>But before we dive into that, let’s dive deeper into how COVID-19 has affected evictions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="evictions-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Evictions During the Coronavirus Outbreak</h2>



<p>COVID-19 hit the economy in ways that no one could have predicted. This is why many states and cities implemented eviction moratoriums for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 Eviction Moratorium is a temporary rule that limits the amount of rent increases that landlords can give their tenants after a tenant has been evicted. The law is designed to help tenants who have been evicted from their homes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="660" height="441" data-attachment-id="18959" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-approval-renting-after-eviction/attachment/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?fit=660%2C441&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="660,441" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?fit=660%2C441&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?resize=660%2C441&#038;ssl=1" alt="evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak" class="wp-image-18959" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?w=660&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/evictions-during-coronavirus-outbreak.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure></div>



<p>It requires landlords to provide a COVID-19 Notice to a tenant before applying for a rent increase. The law also requires landlords to wait at least 30 days before applying for a rent increase after giving a COVID-19 Notice.</p>



<p>With the eviction moratoriums coming to an end post-pandemic, evictions are rising in the US at a greater pace than ever before. And hence, more people are faced with the situation of renting an apartment after an eviction.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="guide-to-renting-after-an-eviction">Guide to Renting After an Eviction</h2>



<p>Whether it&#8217;s eviction due to financial reasons, ending of the COVID moratorium, or breaking rules in your old home, here’s how to get an apartment again.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-1-talk-to-your-previous-landlord">Step #1 &#8211; Talk to your previous landlord.</h3>



<p>Renting after an eviction will be much easier if you make amends with your previous landlord. Whatever the reason for eviction was, there are ways to fix it. Before you start going through apartment listings, ask your landlord if they can remove the eviction from your rental history. They might agree to help you out if you find a proper way to settle the dispute.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-2-pay-off-debts">Step #2 &#8211; Pay off debts.</h3>



<p>From a landlord’s perspective, the biggest concern is getting paid at the end of the month. So, to ease your landlord&#8217;s mind, always have a clean credit report. This is especially important if you are renting after an eviction. Evictions and failing to pay debt can lower your credit score by hundreds of points. A good credit score is 670 and above. Start rebuilding your credit score by paying your bills on time and in full. You’ll also want to be conscious of your spending.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-3-prepare-good-references">Step #3: Prepare good references.</h3>



<p>Because you&#8217;re renting after an eviction, you’ll need to take a few extra steps to prove to your next landlord that you’re going to be a reliable tenant. Solid references can help you get a job; they can also help you rent an apartment following an eviction. Previous landlords or past employers are good sources for referrals that can demonstrate you’re a responsible, trustworthy person.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-4-seek-a-co-signer">Step #4: Seek a co-signer.</h3>



<p>If someone you know has a good rental and credit history, you might be able to persuade them to co-sign your lease for a new apartment. Of course, the co-signer will have to cover the rent if you’re unable to do so. Be careful with this! If the co-signer isn’t able to make rental payments, you could wind up evicted again.</p>

	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-5-look-for-apartments-with-eviction-forgiveness">Step #5: Look for apartments with eviction forgiveness.</h3>



<p>A great way for renting after an eviction is to narrow your search to those that are eviction-friendly. These apartments might have landlords that don’t run or require credit or eviction checks. These landlords are often local to the area and smaller in scale, with a couple of private units rather than a large apartment corporation.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="step-6-be-honest">Step #6: Be honest.</h3>



<p>Finally, it is important for you to be honest and answer all questions. In some cases, a landlord may be willing to overlook an eviction on a potential renter’s history if the renter is honest about what happened. For example, if you were in a difficult situation, such as job loss or a divorce, the landlord may be more understanding as to why you weren’t able to pay your rent.</p>

<p>What do you do when your landlord decides to increase the rent amount? Do you try to negotiate or do you just let it go? Rent negotiation might be scary concept, but it can save you stress (and money) in the long run. In this guide, we&#8217;ve set out 8 handy tips for how to negotiate a rent decrease. But first, let&#8217;s take a look at some of the benefits of negotiating rent.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-benefits-of-negotiating-rent">What are the benefits of negotiating rent?</h2>



<p>The main benefit of negotiating rent is that it can save you money. Your rent is probably your biggest monthly expense, so by negotiating a rent decrease, you&#8217;ll free up a bit of extra cash. This has the added benefit of allowing you to start saving for your future. When it&#8217;s done right, negotiating rent can also mark the beginning of a budding cordial relationship between you and your landlord.</p>



<p>You may find rent negotiation a daunting prospect, but it&#8217;s worth it for these long term benefits. Remember that you may not be successful at first. But, by following these 8 tips, you&#8217;ll have a better chance of securing a rent decrease.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-negotiate-rent-as-a-new-tenant">How to Negotiate Rent as a New Tenant</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re a new tenant, you&#8217;ll need to think about both sides during your negotiation. Contrary to popular belief, negotiating isn&#8217;t always about winning. The other person has to feel like they&#8217;re getting something out of it, too. Think of things your landlord would value in exchange for reducing your rent.</p>



<p>You should consider these ideas when trying to negotiate rent:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Committing to a longer lease is a strong negotiating factor. This works best if you can see yourself staying in that apartment for a while. For example, if the current lease is for a year, you can offer to sign a two-year lease in exchange for a reduced rent. Landlords may appreciate this as looking for new tenants is a time consuming process for them.</li><li>If you can offer to pay your rent a few months in advance, rent reduction negotiations may end in your favor.</li><li>You can also offer to end your lease during summertime, which is a peak renting period. During the summer, a lot of people tend to search for new apartments. So, offering to end the lease during this period may make your landlord more amenable.</li><li>Find terms in the lease you can use to your advantage. For instance, let&#8217;s say you don&#8217;t own a pet, but your rental allows them. For landlords, cleaning an apartment previously owned by a pet-owning resident costs more time and money. Mention that you don&#8217;t own a pet, so the landlord doesn&#8217;t have to spend as much on cleaning after you move out.</li></ul>



<p>You can brainstorm other ideas you feel are suitable, just make sure your landlord is also getting something of value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-negotiate-rent-as-an-existing-tenant">How to Negotiate Rent as an Existing Tenant</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re a current tenant and your landlord decides to make changes to your rent, then how do you go about it negotiating a rent decrease? Here are 8 tips on how to negotiate rent as an existing tenant:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-1-do-your-research">Tip #1: Do your research</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll need to research similar properties in your neighborhood. This will help you compare rent prices before you begin negotiations. If the prices are more or less the same, then it may be a bit harder for you to negotiate. However, if you notice that less rent is paid by other tenants, you can use that information to support your case.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-2-write-a-great-negotiation-request-letter-but-negotiate-in-person">Tip #2: Write a great negotiation request letter, but negotiate in person</h2>



<p>Sending your landlord a well-written letter about negotiating a lower rent could help your cause. The letter may not do the trick on its own, but a direct appeal might make reaching your goal easier. In your letter, be sure to point out that you&#8217;re open to more discussions, which you&#8217;d be happy to attend in person. This is because it&#8217;s tougher to say no to someone face to face, rather than over the phone.</p>



<p>The letter should be persuasive, but above all, honest, as it may affect your landlord&#8217;s decision.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-3-do-it-at-the-right-time">Tip #3: Do it at the right time</h2>



<p>Timing is everything. If you try to negotiate rent at the wrong time, you may not be successful in negotiating a rent decrease. Be sure to begin negotiations some months before your current lease expires, so that your landlord will not sense that you&#8217;re in a hurry. It&#8217;s also advisable to negotiate during slower seasons of the year, like winter. Trying to strike a deal during summer, when there&#8217;s high demand, may not work out so well for you.</p>



<p>Equally, you want to negotiate rent when you know you can stay on longer. Landlords may be more willing to negotiate if they know they won&#8217;t have to look for another tenant for a while.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-4-be-well-prepared">Tip #4: Be well prepared</h2>



<p>You won&#8217;t get what you&#8217;re after without a solid game plan. Make sure you have a precise strategy and know exactly what you hope to achieve. This is one of the best ways to negotiate rent. A good way to be prepared is by having important documents on hand to help you build your case. You can bring up your previous rent payment record and your credit score. References from previous landlords will also help you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-5-show-the-landlord-that-you-mean-business">Tip #5: Show the landlord that you mean business</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:100%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/q9lXWZcBX3Te0qCI1x" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/PBSSoCal-pbs-socal-actors-on-variety-studio-q9lXWZcBX3Te0qCI1x"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Paying rent in advance is a strong motivator for the right landlord. It will show that you&#8217;re serious, especially if you plan on signing a long-term lease. However, paying rent in advance depends on where you live, as some state laws don&#8217;t allow this.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-6-focus-on-small-negotiations">Tip #6: Focus on small negotiations</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t start negotiations by asking for too much off your rent upfront. Try to bargain for smaller reductions that won&#8217;t scare the landlord away.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-7-mentioning-your-good-track-record">Tip #7: Mentioning your good track record</h2>



<p>If you know you&#8217;ve been a good tenant, you can point that out. Include how well you pass your apartment searches and how you always pay rent on time/early. You can also point out that you haven&#8217;t violated any lease terms. No landlord wants to deal with a bad tenant, so mentioning all your good qualities may help seal the deal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-8-consider-the-counteroffer-possibilities-and-know-when-to-let-go">Tip #8: Consider the counteroffer possibilities and know when to let go</h2>



<p>Very rarely will the person you&#8217;re negotiating with agree to your first offer. Be prepared for counteroffers when trying to negotiate a rent decrease.</p>



<p>If you find a counteroffer that you&#8217;re good with, then you can go ahead and close the deal. However, if you can&#8217;t agree with the price your landlord is offering, then walk away.</p>



<p>We hope this list has been helpful in explaining how to negotiate rent with your landlord. Our advice is not to fret. Start by doing your research, write a rent negotiation letter, then utilize these tips during the negotiations process. The most important thing is to be prepared all the way through. Best of luck to you!</p>

<p>Think you&#8217;ve found the right apartment? Congratulations! We know the hunt can be tough, and we bet you&#8217;re ready to settle into your new place now. At this point, you&#8217;ll need to sign a lease agreement with the property manager or landlord. Among other things, this should cover your rent payment plan. While you might never need to use this, it can offer peace of mind in case any financial difficulties pop up in the future.</p>



<p>The rent payment plan kicks into action if you default on your rent payments, or are unable to make payments temporarily. If you don&#8217;t have one, and it happens that you can&#8217;t pay rent for any reason, you need to talk to your landlord or property manager about a rent arrears repayment plan. Failing to do this could lead to eviction.</p>



<p>However, having a conversation with your landlord or property manager about a rent repayment plan ensures you&#8217;ll still have a roof over your head while you get your finances back on track.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-a-rent-payment-plan">What is a rent payment plan?</h2>



<p>A rent payment plan is a kind of payment pledge in which the tenant commits to make a series of rent or debt payments. This comes into play if you owe money on your rent. Payment plans allow tenants a chance to avoid legal action by consenting to pay a portion of past-due rent each month until the payment is complete. Best of all? Tenants get to stay in their apartment and landlords know they&#8217;ll get up-to-date on what they owe.</p>

<p>We absolutely recommend having a rent arrears repayment plan in place, to protect against overdue rent payments you can&#8217;t afford. A rent payment plan allows you to pay back your rent in installments until you can clear the backlog. This varies from one landlord and property manager to another.</p>



<p>However that works out for you, it means you get to stay in your apartment for longer. The good news is you won&#8217;t have to worry so much about not being able to pay rent. At least until you find a way around it.</p>

<p>There are several options to consider when it comes to rent payment plans. What you settle for will depend on your financial situation and what makes both you and your property manager comfortable. Let&#8217;s take a look at the usual options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-paying-a-lump-sum-at-an-agreed-date">1. Paying a lump sum at an agreed date</h3>



<p>You can agree to pay a lump sum to cover all your owed rent at a set date. In the meantime, you&#8217;ll have a chance to build your savings for a month or two, so you can meet the target.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-making-payments-in-installments">2. Making payments in installments</h3>



<p>When you choose the rent installments plan, any money you owe is spread out over an agreed period. The time for repayment is usually longer. As compensation for the extra time, the landlord adds interest to the rent installment. The only drawback of this rent payment plan is the fact that you&#8217;ll pay back higher than you owed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-paying-at-the-end-of-your-lease">3. Paying at the end of your lease</h3>



<p>You can choose to defer any rent you owe until the end of your lease period. This is even better if you&#8217;ll be getting back your security deposit in full. You can ask your property manager or landlord to use the security deposit to cover the repayment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-hybrid-plan">4. Hybrid plan</h3>



<p>You can merge elements from the rent arrears repayment plans we already mentioned. For example, you could pay back some parts as rent installments and then choose to cover the rest as a lump sum.</p>



<p>Otherwise, you could pay a big chunk of the amount you owe and leave the rest until the expiration of your lease.</p>

<p>Really, there&#8217;s no reason <em>not</em> to ask for a rent payment plan.</p>



<p>If your landlord or property manager doesn&#8217;t initiate the move, make sure you do. Consider your situation and propose a rent payment plan that&#8217;s right for you.</p>



<p>A rent payment plan considers your financial limitations to put together a strategy. This means you&#8217;ll be able to pay your rent, whatever challenges get in the way.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#8217;re an up-and-coming college student going to university in a new city or a young professional moving into the corporate world in a different town. Either way, we&#8217;ve all heard stories of potential renters getting scammed online.</p>



<p>With rental scams on the rise, we understand your fear of encountering real estate fraud when looking for rooms to rent. To avoid becoming a victim of it yourself, read on for everything you need to know about rental property scams. We&#8217;ll cover how to spot one, what to do if you do get scammed, and how to prevent it from happening again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-rental-scams-and-how-do-they-happen">What are rental scams, and how do they happen?</h2>

<p>In simple terms, rental property scams are fake ads or properties posted as genuine listings on websites. Most of the time, a phony listing has noticeable qualities. The problem is, if you don&#8217;t know what to look out for, you could be tricked. If in doubt, here are some of the things you should look out for when browsing for apartments to avoid rental scams.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="incomplete-listing-details">Incomplete listing details</h3>



<p>As with any website, it&#8217;s always good practice to check if all the essential details have been posted. Accurate spelling, grammar and punctuation also matters, because serious landlords take time to create a description that people will <em>actually</em> be interested in. So, if the listing is lacking information or has lots of errors, it&#8217;s could well be a rental fraud.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-price-is-too-good-to-be-true">The price is too good to be true</h3>



<p>If you see a property being sold for a &#8216;<em>steal</em> &#8216; **or a price below its market rate, it&#8217;s probably a scam. In these situations, the best thing to do is to check other listings of the same size, location, and services and compare the prices.</p>



<p>However, this doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean cheap listings are always fraudulent. The owner may not be up-to-date with current rental prices, or perhaps the place has some downsides to it. Whatever the reason for the low listing price, it pays to do your research.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="having-to-pay-many-potential-tenant-fees">Having to pay many &#8216;potential tenant fees&#8217;</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s common for landlords to do background checks on their potential tenants, but some charge excessive fees for it (or even add unnecessary charges!). Typically, a background check can cost around <a href="https://www.scoutlogicscreening.com/blog/what-is-the-cost-of-a-background-check">$10 to $50</a> depending on the type of search. If a landlord tries to charge you a lot more than that, it may be cause for suspicion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-owner-won-t-allow-you-to-visit-the-property">The owner won&#8217;t allow you to visit the property</h3>



<p>Not being allowed to view the apartment in person before making a deal should be an immediate red flag. As a potential tenant, you need to see your new digs to know whether you&#8217;d be happy to live there or not.</p>



<p>There are many reasons owners don&#8217;t allow visits:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The property doesn&#8217;t exist and they&#8217;re just out to get your money.</li>



<li>The apartment has already been rented out to someone else.</li>



<li>The apartment looks nothing like the pictures that were posted.</li>
</ol>

<p>The owner may also make excuses for not having the keys or access to the property while insisting on payment (e.g. a deposit to reserve the apartment) right away. Then, once they receive the money, they disappear.</p>



<p>In general, scammers have one goal: to steal your money. But by looking out for anything that seems odd or suspicious, you can avoid becoming a victim of rental property scams.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to recognize rental frauds, here are some extra tips to stop you being caught out in future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-constantly-communicate-with-the-owner-or-landlord">1. Constantly communicate with the owner or landlord</h3>



<p>Sending a message to a potential landlord is easy, but constantly keeping up a conversation with them about the property can be difficult. Some don&#8217;t reply well or are just not good with virtual discussions. So, it&#8217;s best to initiate a phone call instead or to personally meet with your landlord.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also helpful to have a list of questions ready to ask the owner, whether over the phone or in person. This way, you&#8217;ll be able to see if they&#8217;re fully informed about the apartment &#8211; anything less can be potentially suspicious.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-visit-the-property-in-person-before-signing-anything">2. Visit the property in person before signing anything</h3>



<p>If the apartment is listed as being only five minutes away from the grocery store or subway, visiting the property will tell you whether the advert is accurate. More than that, you can meet with the owner, scout the location, and talk with other tenants (or potential neighbors!)</p>



<p>By personally seeing the place, you can get a feel of how the apartment would work for you. You&#8217;d be able to see how far it is from your work or university, and most importantly, you can learn more from people who live nearby. Ask about the neighborhood and if they like living there &#8211; maybe even ask about your potential landlord!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-do-your-own-research">3. Do your own research</h3>



<p>Browsing for a place requires a lot of effort, but to ensure you&#8217;re safe from rental scams you should always do your own research too. Learn more about the place, the landlord, and even the website you&#8217;re using to find apartments.</p>



<p>Doing a quick search of the address can help you check if it&#8217;s a real place, or something made up by the scammer. You can also search the landlord&#8217;s name on the website to see if there are any reviews under their names. If there aren&#8217;t any or they&#8217;re pretty negative, you may want to think twice about contacting them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-trust-your-instincts">4. Trust your instincts</h3>



<p>If you get a bad feeling at any point during the process of renting a place, <strong>trust your gut</strong>.</p>



<p>Maybe the owner said something strange, or the place just doesn&#8217;t feel right with you, or maybe the area isn&#8217;t like it was described. Nonetheless, listen to what your mind and instincts are telling you because most of the time, they are right.</p>

<li><strong>Contact the website&#8217;s support team.</strong> Most websites have a help center or support team that can help you once you reach out to them. With Roomi, for instance, you can submit a report or contact the team directly. This way, they can quickly take down the phony listing.</li>



<li><strong>Report to the local authorities.</strong> The local authorities can help you track and identify the scammer to prevent anything fraudulent from happening again.</li>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been planning a move to or are looking for rooms for rent in Austin, you should know you&#8217;re in for a good time. In 2019, Austin was voted as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2019/05/31/is-austin-texas-the-best-city-in-america/?sh=496a233c65c5">the best place to live in America</a> for the third time in a row. In 2020, it was the second-best place to live in America. Now, if that&#8217;s not telling of how much people love the place and how much it has to offer to the people who choose to call it home, then what is?</p>



<p>But on a serious note, as with everything in life, picking a neighborhood to rent a room in Austin should also depend on a bunch of factors. But mostly, it should be a decision based on what you&#8217;re into. Here are some factors to put things into perspective.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Austin</h2>



<p>The phrase, &#8220;Everything is bigger in Texas,&#8221; never gets old. But for everyone who is still considering finding rooms for rent in Austin, you should know that this phrase very well applies to the heat as well. Austin’s weather is amazing 10 months out of the year, and there’s barely a winter to speak of. But when July and August come around, you’ll see temps reaching 100+ degrees. Luckily, Austin has its fair share of public pools and swimming holes that you can take advantage of!</p>

<p>And if at all you&#8217;re a music fan, we don&#8217;t need to say much because you might already be aware of how crazy the music scene in Austin can be! Every March, hundreds of thousands of people invade the city for its annual music, film, and interactive conference and festival, <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sxsw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South by Southwest</a></strong> (SXSW, or just “South by” to locals). The other behemoth music fest is Austin City Limits (ACL), where many acts get their big break. All your favorite bands will stop in Austin on tour, every single one!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top Neighborhoods in Austin, TX </h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>North Loop:</strong> Think 1992, but with better pizza. North Loop is the ultimate intersection of working-class meets bohemian cohort. Its defining characteristic is its namesake street, which winds through the middle of the neighborhood. The small commercial stretch—codified at some point as the North Loop IBIZ District—contains several surprisingly long-lived local vintage and record stores, coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and such requisite oddities as the quirky convenience store, the anarchist bookshop, and the women-owned adult-toy shop.</li><li><strong>Cherry Wood:</strong> This is the ultimate special find if you&#8217;re looking for that for your next rental place in Austin. The vibe here is laid back as the laid back can be. With the gigantic shade trees, winding streets, and French place names (so many that it’s sometimes called French Place), East Austin’s Cherrywood neighborhood has a slightly Southern character. You’ll find bungalows and other small, wood-frame homes; Craftsman-style houses large and small; and one- and two-story stucco homes, many originally built for families of returning soldiers after World War II.</li><li><strong>South Menchaca</strong> Every Austinite that was done with the over-touristy nature the city quickly took over or was just simply priced out of areas of South Austin are finding community and hometown friendliness, much lower home prices, and a less hectic pace by moving just a little farther south. South Menchaca is one of the neighborhoods attracting such seekers; it’s close to those attractions when the mood hits, and more low-key, neighborly bars and shops are popping up all around!</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Average Rent in Austin, TX</h2>



<p>If we&#8217;re being honest, neighborhoods can be sensitive, organic entities, highly affected by the built and natural environments as well as by those who live there—and those who leave.</p>



<p>There’s no denying that Austin is booming. Transplants continue to move here in record numbers, thus affecting the average price of the rooms for rent in Austin, Tx. But the inventory is low, and the rental market is tight. At the same time, some longtime Austinites, overwhelmed by the transformation of their neighborhoods or just seeking a change, are on the move. So here are some numbers to put things into perspective.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rooms for Rent in Austin, TX </strong></td><td><strong>Average Rent</strong></td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://bit.ly/2PyLdQN" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">1 Bedroom Apartment in Austin, TX</a></td><td>$909</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://bit.ly/3t2nS7Q" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">2 Bedroom Apartment in Austin, TX</a></td><td>$1,716</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://bit.ly/3vzD65X" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">3 Bedroom Apartment in Austin, TX</a></td><td>$2,325</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University life in Austin, TX</h2>



<p>Some of the reasons why students turn to Austin are the bustling entrepreneurial spirit, Austin&#8217;s commitment to personal freedom, and a passion for unearthing new discoveries. Add to this a vibrant, internationally renowned music, film, and art scene, along with a thriving economy that leads the way in the technology, engineering, and health care industries. Keeping this in mind, let&#8217;s move on to the top universities in Austin, TX.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of Texas at Austin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.txstate.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas State University</a></li><li><a href="https://www.southuniversity.edu/austin" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">South University &#8211; Austin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stedwards.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saint Edward&#8217;s University</a></li><li><a href="https://www.concordia.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concordia University &#8211; Texas</a></li></ul>



<p>Let&#8217;s now consider the cost of living in Austin as a student. As of 2021, a single person estimated monthly costs of living in Austin are 834.08$ without rent.</p>



<p>Although food, drinks, rent, and housing are going to be cheaper than New York or California prices, Austin still holds its own in terms of cost of living. It&#8217;s always good to remember that even if you&#8217;re able to find inexpensive rooms for rent in Austin, Tx, and you’ll still be spending on things like transportation, delicious meals at can’t-miss restaurants, and entertainment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Transit Friendly is Austin, Texas?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Walkability</h3>



<p>While not considered the most walkable city in the U.S. (Austin is the 29th most walkable large city in the US with a “walk score” of 41 out of 100), Austin is home to several neighborhoods that are more pedestrian-friendly than others.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Traffic</h3>



<p>The constant influx of residents is putting a hurt on the city’s infrastructure. There are only two main arteries for commuting (I-35 and the TX-1 Loop aka MoPac), so peak hours are pretty miserable. No joke—it will take you 30 minutes to go three miles. If possible, find a job before you find a place to live and plan your commute accordingly. Those with jobs downtown will find that it is well worth it to spend the extra dough to be closer to work, as the bus system (CapMetro) is the only viable public transportation option for Austin residents.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Taxis and Rideshares </h3>



<p>Taxis and rideshares for an integral part of Austin&#8217;s economy as well as the people&#8217;s happiness. Besides the most common Uber and Lyft, that came back to Austin after a long Hiatus just last year, there are some Austinite favorites including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="http://www.rideaustin.com/" class="broken_link">RideAustin</a></li><li><a href="https://www.vonlane.com/">Vonlane</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ResponsibleRide/">Responsible Ride</a></li><li><a href="https://www.supershuttle.com/locations/Austin-Aus/">SuperShuttle of Austin</a></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Public Transport</h3>



<p>Austin&#8217;s public Capital Metro Bus System serves a population of more than 1 million in its 535-square mile service area. With a system of more than 1,600 bus stops and 82 routes, Central Texas is served by local, MetroRapid limited-stop, MetroFlyer, MetroExpress, and University of Texas Shuttle routes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cycling</h3>



<p>With numerous hills, elaborate trails, specialist shops, and cyclist-friendly laws, Austin is an ideal city for bike enthusiasts.</p>



<p>It is ranked as the seventh-best cycling city in America by Bicycle Magazine and offers an abundance of fun trails, stocked shops, and eclectic communities devoted to cycling. Whether you&#8217;re training for the Tour de France, scaling limestone walls on your new Trek, looking to start a fixie gang, or simply using your two-wheeler to commute — Austin&#8217;s got you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nightlife in Austin</h2>



<p>There are hundreds of bars in Austin, one for everyone&#8217;s taste! The legendary 6th St bar scene has spilled onto nearby thoroughfares, especially Red River St. Many of the 6th St places are shot bars aimed at college students and tourists, while the Red River establishments retain a harder local edge. A few blocks south, Rainey St is also jumping, with old bungalows now home to watering holes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Food in Austin</h2>



<p>Everyone knows Austin’s reputation as a music town, but these days the Texas capital is just as renowned for its food, which features both traditional Texan flavors and dishes that confound stereotypical expectations. Austin has a reputation as a welcoming, friendly place, but like New Yorkers over pizza, Austinites may come damn near throwing a punch if you take issue with their choice of brisket smoker or breakfast taco maker. Local specialties like that are just the beginning of the food conversation in the Texas capital though.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll find everything you want, and then some more. So, here are some of our favorite Austin restaurants!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How transit friendly is New York City?</strong></h2>



<p>If you depend on your two feet, then New York City is super transit friendly. Because you need to walk&#8230; a lot! But the funnies aside, NYC boasts of one of the largest subway systems of the world, along with a bus service that allows travel within boroughs, and a commuter rail to connect the main city areas to the suburbs.</p>



<p>Keep the <a href="http://tripplanner.mta.info/MyTrip/ui_web/customplanner/TripPlanner.aspx">MTA trip planner</a> handy whether you want information on subways, trains or buses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Subways</strong></h3>



<p>You wouldn&#8217;t believe it, but riding the subway in NYC can be a profound cultural experience that can help you get familiar with all that is characteristic of New York City. Apart from political activism, you can also find musicians and ensembles give performances sanctioned by New York City Transit, under the Music Under New York program, at a few dozen locations throughout the subway system!</p>



<p><strong>So here are all your hacks to the city&#8217;s subway system while you find rooms for rent in NYC: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hacks-to-the-subway-in-nyc-we-all-need/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hacks to the subway in NYC we all need.</a></strong></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Is Los Angeles cycle friendly?</h3>



<p>L.A. used to be the worst cycling city, but it has changed significantly. It has made way for the cyclist lifestyle in several neighborhoods such as Venice, West Los Angeles and West Adams. These neighborhoods offer bike lanes, helpful routes, scenic bike paths, and even bicycle parking and amenities.</p>

<p>The natural moving out of your parents&#8217; home, and renting a house for the first time is very exciting. It comes with its own sense of freedom but also a remarkable set of responsibilities. These are the responsibilities that become an integral part of anyone&#8217;s adulthood. Being a first-time renter, then we can say, is a very big deal.</p>



<p>When the freedom of doing whatever you want, whenever you want it confluences with responsibilities like paying your own bills for services like utilities, that you are not used to paying for, becomes a grand juggling act for most. But the best part of most of these situations is the part when you find yourself figuring out patterns that work well for <em>you.</em></p>



<p>We&#8217;re here to help you make the transition (somewhat) easier. These are just some basic tips, that if remembered correctly, can be integral in making the transition as smooth as possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Budgeting is your best friend as a first time renter.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.pexels.com/photos/4778621/pexels-photo-4778621.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="Woman in White Long Sleeve Shirt Sitting Beside Woman in Red Shirt As They Are Are All Renting A House For The First Time"/></figure>



<p>Saving is going to be your best friend, no matter what stage of life you are in. And at a time when you&#8217;re a first-time mover, putting together an apartment budget can help you in ways none of us can anticipate beforehand. Continuing and keeping up with the budget you create even after you have settled in is a wonderful way of making up for those days when making rent can be a little tougher. Additionally, unprecedented house costs like a small repair, a necessary home item, and more.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>The golden rule of saving says you must never spend more than you can afford on your living &#8211; this is often accomplished by abiding by the 50/30/20 rule. Spend no more than 30% of your total income on rent.</p></blockquote>



<p>And finally, remember to include all of your monthly living expenses in your budget &#8211; and make sure to add a bracket for unexpected costs as well. Starting out with a roommate will also allow you to split some essentials, thus helping you save further.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Listing your needs can create a lot of clarity when renting a house for the first time.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.pexels.com/photos/4778622/pexels-photo-4778622.jpeg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="Woman in Red Long Sleeve Shirt Sitting on Chair With Her Roommates As A First Time Renter"/></figure>



<p>This checklist will basically get you through the apartment scouting process, and without it, the whole process would be as crazy as one can imagine. Here&#8217;s where understanding the difference between your apartment needs vs apartment wants also comes into play. </p>



<p>Your needs are your must-haves, those that you absolutely cannot do without when renting a house for the first time.</p>



<p> For instance, if you don&#8217;t own a car, you might want to find a place within walking distance of public transport. Similarly, those that have a pet would want to consider a place that a) allows pets and b) has the kind of space needed for you and your fur buddy.</p>



<p>What you <em>want</em> on your list are those things that would essentially be the cherry on top of your ideal home. Maybe you want a gym within the apartment complex, or uh, chrome finishes ?.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Taking a tour of the place is helpful for one too many reasons.</h2>



<p>While the pandemic pushed most of us into viewing and reviewing everything online, a good old-fashioned tour will shine light on those aspects that you wouldn&#8217;t think of reviewing a place online. An unwritten rule of moving into a new place is scouting the neighborhood, so you get a sense of the layout, what&#8217;s really close by and what isn&#8217;t, the neighborhood community, the amenities around your place, etc.</p>



<p>Make sure to ask all questions to the property manager. Nothing you come up with is unessential considering you are thinking of <em>moving in. </em></p>



<p><em>Some examples include the following:</em></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>When is the neighborhood at its loudest/quietest?</li><li>What are the property rules for pets?</li><li>When is trash collected?</li><li>What are the water hours, if any?</li><li>What the parking situation is like?</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Talk to a fellow renter.</h2>



<p>It is always recommended to speak with a pre-existing renter in the area that you might be narrowing down on. The logic is simple yet effective, they&#8217;re already living in the complex/neighborhood you are looking at and they pretty much will tell you the ins &amp; outs as well as the quirks of the place, if any.</p>



<p>You can bring up the same questions to them as you did with the property manager, to figure out any inconsistencies, and verify the actual value of your place.</p>
