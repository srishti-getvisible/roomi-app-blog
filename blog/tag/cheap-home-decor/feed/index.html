<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting started</h2>



<p>Before you step out and spend those precious dollars, here are a few things to keep in mind. You will need to shell out some cash to decorate your off-campus housing. Hence, be sure that what you buy is going to fit your student apartment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="12924" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/decorate-off-campus-housing-on-a-budget/attachment/home-decor-couch-cushion/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2560,1707" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="home-decor-couch-cushion" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="a grey couch with blue cushions" class="wp-image-12924" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Budget</h3>



<p>It can be easy to get carried away while decorating your off campus housing. Dorms and campus housing may have restrictions when it comes to decoration or modifications. However, off campus housing is a lot more flexible. Be sure that you set a budget and do not spend on unnecessary items or furniture. Remember you can always buy something later if you still feel that you really want it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Available space</h3>



<p>Do you really need that 50 inch T.V. or that huge fluffy rug? Don&#8217;t get carried away when you shop. And be realistic. Make sure what you buy will actually fit in your off campus housing, and is practical. There is still a lot you can do if you are working with a small space. However, be sure you don&#8217;t overdo it and end up with a cluttered apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pets</h3>



<p>Having a pet is a commitment that you need to take seriously. Thus, be sure that you have your furry friend in mind while decorating and furnishing your off campus housing. Make sure that you are creating an environment that is safe and comfortable for your pet. Also, keep in mind that you need a place for your pet to sleep and relieve themselves! Shedding can also be something that you need to plan for, to avoid a mess. Fragile decorations on open shelves can also be a disaster. Ask yourself if the things you are buying are going to be a problem.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Aesthetic</h3>



<p>It is easy to see something pretty and spring for it in the spur of the moment. However, do consider if what you are buying will actually fit your aesthetic and that of your off campus housing. The last thing that you want, is to buy something and then realize that you really don&#8217;t like it that much. Hence, be sure to set the vibe you want to go for!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Practicality and mindfulness</h3>



<p>While you may really think that fancy ceramic shot glass set will really up your house party game, hold on. When you&#8217;re on a budget, be careful of your temptation to spring for fancier and more pricey versions of things. Don&#8217;t fall for marketing and end up going beyond your means! However, this doesn&#8217;t mean you should always buy cheaper and low-quality items. Being mindful is the key here. Before buying something, ask yourself. Is this going to add value to me or my space?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buying furniture</h2>



<p>If you are moving into an unfurnished off campus housing, then the first thing you&#8217;ll need to buy is furniture. Get started with a list of things you will need to furnish your off campus apartment. Make sure that you are getting everything and not less, and definitely not more. Again, remember, that mahogany shelf may look great in the corner, but do you really need it?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to get?</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s start off with the essentials. You will need a bed and mattress to start off. A solid and comfortable study desk and chair is also a good investment. Beyond this, it really depends on the size and nature of your off campus housing. If you are living in a studio apartment, you may want to keep it limited and only get a small couch or coffee table. However, if you are moving into a bigger space and sharing it, you may want to get a larger couch and table for your common spaces.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where to get it?</h3>



<p>For furniture, you may want to check out <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">IKEA</a>. This basically your one-stop shop for all your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/affordable-furniture-shops-when-living-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">furniture needs</a>! Other than this, you can visit local stores and look for deals as well. Buying used furniture online is also a great option. You can often find great deals on used furniture that can save you a decent buck. Remember, these are things that you will use regularly and need to last you a while. Hence, take your time and do your share of window shopping.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buying applicances and decoration</h2>



<p>After you&#8217;ve got yourself the essentials with a full set of furniture, appliances and accessories are next. This is the place where you should exercise your fair share of caution. It can be easy to splurge too much on these items. Be sure you are getting what you need, and that it adds value to your space and life.</p>

<p>Again, this can widely vary depending on your lifestyle and the size of your off campus housing. If you are going to be cooking at home, a fridge and stove are going to be essential. Beyond this, you can get a microwave, blender or oven depending on the kind of cooking you do. If you are going to be eating out or in your college mess, you may want to skip this all. Ask yourself if you need a television and if you and your flat mates are actually going to using it. When it comes to decoration, keep all the earlier tips in mind, and consult with your roommates if you have any.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where to get it?</h3>



<p>You can look to <a href="https://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart</a> or <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/?intl=nosplash" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Bestbuy</a> to find appliances and other decorations. They usually have a large selection and decent prices. You can also look to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> and easily find great deals online as well. Try <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Etsy</a> for handmade and more personalized decor and art. Again, be sure to check with local stores for deals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Have you been sitting at home staring at your blank wall, wondering what happened to your personal decor style? 2020 had most of us shut inside the same four walls for longer than we had ever imagined. Therefore, it does not come as a surprise that many of us are scavenging the internet for ways to declutter and revamp our shrines with new home decor ideas. And since the roaring 20s are back in style (along with economic depression), Roomi has a list of cheap home decor stores to save the day (and your pocket).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Home decor ideas for when you no longer have ideas</strong></h2>

In addition, lighter woods and materials like hemp and natural fabrics are in vogue, giving us that extra connection to nature right inside our homes.
