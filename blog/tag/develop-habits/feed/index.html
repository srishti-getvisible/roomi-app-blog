<p>They say that it takes 21 days to form habits. What! Just 21 days? So, that means change is possible! But when thinking about breaking a routine can make us feel like it&#8217;s an impossible journey, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been struggling with this for ten years. How will I ever overcome it?&#8221; The ultimate answer &#8211; you need to be super intentional. If you can consciously choose and have a challenge written out on a piece of paper to stick it in ten different places, you continuously remind yourself about it. Remember, it&#8217;s all about the small choices you make every day that can help you break bad habits. Even when they are bad eating habits like over eating and mindless snacking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9 Questions to ask yourself to determine the source of your bad eating habits!</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Are you a heavy snacker?</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/l44QwkaFyR4dqF2nK"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/l44QwkaFyR4dqF2nK/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C240&#038;ssl=1" alt="Yas Yes GIF by SkinnyPop - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="240" /></a></div>

<p>You could be overeating. A small healthy snack between meals is fine. Snacks can keep blood sugar steady. When you snack instead of having real meals, you are more likely to lose track of how much you are eating. Since a small serving of snacks is not that satisfying, it is easy to overeat.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to avoid getting &#8216;snacky&#8217;?</h4>



<p>To satisfy your hunger and keep your energy up, allow yourself to have two&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/cheap-and-healthy-snack-ideas-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-calorie snacks</a>&nbsp;a day of 100 to 300 calories each. Have something that feels like real food, e.g., half a sandwich, a handful of nuts, whole-grain crackers, baby carrots with hummus, or yogurt sprinkled with cereal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Are you a mindless muncher?</h3>



<p>It could be the telly or mindless Netflix binge, but people who eat while watching the TV can take in about 20 to 60% more. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to break this eating habit? </h4>



<p>Figure out your trigger situations and set limits on what you will eat. Help yourself with a single serving before you sit down on the couch, or delay your snack until you can pay attention. Minimize damage by dipping into low-cal foods, such as cut vegetables, air-popped popcorn, rice crackers, and whole-grain cereal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Do you eat your way out of a bad mood?</h3>

<p>Many people turn to carbs that produce tryptophan, a type of amino acid used by the brain to manufacture serotonin. With the brain making more serotonin, your mood temporarily improves. Feeding your fears and frustrations, instead of confronting them, can lead to a cycle of worse moods and steady weight gain.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The solution!</h4>



<p>Stop thinking about what&#8217;s bothering you. Try a nonfood mood booster, like walking, watching a movie, or calling a friend. If nothing else works, get your serotonin boost without triggering a binge. Go for a whole-grain treat to get more fiber and less sugar.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Do you eat all week carefully, but blow it over the weekend with your eating habits?</h3>



<p>It is possible to undo five days of good eating with weekend binges. If you are consistent in your eating habits, you are 1.5 times more likely to stay within five pounds of your weight than those who are vigilant only on weekdays.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Fix your eating habits with this ??</h4>



<p>Don&#8217;t severely restrict yourself from Monday to Friday to feel the need to indulge on weekends. You can strategize your weekend socializing by having a &#8220;mini-meal&#8221; before you go out. You can even offer to be the designated driver for the day to limit alcohol intake.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Do all your meals come in cans, bags, or boxes?</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>Most packaged foods can be sneaky sources of unhealthy fats, sugar, salt, and excess calories. Even a can of low-fat soup can contain more than half a day&#8217;s worth of sodium.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The solution!</h4>



<p>Be smart about it, not guilty for relying on packaged foods. Lower calorie or lower-sodium versions of frozen food can provide a quick controlled meal. Check labels to find the healthiest ones that are high in fiber and lower in salt, and have whole grains, nutrient-rich vegetables at the top of their ingredient lists. You can wrap up your meal with a piece of fruit or low-fat yogurt for dessert.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Do you eat on the run?</h3>



<p>You ignore what&#8217;s going into your mouth if you eat while driving, walking down the street, or shopping. It can mean an upset stomach and can leave you dissatisfied, unsure of what you ate that didn&#8217;t agree with you.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The solution!</h4>



<p>If you need to schedule a reminder, do it, but build time to eat into your day. When you don&#8217;t have the option,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi/1981/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come prepared</a>&nbsp;with a granola bar, nuts and dry fruits, and a single-serving packet of crackers. Store them in your bag, glove compartment of your car, or office drawer. Even fast-food joints are today offering healthy options for satisfying real food.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Are you a speed eater?</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:74%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/4Hvf4fVxJnYVE36QgB" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/4Hvf4fVxJnYVE36QgB/giphy.gif"></iframe>

<p>Gulping food makes you take in excess air, which can lead to bloating. Research says that it takes about 20 minutes for your brain to realize that your stomach is full. Consequently, a recent study concluded that women who ate within 30 minutes ate 10 percent fewer calories than those who finished their food in 10 minutes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Slow down with this eating habit!</h4>



<p>Avoid finger foods, and instead, choose items that require a plate to eat with utensils. Pause often, and&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-drink-more-water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drink water throughout meals</a>. Try to slow down.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Do you skip breakfast?</h3>



<p>Studies have shown that cognitive skills and memory improve once you&#8217;ve had breakfast. Blood sugar usually drops overnight, so the brain runs on empty until you eat in the morning. People who skip breakfast also lean on eating more calories during the day than do people who don&#8217;t.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The solution!</h4>



<p>If you are habitually short on time, you can stock&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.self.com/gallery/high-protein-breakfasts-that-arent-eggs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easy-to-make breakfast foods</a>. Keep packets of oatmeal handy in the office. Your breakfast need not be a drawn out affair, but you should aim to eat within an hour or two after getting up. Try to have around 250 &#8211; 400 calories and include at least one serving of whole grains, a protein source, and one serving of fruit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Is sugar your BFF?</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

<p>A sugary snack provides very few nutrients and is mostly empty calories. Too much sugar can make you obese but also undernourished. Sugar gives that high energy but will slump you down later. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s what you ought to do ??</h4>



<p>Unsweetened dried fruits, peanut M&amp;M&#8217;s, and a handful of lightly sweetened whole-grain cereal are all excellent swaps for candy or cookies. This way, you don&#8217;t have to go off the sweet stuff altogether. Read labels and seek out less-sugar or sugar-free versions of your favorite food. This is primarily the most important aspect of fixing bad eating habits!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Deep down, we know that looking away from our problems isn&#8217;t going to solve them. Somehow, we still continue to ignore our need to quit a bad habit. However, scientific studies say that might not entirely be our fault. Stop self-sabotaging today and kick your bad habits in the butt with these expert-proof mindfulness training exercises!</p>



<p>Psychiatrist and addiction expert Judson Brewer says our brain&#8217;s prefrontal cortex could be the culprit. While it is the part of the brain that becomes the voice that advises you against indulging in your bad habit, it is also the part of the brain that switches off and &#8216;looks away&#8217; in stressful situations. (Think about how you go for that cigarette or extra cookie, especially when you have a stressful situation at hand.)</p>



<p>That said, the blame game won&#8217;t get us far. If a habit is bothering you and even makes you prone to health risks (especially now), it&#8217;s time to give it up, right?</p>



<p>Sure, it&#8217;s easier said than done, but if you&#8217;ve accepted your need to quit a bad habit, you&#8217;ve already taken your first step towards breaking it!</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s a list of things you should start doing now to break free from the rusty chains of your bad habits and kick your bad habits once and for all.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/splat-nicksplat-roundhouse-l4EoSY9soGNPUtjy0"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/l4EoSY9soGNPUtjy0/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="Nicksplat Splat GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="360" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tip-1-to-kick-your-bad-habits-don-t-force-it-embrace-mindfulness">Tip #1 to kick your bad habits: Don&#8217;t force it. Embrace mindfulness.</h2>



<p>Judson Brewer in his <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/judson_brewer_a_simple_way_to_break_a_bad_habit/transcript?referrer=playlist-talks_to_form_better_habits" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TED talk</a> discusses his mindfulness training to quit smoking that he put to trial with a study group. He suggests you should <strong>stop forcing</strong> yourself to kick your bad habit in the butt. Try mindfulness training instead.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;With mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious. In fact, we even told them to smoke. What? Yeah, we said, &#8220;Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it&#8217;s like when you do.&#8221;</em> <strong>A response by one of the smokers:</strong> <em>&#8220;Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!&#8221;</em></p>



<p>This little exercise, he says, helps your experiential side of the brain to understand what your cognitive mind already knows: Not only is it bad for your health, it also makes you feel like crap. While the main focus of the experiment was to quit smoking, this same technique can be applied to whatever bad habit you may have.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tip-2-train-your-mind-with-reinforcement-amp-punishment-to-kick-your-bad-habits">Tip #2 Train your mind with reinforcement &amp; punishment to kick your bad habits</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever trained your dog or seen a friend train theirs, whenever the dog does something on command or doesn&#8217;t, they&#8217;re given a treat and called a good boy/girl or a bad boy/girl, respectively. Similarly you need to train your mind as well! Reinforce a positive action towards quitting your bad habit with a reward, and punish yourself for a relapse.</p>



<p>Although calling yourself a good <strong>insert gender</strong> won&#8217;t cut it. When you&#8217;re trying to quit a bad habit, pause, and think about the rewards and punishments that would work in your favor.</p>



<p>For example, if you&#8217;re trying to reduce your procrastination habits, reward yourself for getting work done with an hour of TV or your favorite activity post work. And if you end up procrastinating, punish yourself with no TV for 2 days.</p>



<p>The harsher (but implementable) your punishment is, the more likely you are to reach for the reward instead.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tip-3-don-t-expect-to-have-no-days-of-relapse">Tip #3 Don&#8217;t expect to have no days of relapse</h2>



<p>Remember that it’s completely normal and OK to fall back to bad habits once in a while when you&#8217;ve set your mind to quit. This is precisely why it&#8217;s so tough to let go of a bad habit successfully. Once you relapse, you think it&#8217;s over and stop thinking about quitting altogether. Don&#8217;t do that!</p>



<p>Remind yourself that things will not change overnight. So when you do relapse, think about the negative aspects of the bad habit that made you want to quit in the first place.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tip-4-try-the-x-effect-to-make-or-break-a-habit">Tip #4 Try the X effect to make or break a habit</h2>



<p>A very simple and effective activity that works to kick your bad habits is the <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">X effect</a>. Whether you&#8217;re trying to break a bad habit or build a good one, the X effect becomes proof of your successes as well as your failures. And the more you visualize your progress, the more likely you are to want to improve.</p>



<p>To start practising the X effect, simply make a month-long grid on a sheet of paper and mark each day that you work towards your goal with an X. Leave the grid empty for when you fail to do so.

<p>You know the emptiness you feel when something in your life suddenly ends? When you&#8217;re trying to quit a bad habit, you&#8217;ll feel this emptiness in the form of withdrawal. So thinking you&#8217;ll magically stop doing something will make you long for it more and more if you don&#8217;t have a rebound (good) habit ready to replace it. For example, if you&#8217;re trying to reduce the hours you spend on Netflix bingeing, take up a hobby you enjoy and replace those hours to practice it every day till it becomes your primary habit.</p>



<p>While you try these simple tips, remind yourself that growth, while being beautifully rewarding, is slow, which is why cultivating and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-develop-steady-habits-and-how-you-can-use-them-to-succeed/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintaining good habits</a> takes more effort than picking up bad habits.</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Why is so hard for us to develop steady habits when humans are by default, creatures of habit? We wake up, get out of bed, have our coffee, and begin our day the way we usually do. Why are we so accustomed to habits yet often unable to develop steady habits that help us succeed?</p>



<p>When the announcer said his name, Michael Phelps stepped on the starting block and stepped down just as he does before every swimming race. He swung his arms thrice like he has done before every race since he was twelve. Then he took his stand on the block, waiting for the gun to go off. </p>



<p>He immediately knew that something was wrong as water started to seep inside his swimming goggles. By the third and final lap, he could not see anything. Most swimmers would panic if they lost sight during an Olympics race. Not Michael Phelps.</p>



<p>He estimated the number of stroked needed to complete a lap &#8211; maybe nineteen or twenty or twenty-one. Midway through, he increased his effort to overwhelm his opponents. The crowd was cheering, but he had no idea who the cheers were for &#8211; him or someone else? On his twenty-first stroke, he glided to touch the wall and ripped off his swimming goggles to check the scoreboard. It said WR – World Record –&nbsp;he had won his fourth Gold medal!</p>



<p><em>To win, we must have a zeal to improve this version of ourselves and start with better routines to build amended habits that slowly bring us to success.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Develop steady habits by working on your cornerstone habit</h2>



<p>Habits are important. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/mindful-habits-for-your-mental-health-during-covid-19/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">But some habit patterns are much more important than others.</a> Cornerstone habits are the basic habits that you perform out of your natural flow. These can transform your life by subconsciously triggering other good complementary practices. </p>



<p>There are many studies (<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/assets/Sites/Longwood_Seminars/Exercise3.14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including this one by Harvard Medical School</a>) that say that people who exercise regularly, habitually also get to eat healthily and procrastinate lesser and use their credit cards less too. They ultimately, also witness many unexpected positive changes in their lives!</p>



<p><em>Look for a cornerstone habit that will help you look at yourself differently. Focus on it and stick to it every day. Over time, you will witness incredible results.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Small wins lead you to develop steady habits.</h2>



<p>You&#8217;re not going to magically wake up one day and find that you&#8217;ve mastered something. Good things take time. And steady habits are a great thing. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to acknowledge the process and enjoy it. Many people fail to even start with good habits because they try too much at once. The idea is to focus on baby steps and not take large ones. Small wins turn small advantages into healthy patterns. These small advantages provide hope that significant results are within reach.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“I try to get six pages a day.”</p><cite>Stephen King</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Whether you are an aspiring author aiming to publish your next bestseller, or an entrepreneur striving to be the next Bill Gates, we hope you reach the top of your field through improved mental and physical habits for the success you desire.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Develop more willpower, and lead yourself to your steady habits.</h2>



<p>Did you know that willpower can be learned? It&#8217;s like learning how to drive better or working on a muscle that gets strained and fatigued at the gym. So how do we develop willpower and make it work in our favor?</p>



<p>To work on your willpower, do the uncomfortable but necessary tasks first. If making a presentation is more daunting than replying to twenty emails, then do the former first. If saving money is tough for you, then start small and slowly build. </p>



<p>To develop willpower we need to focus on small wins and stick to the habit. The more willpower we use, the stronger it develops, and habit patterns naturally follow, allowing us to succeed the way we desire.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find a support group and your success through it.</h2>



<p>When things sail smoothly, willpower and cornerstone habits sail smoothly, but when we face the odds, many of us revert to the original old habits. When we get exhausted trying, we start to feel that we are kidding ourselves about improving personally.</p>



<p>A support group of people who are inclined to help you, motivate you and keep a check on you comes in useful. A support group teaches us how to believe in ourselves as we see the belief in their eyes. In turn, it helps us to stick to our effort when the chips are down. Check this guide by Roomi on how you can <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/fun-nyc-meetup-groups/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">meet new people in New York City</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reward yourself every time you cross a milestone.</h2>



<p>My friend, who wants to do her daily runs and exercises regularly, is also fond of cookies. So she makes a deal with herself and eats a cookie only after she completes her tasks for sixty minutes. Link a reward to a cornerstone habit that you want to develop; it&#8217;ll motivate you more to stick to it. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/home-environment-and-healthy-living-habits-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is key in working towards the success you wish for.</a></p>



<p>If we do the right thing most of the time, Marcus Aurelius wrote in “<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://amzn.to/2ncj41b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meditations</a>,” we will do well for ourselves.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Visualize yourself developing steady habits and reaching success.</h2>



<p><em>When you envision it in your mind, you will do much better.</em></p>



<p>Coach Bowman used to tell Michael Phelps to watch a particular videotape before he slept and when he woke up. It was a fake video of a perfect race. In this video, Phelps would jump off the block on the whistle, dive into the pool, watch himself swim till the end of the line, and Phelps concentrated on the details while watching it. How his arms were stroking the pool&#8217;s walls, how it felt to pull his swimming cap off at the end, and more.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Bowman would say “Put on the tape” to encourage Phelps to be the best he could.</p></blockquote>



<p>Phelps noticed that would then try to push himself harder. He knew what he was doing because he had seen it in his mind many times. With time, he got faster and faster and crushed the competition.</p>



<p>It is the same with learning to speak publicly or to lose weight. You “put on the tape, ” and visualize yourself going through the routine. Remember, champions do ordinary things extraordinarily well. You will live this life only once, and you should make the most of it. Achieve the success you want and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/top-10-habits-to-make-life-easier/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">use healthy habits to get there.</a></p>
