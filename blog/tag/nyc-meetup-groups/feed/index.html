<p>You&#8217;re finally settled in your New York apartment! But you&#8217;re also finding yourself spending one too many hours aimlessly scrolling through Instagram or starting yet another series on Netflix&#8230;</p>



<p>It’s easy to crawl into a comfortable hole away from the bustling city and spend time by yourself. But it’s not healthy physically or mentally in the long run. So, get off your bum! Continue a hobby you used to love a few years ago with hobby clubs in NY, or start learning something new entirely: tickle your happy hormones with NYC meetup groups.</p>



<p>Even if you’re an introvert and don’t want to meet new people, there are classes in New York you can take by yourself to stay active.</p>

<p>When your passion is science but you don’t have friends who share your interests, join New York’s <a href="http://secretscienceclub.blogspot.com/">Secret Science Club</a>. Find fellow nerds to discuss the nuances of the cosmos and the brain, crocodiles and ecologies, and chemical reactions. Listen to award-winning scientists give lectures and present information about their subjects while you sip on your drink.</p>



<p>You don’t have to be an expert – you just need to have an interest. Members swear they feel way more educated after joining the Club!</p>

<p>Playgrounds have rarely been the favorite place for the LGBT+ members. Unfairness due to discrimination and locker-room bullying have been widespread. If you belong to the LGBT community (or are an ally) and love sports, find your safe space at <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://bigapplerecsports.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Apple Recreational Sports</a> who say, “our leagues are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all participants.” Form bowling, dodgeball, and kickball teams and make new friends via this NYC meetup group.</p>

<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://creativemornings.com/cities/nyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CreativeMornings</a> organizes field trips and talks by, well, creative people in more than 200 cities across the world on Sunday mornings. Attend their events in NYC and you’ll discover the different ways people can be creative – how a musician makes music out of everyday objects, how an entrepreneur started selling coffee, and how two young men tell compelling stories about faraway people. Many participants are re-visitors and you’ll soon start seeing familiar friendly faces around.</p>

<p>We admit we couldn’t pick just any one book club because books and readers, and their moods and identities, are ever so diverse. So, visit the <a href="https://www.nypl.org/education/adults/book-discussion-groups" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">New York Public Library</a> where you can choose the club that best fits you; the library hosts book discussion groups frequently.</p>



<p>The themes of New York’s book clubs range from political buffs, womxn of color, Asian women, classic literature, comic books, etc. catering to various diasporas and niche communities. Find some more bookstores and their clubs on <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=book+clubs&amp;find_loc=New+York%2C+NY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Yelp</a>, too.</p>

<p>The real-time social network of our generation! When he arrived at The Upper West Side in ’97, Dave Cervini found it hard to make new friends in NYC and founded <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.newyorksocialnetwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYSN</a>. Since then, the growing network has been holding regular meetup groups in NYC by organizing activities. These include bowling, scavenger hunts in parks and museums, movies, bar trivia nights, history tours, and more. The gatherings are usually limited to small groups and are a great way to meet people.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City recently hit a new population high point.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">8.5 million peoples. Yup. And the Bronx is growing the fastest. Yet it can be surprisingly tough to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hobby-clubs-and-classes-in-new-york-where-you-can-meet-new-people-part-3/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">meet new people</a> if your schedule is already spoken for. Or maybe you just don’t dig that vibe when everybody knows everyone else. It can make you feel more like you’re trying to get your foot in the door in a company than trying to chill and have a good time.</span> Which is where NYC meetup groups can be really helpful. social meetups in NYC are very common and a fantastic way of meeting like-minded people. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/cities/us/ny/new_york/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meetup.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has tons of groups, and it’s less about forming impenetrable cool kid clicks and more about meeting new people, like, all the time. So here’s a few groups you can try covering a variety of interests, from personal to professional. And if you need a wingman, grab your roommate(s) and get them in on it too.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The best of NYC meetup groups: <b>Hudson Valley Hikers</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boasting their status as the most active group in the country, this</span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/hvhikers/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">meetup crew</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has nearly 30,000 members and is totally, beautifully free. No fees, just great hiking for active people. While based out of the Big Apple, they go all over New York State in search of challenging, fun hikes with gorgeous views to enjoy. They also have some other activities going on, like indoor rock climbing in case you’re really sick of hanging around on the ground all the time.</span> So, if you&#8217;re athletic, this is one of the best NYC meetup groups for you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The most dynamic of NYC meetup groups: <b>I Wanted To Do That Just Not Alone</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awesome name, right?</span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/justnotalone/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of nearly 20,000 friends is the very definition of honesty in advertising. The name says it all. They do a variety of events that people would so totally have done themselves if their friends weren’t busy, out of town, or have been absorbed by the couch and become a permanent lump in the upholstery. Urban athletics, not-so-urban athletics, and movies with a view are just a small sample of all the exciting stuff this group has to offer.</span> These social meetups in NYC are all about having a good time as a community, and who doesn&#8217;t want that?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Alternative To The Bar Fun Things To Do In NYC</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of social stuff in NYC tends to revolve around bars and clubs. But not even close to all of it. If drinking shots all night just isn’t your thing and you’re at a loss for how to meet cool people and hang out, this</span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/funthingstodoinnyctoday/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">meetup group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has got you covered. A free summer speaker’s session, billiards, comedy clubs, and more await if you want to try something a little different. With over 22,000 people looking to hang out, you’re bound to find something to chat with during whatever off-beat event you attend. It&#8217;s one of the most popular meetup groups in NYC.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a heads up, their might be drinks available wherever you happen to go</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> So, they aren’t anti-alcohol, they’re just looking to shake things up a bit.</span> This group proves that contrary to popular belief, social meetups in NYC aren&#8217;t all about getting drunk!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, grab a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-perks-of-co-living-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate</a>, pack a friend, or head out solo on a mission to meet new people this weekend. Don’t wait for people to introduce themselves to you. If there’s one thing NYC loves, it’s a strong initiative.</span></p>
