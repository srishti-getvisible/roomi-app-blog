<p>As we all know, a stoner regularly takes or is <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stoner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">habitually high on drugs</a>, for example, cannabis, marijuana. Living with a stoner roommate can be exhausting, but they live by etiquette that will guide you. Not every 420 friendly roommate abides by the same code of social behavior, but some guidelines can live with persistence.</p>



<p>There are pros and cons to living with a pothead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros of living with a pothead</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. They are creative thinkers.</strong></h3>



<p>While some stoner roommates sit around moping all day long, the majority run successful businesses. They say that weed relaxes an overactive mind and stimulates the brain to think outside the box. You can be rest assured that they won’t delay rent payments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Allows for deeper connection.</strong></h3>



<p>Living with a pothead allows for deeper connection, a special kind of bond. A stoner roommate tends to be more honest and vulnerable. They are very loyal, and this will open you to appreciate how endearing and incomprehensible they are. Your <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.420smokers.us/living-with-a-stoner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">420 friendly roommate</a> will have many hours of deep conversations with you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. They&#8217;re fun and chill.</strong></h3>



<p>Your 420 friendly roommate knows how to chill and have fun. You already know their favorite hobby is smoking, and they love to get cozily ensconced at home surrounded by food and friends. Sometimes they act differently, not in a scary way but probably more relaxed and high. Well, surprisingly, this can be a great thing since <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://elitedaily.com/wellness/how-much-weed-smoke-to-relieve-stress/1962753/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking pot relieves stress</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cons of living with a pothead</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>1. Losing connection with the outside world: </strong></h3>



<p>Living with a pothead who smokes too much weed will subconsciously let it diminish their opportunities to make the most out of life. They end <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/culture/from-a-stoner-to-a-stoner-why-smoking-too-much-weed-can-fck-up-your-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing their connection</a> with the outside world, not caring about what they see and what happens to them. It is a mental and physical numbness that triggers a loss of regard for the people, responsibilities, and potential for growth within your immediate and ever-evolving life.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>2. Accidentally eat a pot brownie</strong>.</h3>



<p><strong>I</strong>f your 420 friendly roommate is a jerk, they can sneak some, especially when they don’t respect your choices. The best thing is to avoid home-baked pastries or pastries you didn’t purchase or make yourself.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>3. They have a funky smell</strong>.</h3>



<p>Living with a pothead will leave your apartment smelling like burnt rope, and you have to get used to it. It’ll hang on your clean clothes and follow you everywhere. The bright side is some people like the tobacco smell.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>4. The fun doesn’t last</strong>.</h3>



<p>The <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.yourtango.com/201064123/9-pros-and-cons-dating-pothead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interesting stories</a> can get old after a while; if only weed makes them funny, your stoner roommate will stop being amusing and start to get on your nerves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Guidelines to note while living with a Pothead</strong></h2>



<p>Here are some guidelines to note when living with a pothead</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>When you want to host parties, your roommate would not want to be left out.</li><li>When you and your stoner roommate decide to host a party, communication is vital. As a non-smoker, you have friends who do not smoke and will like to be aware of your food choices. You need to communicate to guests, with the invitation and on arrival at your house.</li><li>You talk to them about the food and drinks you provide, whether they contain cannabis/marijuana, how much was incorporated, and the potential effects. Also, consider making food and drinks for non-stoner roommates and guests, so guests can easily make their choices. These are the things you put into consideration when <a href="https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/opinion/unique-complications-living-stoner/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living with a pothead</a>.</li><li>There are moments where living with a pothead will bother you as a non-smoker; this is what you should do: Honesty is the best way to go, but the way you deliver this message will let you know if the discussion will go well. You can ask if they have time to talk about some roommate topics on things that make them uncomfortable. State it simply without being offensive that you aren’t bothered about the smoking, but the frequency that they do it is getting to you. You can suggest that the windows are left open, or they do it outside sometimes. Whatever will make you feel more comfortable and know that there will be counter suggestions, but you have to find a balance that’ll satisfy you both as it is both of your apartment and you both need to be comfortable.</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Is your coliving buddy giving you the heebie-jeebies and making you question your decision to move in with them? Well, if it is any consolation, there are all sorts of people in the world. Chances are that your coliving pairing needs some rhythm adjustment or perhaps a do-over. You started out strong, but things seem to be really off lately, and it&#8217;s making you wonder. TBH, your situation with your coliving buddy could either be temporary or permanent. Begin by asking yourself these questions:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>How is my bond with my roommate? Is it a toxic relationship/love-hate relationship?</li><li>Is there something that changed that&#8217;s making my otherwise cool roommate creepy?</li></ol>



<p>It&#8217;s only when you know what the problem is, you can find an appropriate solution. So let&#8217;s look at some common coliving situations that are turning your coliving buddy into a creep.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Creepy Coliving Situation #1 The Drunken One Night Stand</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/YPD6Z5WYJE0NpV6HyM/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="Creepy Coliving Situation"/></figure></div>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Awkward *</li></ul>



<p>Pandemic frustration or your loss of motor skills after a few shots, the aftermath can be quite uncomfortable. Coliving encounters such as these either blossom into love affairs or turn into a toxic relationship. So if your roommate won&#8217;t give up pursuing you and making you uneasy, here&#8217;s what you need to do.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi suggests:</strong>&nbsp;Stop pushing the problem under the rug and confront it. If suggesting this talk is uncomfy in person, try texts/DMs/emails &#8211; whatever sails your boat. Make sure to hear their side of the story and mutually find ways to make this less awkward. Make sure to treat carefully if there are any romantic feelings attached. If the unrequited love is too unbearable for either one of you, we suggest finding a new roommate or coliving setup. Do this to prevent heartbreaks &amp; limit proximity.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/help-i-am-in-love-with-my-roommate-roomi/">Help! I Am In Love With My Roommate!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Creepy Coliving Situation #2 The Goth Who Loves Witchcraft</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/of6lgDjRt4z0A/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="Creepy Coliving Situation"/></figure></div>



<p>Ahh, this one! When you first met them their quick wit, charm, and unique dressing made you inquisitive. Your new coliving bud was so cool that their personality totally bewitched you. However, now you can&#8217;t help but notice them giving you the occasional cold stare at 3 AM while mumbling incoherently. * big gulp *</p>



<p><strong>Roomi suggests:</strong>&nbsp;Everyone has different beliefs &amp; religions they follow. As long as their beliefs are not hurting you or making you uncomfortable, it&#8217;s manageable. However, in a coliving, if your beliefs don&#8217;t match then the chances of your pairing turning into a toxic relationship is quite high. So you have the option of finding a roommate who shares your beliefs or staying with someone who makes you uneasy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Creepy Coliving Situation #3 The Pervy Roommate</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/7hKSQxKxjputW/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="Creepy Coliving Situation"/></figure></div>



<p>This type is quite the shameless one in our mix. They eye you like a piece of pâtisserie and you always find them tracking you in the room. They have zero sense of personal space and they love to pass inappropriate comments about how gorgeous your legs are. You have warned them a number of times but now this coliving setting is too much for your to handle.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi Suggests:</strong>&nbsp;A roommate should never make you feel queasy and unsafe in your own home. Toxic relationships aside, a pervy roommate will always have you watching your back. It can be repulsive, irritating and frightening too. It sucks but you have to bid them a farewell ASAP. Make sure to tell a close one about your situation and gather enough evidence to evict them.</p>

<p>Who says compatibility issues arise only in a romantic arrangement? Your disrespectful roommate is capable of turning your smile into a frown in 0.05 seconds. And, here you are holding your head, trying to figure out if you&#8217;re overthinking or if you&#8217;re really living with a toxic roommate. All the signs of an inconsiderate roommate are there, yet you question yourself. You just don&#8217;t know how to deal with a toxic roommate. Here&#8217;s how the urban dictionary describes a toxic person:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;An adjective used to describe usually a very negative person, that bitch about everything, spread unnecessary hate or just talk shit about others.</em>&#8221;  </p><cite>Toxic, Urban Dictionary*</cite></blockquote>



<p>Does that sound like your roomi? If you&#8217;re still wondering, maybe the following toxic personality traits might help you identify what you&#8217;re dealing with.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. A toxic roommate never pays their rent on time</h2>



<p>This is the one of the most common signs of an inconsiderate roommate. They know that you have a fixed day every month to pay the rent. However, your disrespectful roommate always fail to do so, and they tend to supplement this with truckloads of never-ending excuses. There have been many occasions where they&#8217;ve asked you to pay for them, promising that they return the money ASAP. Sure, your money comes back, but in unimaginable short installments. Living with a toxic roommate can take a serious hit on your bank account.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Your toxic roommate is unapologetic</h2>



<p>Your disrespectful roommate uses your stuff without your permission &#8211; she would wear your clothes and leave them in your pile of laundry. When you ask them or confront them, they would either shrug, play the blame card or turn it around and make you look like you&#8217;re overreacting.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. They bring out the worst in you</h2>



<p>Your friends describe you as a bright, talented chirpy person, but guess what? At home, you&#8217;re an entirely different bean, and it may be because of your roommate. To clarify, it&#8217;s your disrespectful roommate&#8217;s lack of cooperation in basic daily tasks&nbsp;<em>(like washing the dishes &amp; keeping the house clean)</em>&nbsp;that&#8217;s you turning into hulk lately. Because living with a toxic roommate really makes you feel like a grumpy old man. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. A Toxic roommate will ignore you</h2>



<p>They avoid you like the plague and dodge any scope of conversation with you. If you come home with a friend, they will ignore them too. It&#8217;s funny how you&#8217;re the one living with a toxic roommate, but they&#8217;re the one avoiding you. </p>



<p>If you walk into a room where they are stationed, your disrespectful roommate will just get up and walk into another. These extreme reactions might make you feel like you&#8217;re at fault <em>(if it bothers you &#8211; try talking to them)</em>. If they hate confrontations- send them a text, but make sure to clear the air. But, if your roomi does this repeatedly, even after a discussion, then this, my friend, is a behavioral pattern &#8211; and it looks like you&#8217;re on the uncomfortable receiving end.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. They make you feel bad about yourself</h2>



<p>This is a classic trait of a toxic roommate because a toxic roommate will always pick on your insecurities and telling you how you need to work harder on yourself. But this doesn&#8217;t just end with your grades/academic life; they tend to quote instances from your personal life and comment on the way you look. Since no one ever teaches you how to deal with a toxic roommate, this can really affect your self-esteem. Friendships are made of friendly banter and a ton of leg-pulling, but your roomi takes it to another level, and you can tell that they are trying to pull you down. So listen to your instincts and ask them to back off.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. They are trying to get fresh with your SO</h2>



<p>Your toxic roommate knows that your boyfriend is coming over to chill with you, so she gets dressed to get their attention. Moreover, she will just throw herself between the two of you at any given opportunity. So forget privacy, there will be days she will be sliding into his DMs and calling him to chill with her. This is a big no-no and if your roomi is playing tricks like this on you, it&#8217;s time you lose her.</p>
