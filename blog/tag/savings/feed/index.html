<p>Your 20s really are a magical time in your life. You’re right in the middle of figuring out who you are, what you want out of life, and not to mention, making awesome memories! But when you’re in your 20s, you’re also bad at handling money. It just seems to disappear from your account as soon as it gets there! This is why you need some tips on how to save money so that you can set yourself up for a bright future.</p>



<p>If you think you’re too young to be worried about money and savings in your 20s, think again. Your 20s are a time when you&#8217;re the most financially vulnerable in your professional life. This is why having savings becomes even more important. But don’t freak out. We’ve got your back. Because this is so important, we’ve compiled a list of very helpful tips on how to save money. Take a look now and your future self will thank you later!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips on how to save money: How much should I actually be saving?</strong></h2>



<p>Experts say that as in your 20s, your savings should be around 25% of your monthly income, before taxes and other deductions. Now I know 25% seems like a lot of money to save, but it includes any retirement plans you may have (we’ll talk about this in detail later). So, saving 25% every month actually isn’t all that bad once you break down the costs. And of course, if you follow our tips on how to save money, it will be a whole lot easier.</p>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.moneyunder30.com/percentage-of-income-should-you-save-every-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here is a really helpful guide</a> to help you figure out how to break down your costs on a monthly basis!</p>

</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“What are my goals?”</strong></h2>



<p>I know you spend approximately 90% of your 20s asking yourself this very question (The other 10 percent is spent asking what you want to eat for dinner). But your savings largely depend on what you want out of life. Maybe you want to travel the world one day or have a destination wedding. If you want to buy a three BHK by the time you’re 30, you better start saving a lot more money. These tips on how to save money will only help you if you know what goals you’re working towards. So, before anything else, find out what you want your future to look like.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Become a habitual saver!</strong></h2>



<p>I know saving money is really hard for a lot of people. I mean, there are distractions everywhere. I mean, even Instagram has a shopping option now, for god’s sake! But for the sake of your future self, you need to get your spending under control. Your Savings build up over time, but they can also deplete over time if you don’t keep a check on it. These would not be good tips on how to save money if we didn’t show you a couple of tricks to cut down your spendings. You can start with shopping at more affordable grocery stores and buying canned goods whenever you can. Try shopping at thrift stores where you get a wide variety of clothes at a fraction of their original cost.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the case of an emergency!</strong></h2>



<p>This is one of the most important points in this list of tips on how to save money. Having some money for emergencies is really important. You cannot predict the future, but you can certainly prepare for it. Not having an emergency fund can have terrible consequences. In the case of an emergency, you might find all your savings gone. So, set aside some money each month in your emergency fund. It doesn’t have to be a lot, just 1% or 2%. If you do just this for even eight months, you’ll have a good size fund for your 20s.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Roomi tip-</strong> Make sure this fund is completely liquid. That means you should be able to access it whenever you want.  Your savings account is a good place to keep it.</p></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get your retirement fund started!</h2>



<p>Yes, I know, you hardly ever want to think about your retirement in your 20s. After all, it’s <em>at least</em> a few decades away. But if you want to have enough money to survive when you’re old, you need to get your savings in order <em>now</em>. There’s a lot of great retirement plans that you can look into, including employer-sponsored ones. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/retirement/typesofplans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here is a really helpful list</a> that can help you decide which one suits you best. and also, don&#8217;t be like Homer Simpson!</p>

<p>The way you handle finances in your youth is likely to remain the same throughout your 20&#8217;s &#8211; unless you do something about it. If you are impulsive around money when you&#8217;re young, you will likely struggle with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial issues</a> in your 30&#8217;s. Financial planning and lessons learned late in life can be costly. If you learn how to protect your savings in your 30&#8217;s (which includes getting a retirement fund FYI), you&#8217;ll make the rest of your life a hundred times easier.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s never too late to consider making sound financial decisions that you may have missed along the way. It&#8217;s essential to learn the basics of finances, whether you earn money or not. Budgeting, financial planning, and savings are useful learnings for all ages.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Financial Planning 101: Start saving</h2>



<p>You can then make your finances work for you. Find out your monthly expenditure and stick to your budget for at least three months. This way, you can build a habit and push yourself to hold on to that attitude for the year. As you consistently depend on your budget to handle your finances, you get to manage money much better. It will then help you gain clarity on your non-essential expenditure.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Start your financial planning early</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re young, it&#8217;s easy to push financial planning and financial goals to the later stages of your life (and to the back of your mind). People think that saving starts once you are secure and have a job or have many responsibilities. Nothing can be far from that as financial planning and goals begin early in your life.</p>



<p>Put that little money you have in your possession to good use. Know what you want to have, and take this time to practice essential money management habits. All habits reared at this stage of life, i.e., savings, budgeting, and living well within your means, go a long way toward shaping your life and attitude.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Beware of debt when financial planning</h2>



<p>You will require debt at some stage in life but try to have &#8216;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/12/good-debt-bad-debt.asp" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">good debt</a>.&#8217; Avoid lifestyle debts to match your friends or colleagues. Go for a small, simple car as your first car rather than a flashy one. Just because your friend wears the latest branded clothes does not mean that you should do the same. Do not let your life get derailed by other people&#8217;s lifestyles. This way, you will have room to pay for a deposit towards your house.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Protect your savings</h2>



<p>Protect your savings and link them to your long-term goals. If you have saved for emergencies, don&#8217;t touch that money unless you are in a crisis. If you&#8217;re serious about financial planning, it&#8217;s really important to have an emergency fund. It&#8217;s best to maintain a six-month emergency fund. with three months&#8217; worth in a liquid fund. It is time to be mature and remain disciplined to your savings goals &#8211; and not deviate from them just because you feel like splashing out on a new flashy watch.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Be aware of your credit</h2>



<p>Be cautious of your credit card spending, and do not cross one-third of your credit limit. Keep no more than three credit cards, and make sure that you pay off the bill at the end of the month. This way, you avoid unnecessary interest on a part paid credit.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Manage your income</h2>



<p>You might have made all the right financial plans and decisions, but you need to review them regularly. A review helps your finances align with external factors like interest rate cuts that might affect your savings. A map of your financial situation is periodically required when you move to a steady income stage and thereby reallocate the spread.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Too early for retirement fund?</h2>



<p>Your financial planning will not be complete without a retirement fund.  It&#8217;s like going to the gym regularly – some can, many can&#8217;t. When you begin to build this habit early in your life, you get stuck to it as a &#8216;normal,&#8217; just like savings. Retirement fund works the best when you are regular with it and under 30. We strongly recommend contributing towards your retirement fund. For more info on the different types of retirement funds, <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/retirement/typesofplans" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">check this out</a>!</p>

<p>It pays to make the right financial decisions in life. Build that savings base, manage your debt, and have controlled spending patterns. A financially literate person will make better business decisions and will use the finances productively to serve their best needs.</p>
