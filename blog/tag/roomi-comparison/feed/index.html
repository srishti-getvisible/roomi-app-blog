										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Stepping out of your comfort zone and traveling to a new city is super rewarding. We get to experience new cultures and beautiful locations, and meet new people along the way. Some people believe you can’t truly experience a city unless you’ve lived there a while, so they head online to find their next temp home! Airbnb is one of the most popular booking sites for finding accommodation in cities all over the world. That said, it’s definitely not the only website you can use. With its surge in popularity, Airbnb listings often sell out fast! And, with such high demand, the prices have also shot up. So if you’re searching for an Airbnb alternative, we’ve got a list to start you off. Read on to discover websites like Airbnb that can make your travel hassle-free.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="top-sites-like-airbnb">Top Sites Like Airbnb</h2>



<p>Looking for an apartment to rent with some cool people? Or just looking for somewhere short-term to stay while you stopover before your next city? This list of sites like Airbnb has something for everyone &#8211; dive in!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-roomi">1. Roomi</h2>

<p>Roomi is one of the best room finders out there for many reasons. Let’s explore them below!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-listings">No-fee listings</h3>



<p>No-fee listings mean that, whether you book a room or a whole place, you’ll be paying no extra charges on top of the rent. It’s a cheaper alternative to Airbnb because what you see is what you pay.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Tdl1FLjq1lORPjN6In" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/Tdl1FLjq1lORPjN6In/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If you’re traveling or moving with your pet, Roomi’s got you covered with its pet-friendly filters. Whether you have a dog, cat, or something entirely different, you can find listings that welcome your little friend with open arms.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Roomi offers a subletting service to take the complications out of subletting. That means you can rent out your place to other tenants, to save some money and do some more traveling! With secure in-app messaging and a robust verification process, you can sublet your apartment anywhere in the world that allows it!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="amenities">Amenities</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="753" height="167" data-attachment-id="19628" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/airbnb-alternative/attachment/amenities-on-roomi/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?fit=753%2C167&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="753,167" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="amenities-on-Roomi" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?fit=300%2C67&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?fit=753%2C167&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?resize=753%2C167&#038;ssl=1" alt="amenities-on-Roomi" class="wp-image-19628" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?w=753&amp;ssl=1 753w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?resize=300%2C67&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></figure></div>



<p>Whether you’re leasing a place for a short period or a longer duration, comfort is key. If it’s a doorman you need, a gym to unwind in, or an in-house washer to do laundry, you can choose from over 30 amenities on Roomi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="listing-type-and-house-rules">Listing Type and House Rules</h3>



<p>If all of this sounds too good to be true, it’s not! There are even more benefits of using Roomi as an Airbnb alternative. For example, you can filter by entire place, own room, or even a shared room. So both groups and solo travelers have enough options to choose from.</p>



<p>Once you’ve filtered by listing, you can also select house rules like whether smoking is allowed or guests can come over.</p>



<p>To sum it up, if you want a one-stop solution for all of your accommodation needs, Roomi is the way to go. They offer both a mobile app and website so all you have to do is visit this <a href="https://roomiapp.com/rooms" class="broken_link">link</a> and take it from there.</p>

<p>Another Airbnb alternative, VRBO is an abbreviation for Vacation Rental By Owner. As the name indicates, it’s great for renting places if you’re on vacation. It’s got over a million properties worldwide in the most popular travel destinations. However, if you’re looking to relocate, you might find this an expensive long-term rental. You also have to pay a booking fee when you select your rental.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Another website like Airbnb, Booking.com lets you filter through rooms and apartments. With an easy-to-use interface, this site can help you find a rental anywhere in the world. And what’s more? It’s usually a much cheaper alternative to Airbnb. However, you’re unlikely to be able to split the cost of renting with a roommate unless you’re traveling with them.</p>

<p></p>



<p>This Airbnb alternative offers something completely different. Instead of a key to your rental, you get a passcode to your door &#8211; completely eliminating the need for a middleman. It caters exclusively to vacationers and holiday goers. Unfortunately, it currently only caters to the United States so it’s not the best fit if you’re planning on going international.</p>

<p>This Airbnb alternative offers a fun way to travel. As the name suggests, you can swap houses with someone in another part of the world for your vacation. However, you will need to pay to sign up. And more importantly, while this could be great for a short period of time, you can’t relocate permanently using this website. If you’re a little iffy with the idea of letting someone else take over your property, you can choose to host people instead of swapping homes. This lets you earn ‘balloons’ that you can later use to travel.</p>

<p>Another popular service that’s similar to Airbnb, TripAdvisor Rentals offers vacation homes with the amenities you can find at home. One of the biggest advantages of using this site is that you get access to reviews of past renters. This will help you get an idea of exactly what you can expect from your rental. However, while it’s similar to Airbnb in terms of vacation homes, it doesn’t offer any long-term rentals such as apartments.</p>

<p>Moving to a new city? Your mind is probably brimming with questions right now &#8211; such as where and with whom will you live? The journey to your dream apartment is a pretty long one. You’re trying to find the best room finder, navigate interviews and make sure you can actually afford the place you want! So let’s get started, shall we? In this guide, you can compare HousingAnywhere with the HousingAnywhere alternative, Roomi, to learn more about these handy websites.</p>



<p>Now, take a breath of relief as we dive into finding the best room finder portal for you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-have-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What Filters &amp; Preferences Do These Room Finders Have to Help you Find your Perfect Room?</h2>



<p>A good room finder should offer you various search options that you can filter for speed and convenience. Typically, you should be able to filter by location, amenities, apartment types, price range, and more. This will help you simply jump on and input your preferences, making room finding fast, easy and stress-free.</p>



<p>Let’s compare the filters on offer with Roomi and HousingAnywhere.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No fee apartments</h3>



<p>When moving to a new apartment, you want to reduce your costs as much as possible. However, most apartments have some fees in the form of brokerage. On HousingAnywhere, you have to pay 25% of the first month’s rent as a one-time fee. But the HousingAnywhere alternative, Roomi, has no-fee apartments available to explore. This means that all listings are free &#8211; all you pay is the rent!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>



<p>You can&#8217;t leave your furry or feathery best friends behind, which is why there&#8217;s a pet-friendly filter on Roomi. There are distinct pet categories, where you can choose apartments suitable for dogs, cats or other pets. HousingAnywhere also provides the option to search pet-friendly apartments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Subletting is the process of renting an apartment or room inside a rental to another person for a set period of time. This is often tricky because the subtenant signs an agreement with you rather than with the landlord. Roomi has simplified the process for you.</p>



<p>On the Roomi app, you know who you&#8217;re living with by asking potential roommates to complete a background check before they apply to your listing. Furthermore, everything is documented and verified. You can also keep your contact info private by chatting to potential roommates through the Roomi app or website. HousingAnywhere, and other websites like HousingAnywhere also allow subletting services. However, the process is not always as transparent as it is on Roomi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>HousingAnywhere provides 5 amenities to filter your search by &#8211; a washing machine, air-con, dishwasher, dyer, and heating. But, you know what’s more convenient? A room finder that goes one step further and offers updated, important features, such as being able to find a non-binary roommate to live with. In fact, the HousingAnywhere alternative, Roomi includes all the filters HousingAnwhere has &#8211; and then some!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type (Entire Place/Shared Rooms)</h3>



<p>Both HousingAnywhere and the HousingAnywhere alternative, Roomi, allow you to filter on the basis of listing type. Again, the number of options varies between the apps.</p>



<p>For example, HousingAnywhere allows you to choose among a private room, shared room, studio, and apartment. Roomi not only checks if you want an entire place, your own room, or a shared room, but also allows you to choose how many rooms you’d prefer the listing to have.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>



<p>Everyone has their preferences, and most people want to live with roommates that have similar values and lifestyles as they do. With this in mind, Roomi allows you to filter choices for potential roommates. You can filter roommate searches based on age, gender, and house rules — the pet-friendly filter comes in useful here, too. HousingAnywhere also provides a few options to filter based on house rules, but not quite as many as Roomi.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which App Offers the Best Free and Paid Features?</h2>



<p>No one wants to fork out high fees for a room finder that doesn&#8217;t offer the best features. Roomi knows what matters to its users, and provides awesome features on both the free and paid plans.</p>

	</div>
	


<p>The Roomi pricing structure in a nutshell:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Free Members on Roomi:</strong> Free to sign up and list a place to rent.</li><li><strong>Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription:</strong> The Gold Subscription is available at $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week.</li></ol>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive deeper to see some features that make Roomi stand out from other room finders such as HousingAnywhere.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>On Roomi, it’s free to post an advertisement for a place to rent. Users can post up to two listings for free in any of the locations that Roomi supports. Likewise, it&#8217;s free to search for a place to rent. However, if users want to move more quickly, paying for Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription plan is recommended. Here’s what you get with the Gold subscription plan:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings</li><li>5 active listings to post all the empty rooms in your apartment</li></ul>



<p>HousingAnywhere, on the other hand, charges a 25% commission fee on the first month’s rent for both parties &#8211; whether they’re moving into a new place or renting out a room.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-App Messaging</h3>



<p>Roomi, the HousingAnywhere alternative, offers secure in-app messaging to its users, keeping information shared between potential roomies private. Users can also request that Roomi deletes personal information after they&#8217;ve found a roommate match. They can do so under the General Data Protection Regulation by contacting Roomi customer support or by filling out a form. With Roomi, you can also message any lister for free &#8211; a feature that&#8217;s not available on HousingAnywhere.</p>

<p>&lt;/aside&gt;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-listings-are-credible">Security: How Do These Apps Ensure That Listings Are Credible?</h2>



<p>If you want to live with another person in a new city, your safety is your topmost priority.</p>

<p>Roomi&#8217;s reputation as the best room finder is in part thanks to its commitment to the privacy and security of its users. Roomi protects you in the following ways:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The process of verifying your Listers account is a reliable way to ensure that the person living in the apartment you’re about to rent from is genuine. The verification process involves providing a copy of your lease, utility bill, or government-issued ID.</li><li>Your Roomi listing address is not visible to others on the app. Instead, only an approximate location is shown.</li><li>Roomi&#8217;s in-house content moderation team will review any listing or profile that violates Roomi policy.</li><li>If you’re uncomfortable or concerned about something you see, you can easily report it to Roomi’s 24/7 moderation team.</li></ol>



<p>HousingAnywhere, on the other hand, does not offer such rigorous security measures. HousingAnywhere reviews on several portals even mention it as illegitimate and unscrupulous. Users have also written about HousingAnywhere scams on these portals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, which is the Best Room Finder for you?</h2>



<p>A good room finder can make all the difference to your experience. There are a good number of roommate finder apps out there, but in our comparison of HousingAnywhere and the HousingAnywhere alternative, Roomi, there’s no doubt that Roomi comes out on top.</p>



<p>With its no-fee listing to advanced features and filters, Roomi simplifies the process of finding a place you can call home!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that moving to a new place is a life-changing experience that is exciting and terrifying in equal measures. There are many factors to consider, including rent, cost of living, city livability, neighborhood type, and more. These concerns might be stressful enough on their own, but when you add in the prospect of finding a suitable roommate? It can be overwhelming! Luckily, using roommate finder websites like Kopa, or the Kopa alternative, Roomi&nbsp;makes finding suitable roommates a breeze!</p>



<p><strong>Don&#8217;t sweat about finding the best roommate finder; we&#8217;ve already done that for you! Let&#8217;s get started.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are these roommate finder apps free or paid?</h2>



<p>There are a variety of options for finding housemates. But how can you know which is the best roommate finder? There are several ways to separate the best from the rest, with pricing being one of them!</p>



<p>When compared to other roommate finder websites like Kopa, its alternative Roomi clearly comes out on top. Why? Because there are no monthly subscription fees, no messaging fees, and it&#8217;s free to sign up and post a room on Roomi. It&#8217;s also completely free to look for a rental. Of course, if you want to get the most out of Roomi, there are paid premium services on offer.</p>



<p>Background checks, identity verification, messaging plans, listing credits, profile boosts, and listing boosts are all included in the Gold Plan bundle. Great, right? It costs $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week to subscribe. You&#8217;ll enjoy benefits like more visibility, robust security and could find a room faster!</p>

<p>On Kopa, hosts market their properties, and renters apply to and book those listings, find housemates, and pay deposits and monthly rent. There are no Kopa service fees for renters. Although, keep in mind, while using a credit card, renters pay a 2.9% + 30 cents credit card processing fee. If the payment is from an international account, there is an additional 1% transaction fee.</p>



<p>Users can send security deposits and leases via the platform. Renters need to pay&nbsp;a security deposit when they reserve a&nbsp;room, and that money is sent to the lister directly. Hosts can also&nbsp;refund security deposits to their renters directly through Kopa.&nbsp;They&nbsp;have the option to refund security deposits, add interest where appropriate, and upload copies of receipts for renters to examine when they move out.</p>



<p>They don&#8217;t offer background checks or credit checks at this time. If those things are important to you, it&#8217;s something you&#8217;ll have to arrange separately with the renter, which can be a long-winded process. A few Kopa reviews on <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/kopa.co?stars=1">Trustpilot</a> suggest that renters are facing issues with refunds due to improper management. For this reason &#8211; and some others that we&#8217;ll cover in the next section &#8211; Roomi makes the best Kopa alternative.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust">Security: Can these apps help me find roommates I can trust?</h2>



<p>In general, life in a new city is expensive. You want to save money in as many ways as possible, and finding safe roomies is one way to do so. Aside from that, you&#8217;ll want to be sure you&#8217;re getting the most bang for your buck.</p>



<p>Finding roommates on websites like Kopa&nbsp;and Roomi are fantastic, but it&#8217;s natural to have concerns such as &#8220;are these platforms&nbsp;legit?&#8221;.&nbsp;&#8220;How effectively is my profile protected?&#8221; or &#8220;How can I find safe roomies&#8221;?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="verification-of-roommate-contact-info">Verification of roommate contact info</h3>



<p>The majority of the renters on Kopa are approved by their employers, who are also Kopa&#8217;s business partners. Before messaging you, renters fill out a rental application. The only downside in terms of security is that, if you want to do a background check, you need to request one.</p>



<p>The Kopa alternative, Roomi, also considers the security of its users a priority. As such, it ensures the contact information of every user is obtained and verified, excelling in this area. Without invading your privacy, Roomi verifies your contact information (email and phone number). They use the trusted GlobaliD service for this.</p>



<p>Roomi&#8217;s goal is to make finding roommates as safe and secure as possible. Every user has the choice to authenticate their identity and do a background check so that others know they&#8217;re speaking with a genuine, reliable person.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="id-verifications-for-potential-roommates">ID Verifications for potential roommates</h3>



<p>The alternative of Kopa, Roomi conducts verification of your government-issued ID and keeps that information safe using GlobaliD. This means that Roomi allows you to&nbsp;select information to keep or remove, depending on specific circumstances. You will obtain the confirmed badge once your ID has been validated, which will strengthen your listing and increase your chances to find suitable roommates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="privacy-security-of-profiles">Privacy &amp; security of profiles</h3>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Similarly, Roomi goes above and beyond to protect your data using GlobaliD. It also gives you control over your data, allowing you to delete or change it in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Once you&#8217;ve found someone who fits your criteria, you may contact them using the app&#8217;s safe in-app chat feature. You won&#8217;t have to disclose any additional personal information with a potential roommate as a result of this.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="24-7-support-content-moderation">24/7 support &amp; content moderation</h3>



<p>The main source of assistance at Roomi is a comprehensive FAQ section that addresses practically every topic that may come up. An in-house content moderation team is also available to provide further help and content moderation so you can find rooms or roommates stress-free!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="criminal-background-checks">Criminal background checks</h3>



<p>Kopa does not conduct any criminal background checks unless you make a request. Unlike Kopa, Roomi is thorough, and conducts prior criminal background checks against known international and relevant local intelligence.</p>



<p>Roomi is not only simple to use with a clean user interface, but it also streamlines your roommate search while protecting your privacy and considering your interests. With these features, you&#8217;ll find safe roomies in no time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-profiles-which-app-makes-it-easier-to-find-your-perfect-roommate">User Profiles: Which App Makes It Easier to Find Your Perfect Roommate?</h2>



<p>When looking for a place to rent or for your next roommates, don&#8217;t put up with the hassle or scams that can come with Craigslist and Facebook. You can&nbsp;use Roomi to find roommates with a process that&#8217;s as simple and stress-free as they come. Both roommate finder apps are excellent, but when comparing their capabilities, the alternative of&nbsp;Kopa, Roomi, comes out on top.</p>



<p>Because it can be difficult to find roommates the way you want, Roomi has made it possible to filter roommates by neighborhoods, gender, budget, and other variables.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Additionally, with Roomi&#8217;s Perfect Roommate Matching Algorithm, you can be confident that you&#8217;ll discover the perfect roommate for you. Roomi offers a filter for age, an LGBTQ+ friendly filter, and even a filter for home rules.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-roommate-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Roommate Finder For You?</h2>



<p>There are a lot of roommate finders out there, but only a handful of them provide the qualities you&#8217;ll need to find good roommates. Fortunately, Roomi&nbsp;has everything! Unlike websites like Kopa, where there is no formal verification, the Kopa alternative Roomi protects your personal information, has verified users, and carries out thorough&nbsp;background checks.</p>



<p>Start your journey with Roomi today and find&nbsp;a roommate in no time!</p>

<p>Moving to a new city can be both an exhilarating and challenging experience. While you&#8217;re excited to work in a different environment and meet new people, finding the perfect apartment can be daunting. Apart from the location, you also have to worry about having a rental cost that fits your budget and needs. Roomi and Apartment List are apps that can help you find rooms for rent on top of other services and features.</p>



<p>You may be asking yourself, &#8220;Is Apartment List legit?&#8221; How does Roomi verify users? How do you know if the listings are credible? If you&#8217;re planning on finding out the answers to these, we&#8217;ve saved you the time by comparing them for you. Here&#8217;s our Roomi and Apartment List review to get you started.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room"><strong>Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?</strong></h2>

<p>No one wants to go through dozens of room finders and reviews just to find the perfect room for rent. Each room finder may have unique features and services, but how many really give you value for your money? Only a comprehensive Roomi and Apartment List review will give you the answers you need. Let&#8217;s put the two apps head-to-head to see which app has the best tools for a seamless experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No fee apartments</h3>



<p>Is Apartment List legit? To list a property on Apartment List, there are pricing options that cater to your requirements. These aren&#8217;t publicly listed, so you&#8217;ll need to email Apartment List to get a customized package. With Apartment List alternative Roomi, you don&#8217;t need to pay any fees to sign up and list a property. It&#8217;s absolutely free. Under a free account, you can also send up to five messages or swipes per day and activate up to two listings. It is therefore much easier to list a property on Roomi.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>



<p>Websites like Apartment List don&#8217;t really let you specify if having pets around is okay or a no-go, which is a bit of a bummer if you&#8217;re planning on moving with a furry friend. Meanwhile, Roomi lets you tick a filter so you can find pet-friendly apartments &#8211; great news for you and your puppy!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s an Apartment List review on subletting. Okay, so this isn&#8217;t an issue with Apartment List. If you&#8217;re a tenant wanting to sublet a room or an entire apartment, you&#8217;ll need to discuss this directly with the landlord or homeowner. The same goes for Apartment List alternative Roomi, and it&#8217;s even explicitly stated on its homepage. The great thing about Roomi is that it also helps you safely find roommates, or, in this case, sublessees.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>When using websites like Apartment List, you can choose which amenities matter most to you. Options include accessibility, air conditioning, grilling equipment, down to ice makers, dishwashers, in-unit laundry, parking, and swimming pools, among other. With Roomi, on the other hand, you can choose all of the above plus also specify if you want an elevator, TV, and Wi-Fi. These are features not listed under Apartment List&#8217;s filter for amenities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type (entire place/shared rooms)</h3>



<p>For this Apartment List review, we&#8217;ve found that you can indicate an entire place or just a bed or two. But the app doesn&#8217;t allow you to specify if you want to share a room, which is important if you&#8217;re cash-strapped. Under a Roomi account, you can choose from the entire place, a private room, or a shared room.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>



<p>As far as the house rules filter goes for websites like Apartment List, there&#8217;s not much to say. That&#8217;s because you won&#8217;t find any. With Roomi, meanwhile, you can really find your ideal place. With this Apartment List alternative, you can specify if you prefer non-smokers and whether you mind having couples or pets around.</p>

<p>No Apartment List or Roomi review would be complete without a comparison of their free and paid features. After all, you don&#8217;t want to end up paying for a room finder that doesn&#8217;t really give you helpful features and services. Although Apartment List lets you list properties for free, you pay a back-end fee when someone books through the app.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s great to know that Roomi has amazing features that you can benefit from without needing to pay a single cent. Here are just some amazing ones that you can enjoy as a free user.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing free listings</h3>



<p>With Roomi, you can list up to two properties for free. You can also use these to activate any pending or deactivated listings. When signing up for a Roomi Gold subscription, you get an even bigger bang for your buck. First, you need to choose between a personal or a business plan. Personal users get unlimited messaging, identity verification, and a ranking boost for seven times more views on listings. Depending on the business tier you choose, you can get a verified partner badge, unlimited listings, and unlimited messaging. Pay either $29.99 for one month or $14.99 per week.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-app messaging</h3>



<p>We&#8217;re all aware of the presence of hackers and false profiles online. You&#8217;ll be happy to know that Apartment List alternative Roomi guarantees secure in-app messaging so you can keep your communication private. You can also easily message a property owner on Apartment List, but the app doesn&#8217;t really offer a specialized privacy or security feature for its users.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that Roomi gives you greater value for your money with both of its free and paid features.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?</h2>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>On Apartment List, when signing up, you&#8217;ll need to provide your name, contact info, budget, income, renter history, and apartment preferences. While there are listings labeled as &#8220;verified,&#8221; Apartment List does not mention any investment in tech to automate user verification.</p>



<p>As an Apartment List alternative, Roomi verifies a user&#8217;s phone number and email address with GlobaliD, a digital identity platform. Users need to create a GlobaliD and connect it with Roomi. Through this system, GlobaliD verifications describe something about users that a third-party agency has verified to be true. This feature goes to show that Roomi puts a premium on keeping users&#8217; information secure and verifying users&#8217; authenticity. That&#8217;s fewer points for this part of the Apartment List review.</p>



<p>Your private data is safely stored in the GlobaliD vault, which cannot be accessed or shared without your explicit consent. This means that your data isn’t stored on each new service provider you choose to connect to your GlobaliD. In case Roomi gets hacked, know that your data is secure as it is not kept on Roomi servers. On top of the GDPR, Roomi users can enjoy secure in-app messaging to contact potential roommates without sharing personal info.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you"><strong>So, which is the best room finder for you?</strong></h2>



<p>With all the features mentioned above, we hope this comparative Roomi review and Apartment List review helps you as you move to a new city. We know, no matter how many times you move, it never gets any easier. But having the technology to speed up the process of finding a place and roommates definitely helps. Especially when you know it invests in safety and data privacy, as well as affordable pricing. Knowing your data and transactions are protected gives you undeniable peace of mind.</p>



<p>This is why Apartment List alternative Roomi is naturally the best room finder out there. It ensures real people are signed into the app, keeps in-app messaging secure, and uses a state-of-the-art digital identity platform to add an additional layer of security. Plus, you can benefit from using the app whether as a free or paid user. You get the leads that you want and the peace of mind that you deserve.</p>



<p>As an all-in-one app offering all of these features and more to help you find the best room, Roomi is clearly the best room finder for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving to a big city is exciting, but it can also be a stressful experience, especially if you’re relocating to a new country. Looking for a new place to live, figuring out your transport routes, and so on, can be tiresome. This is why having a room finder to help you out is a great idea. Choosing the best website to find rooms for rent can be confusing because of the number of options available online. Here, we’ve compared Roomi and PadMapper to give you an idea of what each offers. With this information at your fingerprints, you can then choose the best room finder for you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re looking for a room, you probably already have an idea of the kind of things that are important to you. For example, you may want to live in an apartment that allows pets and smoking. Or if you&#8217;re looking for a roommate, maybe someone who&#8217;s quiet, non-smoking, and has no pets. Speaking to several roommates or landlords can become an exhausting process. This is why you should use a room finder to help you filter out things from the get-go and make the whole process simpler! We’ve explored the most basic features any good room finder should have and compared Roomi and PadMapper across each of them. Read on to learn more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No fee apartments</h3>



<p>The PadMapper app and website have a filter called “no broker fee” which allows you to view listings with no additional fees on top of your rent. On Roomi, however, all listings are no-fee! That means you&#8217;ll know exactly what the room costs, with no hidden extras.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Both room finder portals allow you to filter listings by whether they’re pet-friendly. However, PadMapper only lets you select either cat or dog-friendly properties. Roomi goes one step beyond this and enables you to choose listings that allow other pets too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>While you can sublet through PadMapper, you follow the same process as messaging the lister through the portal. Roomi helps you to sublet safely, by allowing you to request potential roommates to complete background checks. You can also directly chat with them securely through the app or website.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>The PadMapper interface allows you to filter amenities by typing out the amenity that you&#8217;re looking for, e.g. a washing machine. However, this quickly becomes tiring when you&#8217;ve got a lot of preferences to add. In contrast, Roomi has over fifteen amenities already listed that you can simply tick to filter your listings by!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type</h3>



<p>Both room finder portals allow you to filter rooms based on listing type. But like almost every point on this list, Roomi has that one little extra thing that pushes it ahead. In this case, with Roomi you can also filter by shared room or private room in addition to the whole place. PadMapper, on the other hand, only allows you to pick between different property types.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>

<p>Here’s an interesting feature that is actually super helpful but unfortunately not found on PadMapper. Roomi gives you a list of over ten house rules you can choose from to filter your searches. This will help you make sure that you and your potential roommates are on the same page before you agree to move in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-are-these-room-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are these room finder apps free or paid?</h2>



<p>Like with anything you’re using to help you, it’s important to keep in mind the monetary investment you’ll be putting in and whether it’s worth it. We’ve taken a look at the costs of using the Roomi and PadMapper app to confirm whether they’re free or paid, and what the advantages of each plan are. With all of these details, we hope you’ll be able to settle on the best website to find rooms for rent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>PadMapper is a free, map-based room finder. While it doesn’t have a paid option, it takes apartment listings from other websites like Airbnb and ForRent and puts them on a map in the radius you’re looking in. There aren’t any costs to sign up and you can view all the listings you want. Roomi on the other hand has paid and free versions. In the free version, Roomi allows all users to sign up and post listings for free. It&#8217;s also free to search through the listings to rent. The paid version also allows you to activate up to two listings a day on the platform itself!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-App Messaging</h3>



<p>On PadMapper, there’s no way to submit an application directly on the website. Instead, you can only contact the lister directly, which makes the process less safe. In the free version of Roomi, you can send up to five messages or swipes a day. What’s more, with the paid Roomi Gold subscription at just $29.99 a month, you can choose between personal and business accounts. As a personal account holder, you can send unlimited messages, ID verification, and the highlight – a ranking boost that allows you to view seven times as many ratings! With the number of features you get with the Gold plan, investing is definitely worth it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How Do These Apps Ensure That The Listings Are Credible?</h2>

<p>If you’re moving to a whole new city, safety is one of the key aspects you want to keep in mind. You should always ensure that the room finder website or app you use to find accommodation considers this aspect. Whether it comes to trustworthy renters, roommates, or localities, it pays to do your research.</p>



<p>To check that you are a real person, PadMapper asks you to connect your Facebook account for verification. Roomi takes a few more steps to make sure you and your details are safe. Firstly, the team only shows you rooms listed by people whose contact details have been properly verified. Listers have multiple options to choose from to verify their profiles and the level of verification is displayed for you to see. Secondly, if you feel something’s wrong with a listing, you can report it to Roomi’s 24/7 moderation team. All in all, it’s a great interface that keeps your privacy and safety top priority!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?</h2>



<p>Using a room finder is great to make your life easier when you are hunting for a place to live in a new city! The best website to find rooms for rent is the one that helps you find everything you need in one place, with minimal effort on your end. Such room finders may appear impossible to find, but through this article, you’ve probably realized that’s not the case.</p>



<p>While PadMapper seems to be an easy interface to find room listings on, it definitely struggles to compete with the wide array of features offered by Roomi. To sum up, with Roomi you can rest assured that your room has the exact amenities you need and that your private details are safe.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-how-do-these-room-finders-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: How do these room finders help you find your perfect room?</h2>

<p>An online room finder should filter by location, amenities, apartment types, price range and more. This means a user can simply jump on and input their preferences, making room finding fast, easy and stress-free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No-fee apartments</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re a mover, your primary aim should be to search for listings on a reliable room finder. All listings on Roomi are no-fee, meaning that the Lister doesn&#8217;t charge an extra fee based on the percentage of the rent. StreetEasy, however, has mandated that its users pay a broker fee.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>



<p>You can&#8217;t leave your furry or feathery best friends behind, which is why there&#8217;s a pet-friendly filter on Roomi. There are distinct pet categories, where you can choose apartments suitable for dogs, cats or other pets. StreetEasy also provides the option to search pet-friendly apartments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Roomi is an easy-to-use room finder and roommate finding platform that allows you to sublet rooms safely, and find roommates who are perfect for you. StreetEasy also provides these same features, but it solely bases its services in New York City. Roomi operates in multiple cities in the United States and also boasts a wider international presence, available in countries like Mexico, Canada, and more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>StreetEasy has a couple of amenities filters, but Roomi has covered <em>all</em> bases when it comes to filtering your search for apartments. Do you want to know whether a particular room has WiFi, air conditioning, private bathrooms, and other vital utilities? Well, you can find that out on your room search, without even stepping foot outside your door.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering rooms based on listing type (entire place/shared rooms)</h3>



<p>Roomi also allows users to filter listings based on the place they want to live in. For example, a couple that lives together would be able to browse for listings on the Roomi website and find a room suitable for a couple to share. StreetEasy, on the other hand, doesn&#8217;t provide this feature, so couples might run into more issues if they want to live together.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>



<p>Everyone has their preferences, and most people want to live with roommates that have similar values and lifestyles as they do. With this in mind, Roomi allows you to filter choices for potential roommates. You can filter roommate searches based on age, gender and house rules — the pet-friendly filter comes in useful here, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?</h2>



<p>No one wants to fork out high fees for a room finder that doesn&#8217;t offer the best features. The great thing about Roomi is that they consider your needs first, and so they offer wonderful features at affordable prices. Here are some features that make Roomi stand out from StreetEasy, as one of the best websites to find rooms for rent.</p>



<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/faq/is-roomi-free-to-use/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Roomi free to use?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="free-listings">Free listings</h3>



<p>All Roomi users have 2 free credits that can be used to either create 2 listings or activate any pending or deactivated listings. It’s absolutely free to search for a room to rent. However, to get the best out of Roomi, subscribing to the Gold Package comes with several tantalizing benefits. That includes access to unlimited messages with potential roomies, a ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile, and more. The subscription also comes with an optional background check, an extra step to guarantee your safety. The Gold subscription is priced at $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-app messaging</h3>



<p>Roomi, the StreetEasy alternative, offers secure in-app messaging to its users, keeping information shared between potential roomies private. Users can also request for Roomi to delete personal information after they&#8217;ve found a roommate match. They can do so under the General Data Protection Regulation by contacting Roomi customer support, or by filling a form. With Roomi, you can also message any lister for free &#8211; a feature that&#8217;s not available on StreetEasy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?</h2>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Roomi, the StreetEasy alternative, takes its users&#8217; privacy and security seriously. Your listing address is not visible to others on Roomi. Instead, the app provides an approximate location for listings in public search results.</p>



<p>Roomi makes sure that only real people with an actual room for rent can list a room on Roomi. Hence, most listers on Roomi verify their account by providing a copy of their lease, utility bill or government-issued ID. You will see certain badges on a user&#8217;s listing that showcases the forms of verification they have provided. The Security and Safety Team will also require verification of the address from the room lister.</p>



<p>Roomi has an in-house content moderation team that reviews listings and profiles for behavior that violates any of the Roomi policies, and you can report questionable users or listings too.</p>



<p>StreetEasy, in a bid to protect users from fake listings, does a background check on all proposed listings before posting it on their site. They also allow users to report suspicious listings. However, their customer service is not as extensive as Roomi&#8217;s and there may be a longer wait for a reply.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that a good room finder makes all the difference when setting out on your apartment hunt. StreetEasy is great for finding rooms, but Roomi makes the process a lot easier for you. They offer free services as well as paid services, like background checks, identity verifications, messaging plans, listing credits, profile boosts, and listing boosts.</p>



<p>Unlike Roomi, StreetEasy charges broker fees, a feature that has not fared well with its users, as many StreetEasy reviews show. And, considering the no-fee apartments feature, and wide variety of amenities and house rules filters, there&#8217;s no doubt that Roomi is the best room finder for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Having a roommate to split bills with can be helpful, especially in a new city. But with the many roommate finders available, which one can <em>actually</em> help you find an appropriate roommate? Well, you don&#8217;t have to look too far! Here&#8217;s a rundown of two roommate finders: Facebook and Roomi. We&#8217;ll be talking about and comparing the features of both apps, the pricing, and the level of security that it can provide its users. So, if you&#8217;re unsure whether to find roommates on Facebook or another app, read on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are These Roommate Finder Apps Free or Paid?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

	</div>
	


<p>Both Roomi and Facebook are free-to-use, but some features may be a deal-breaker when it comes to finding roommates. For one, there&#8217;s a risk of your private information leaking on Facebook as the app has been known to have security issues. Facebook also has no safety net due to listings and groups being managed by random people, and there&#8217;s no guarantee that the listings are genuine. So, you have to be on constant lookout for scams.</p>



<p>Whereas, with Roomi, you&#8217;d see not only verified users but also secure in-app messaging, content moderation, and background checks! Moreover, you can subscribe to become a Roomi Gold user for only $23.99 per month or $14.99 per week. With a Roomi Gold subscription, you can upgrade your status to Fully Verified (with a badge on your profile!). This means your profile and listings will be boosted up to 7x more so you have more chances of finding your roomie quickly, and you don&#8217;t have to pay a booking fee!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust">Security: Can these apps help me find roommates I can trust?</h2>

<p>Having a roommate is ideal when moving to a new place if you want to split costs, or simply don&#8217;t want to live alone. But you have to make sure you have safe roomies with whom you feel comfortable. So, it&#8217;s best to use roommate finders that verify their users, conduct background checks, and keep your private information secure. With these features, you&#8217;ll find safe roomies in no time!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="verifies-roommate-contact-info">Verifies Roommate Contact Info</h3>



<p>Roomi uses <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002123258--qu%C3%A9-es-globalid-" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GlobalID</a> as one way to verify its user&#8217;s contact information. It&#8217;s a digital identity platform that confirms and stores a user&#8217;s email and contact information, keeping it safe and secure. Additionally, it lets you control your identity and verifications, so other people can&#8217;t access your data easily.</p>



<p>Finding roommates on Facebook may be risky because Facebook doesn&#8217;t indicate that the profiles are verified. Many listings can show up with a simple roommate search on Facebook, but it&#8217;s also possible that the contact information posted may be false.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="id-verification">ID Verification</h3>



<p>Many roommate finders similar to Facebook marketplace don&#8217;t have a verified badge on regular profiles (only businesses, official organizations, and celebrities have them). This means that you won&#8217;t be able to distinguish whether a profile was made by a real person or not. So, roommates on Facebook have the potential to be fake or scammers. But with Roomi, users go through a comprehensive verification process to ensure that all profiles are made by real people. You can even get a Fully Verified badge on your profile with a Roomi Gold subscription!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="privacy-security-of-profiles">Privacy &amp; Security of Profiles</h3>



<p>Roomi takes the private and personal information of its users seriously. For one, Roomi has secure in-app messaging, so you won&#8217;t have to worry about any leak of your private messages from the app. On top of that, once you log in to the app or website, your personal information is automatically protected under the <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44002273251-deleting-my-data-under-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPDR</a>. With this, you can request your profile and data to be deleted once you&#8217;ve found your roomie.</p>



<p>In contrast, Facebook has been known to have problems when it comes to the safekeeping of the privacy and security of its users. With ever-changing privacy controls, there are many reports on Facebook users being confused about how to keep their information private on the app.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="24-7-support-content-moderation">24/7 Support &amp; Content Moderation</h3>



<p>One of the things Facebook is not known for is its content moderation because anyone with a profile can freely post anything they want on the platform. Although there&#8217;s always the option to report a listing or a post, it&#8217;s still not 100% percent clean of non-genuine listings. However, Roomi has its own in-house content moderation team responsible for picking out bad listings and clearing spam content.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="criminal-background-check">Criminal Background Check</h3>



<p>One of the many features Roomi has that makes it the best roommate finder is its criminal background checks. Upon request, Roomi does background checks against local and international criminal databases. A verified badge can be given to the user by submitting a photo of their ID. This is granted that they&#8217;re clear of any crime. With a verified badge, the chances of finding a roommate are much higher. And, with a Roomi Gold subscription, you can get a Fully Verified badge yourself!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-profiles-which-app-makes-it-easier-to-find-your-perfect-roommate">User Profiles: Which App Makes It Easier to Find Your Perfect Roommate?</h2>



<p>Your roommate search on Facebook can be tricky if you&#8217;re not entirely knowledgeable about the app itself. Since everything can be listed in Facebook marketplace, you&#8217;d have to search for what you&#8217;re looking for specifically and then choose a listing that looks trustworthy enough before inquiring. Hence, there are a lot of hoops you have to jump through when finding roommates on Facebook. On the other hand, with Roomi&#8217;s easy-to-navigate and straightforward app and website, you&#8217;ll be able to find a roommate easily!</p>



<p>In Roomi, you can use filters to fit your preferences. Like, if you prefer to live with a non-binary roommate or maybe someone a bit older than you, you just have to set the appropriate filter, and Roomi will narrow down your choices. Plus, Roomi has a roommate matching algorithm that works wonders to help you find the most appropriate roommate for you!</p>

<p>There are many roommate finders available, but only a select few can actually provide the features you need to find the best roommate. Luckily, Roomi has everything!

<p>Picture this: you&#8217;re moving to a new city, you don&#8217;t know many people, you&#8217;re trying to stay within your budget, and on top of that, you&#8217;re looking for a good apartment. These problems may have discouraged you in the past, but in these modern times, there are easier ways to find rooms for rent. With websites like Rent<a href="http://Rent.com" class="broken_link">.</a>com and Roomi, apartment hunting becomes smoother. However, between Rent.com and the Rent.com alternative, Roomi, which is the best room finder? Let&#8217;s find out!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?</h2>



<p>The perfect room finder is supposed to have all the features that make apartment hunting a breeze. Filters like price ranges and listings are among the many that can determine the best room finder for you. You may have come into contact with one or two Rent<a href="http://Rent.com" class="broken_link">.</a>com reviews, but we&#8217;re going to break down everything you need to know below.</p>



<p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/roomis-guide-for-the-first-time-renter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi&#8217;s Guide for the First Time Renter</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No fee apartments</h3>



<p>You probably don&#8217;t want to use your hard-earned money to pay broker fees. Well, you&#8217;re in luck because all Roomi listings are no fee, meaning you won&#8217;t have to fork out money from your budget to pay brokers.</p>



<p>Rent.com, however, can&#8217;t boast of this advantage, making Roomi a great Rent.com alternative.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-Friendly Apartments</h3>



<p>If you have a furry companion, you certainly have to consider them while searching for apartments. While Rent.com only offers cats and dogs pet filters, Roomi goes further by providing a filter for other pets, so nothing with fur, scales or feathers has to be left behind!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Rent.com reviews have shown that subletting with the room finder can be a hectic task. Users have to pay a big chunk of money and may have to wait months for their listing to get chosen. What makes Roomi one of the best room finders out there is the fact that it lets you browse through authentic listings by individuals who are verified. You&#8217;re also allowed to have at least 2 active listings on Roomi at any one time, which simplifies the subletting process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>Everyone has their preferences, and nobody wants a room-finding portal that doesn&#8217;t consider your needs. Both Roomi and Rent.com provide their users with an extensive list of amenities filters, where they can choose what they want according to their taste.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-based-on-listing-type-entire-rooms-shared-rooms">Filtering based on listing type (entire rooms/shared rooms)</h3>



<p>With Roomi, you&#8217;re allowed to filter through listing types. For example, if you want a roommate, you&#8217;ll be on the hunt for shared rooms. Roomi has got you covered in that aspect.</p>



<p>Rent.com doesn&#8217;t offer this feature. Many Rent.com reviews have also complained that some listings on the website are not current.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on house rules</h3>



<p>In our Roomi vs Rent.com comparison, Roomi takes the lead yet again. Roomi lets you filter rooms based on house rules, making your search easier and more convenient. If you have specific preferences like not wanting a roommate who smokes, then Roomi can help you arrange that.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?</h2>



<p>Nothing easy comes cheap, but Roomi strives to break that notion. You can do so much on Roomi for free, but subscribing to the premium plan will make your search that much easier.</p>



<p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/is-roomi-free-to-use/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Roomi free to use?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>Before going into the benefits of Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription plan, let&#8217;s talk about what you stand to gain for free. It&#8217;s free to sign up for Roomi, and you can also have 2 active listings. Some websites like Rent<a href="http://Rent.com" class="broken_link">.</a>com charge their customers for creating an account for listing, and on Rent.com, you&#8217;ll have to shell out a big sum of money to list an apartment.</p>



<p>The Roomi Gold membership allows you to increase your listings, or buy listing credits. It&#8217;s priced at $29.99 per month and $14.99 per week. This comes with goodies like free bookings, access to unlimited messages, an optional background check, and more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-app Messaging</h3>



<p>What makes Roomi stand out as one of the best room finders is the fact that you can easily connect with listers through the in-app messaging system. As mentioned earlier, you can send unlimited messages with the Roomi Gold plan.</p>



<p>Rent.com, on the other hand, allows you to contact listers by calls or emails, but many Rent.com reviews have shown that customers don&#8217;t get a response as quickly as they&#8217;d like.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>A good room finder places your safety and security as a top priority. Roomi, the Rent.com alternative, allows you to report suspected fake listings to their in-house content moderation team. Listers also have to go through a verification process to ensure that they are legit.</p>



<p>Roomi also ensures maximum security by not allowing your listing address to be visible to others, and only showing an approximate location.</p>



<p>Rent.com has a contact support team, but they only work during business hours and are not always timely in solving customer issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, which is the best room finder for you?</h2>



<p>If someone asks you, &#8216;Roomi vs Rent.com: which is better?&#8217;, the clear answer is Roomi. Roomi offers so many features that websites like Rent.com don&#8217;t, making it one of the best room finders on the market.</p>



<p>From extensive room filters to efficient safety measures, there&#8217;s no doubt that Roomi is an excellent Rent.com alternative.</p>

<p>The internet is a giant ocean of Facebook groups, Craiglist listings, and Google ads. If you&#8217;ve swum your way here, chances are that you&#8217;ve struck out on many of these websites. Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;re not out of luck! When you&#8217;re on the hunt to find rooms to rents, there are several questions that might pop up. Is the listing legitimate? Will the new apartment be pet-friendly? Are there rooms with private bathrooms? This is where Roomi comes in. <strong>In this guide, we&#8217;ll walk you through the best room finder, Roomi, and why it&#8217;s the most wonderful Apartments.com alternative!</strong></p>

<p>Roomi&#8217;s algorithm is designed to help you find your ideal room in seconds. While moving into a new neighborhood is a tedious task, finding rooms for rent shouldn&#8217;t be. This best Apartments.com alternative comes with basic filters such as price and location, but also more advanced filters to narrow down your search. Let&#8217;s take a look below at how these two-room finders fare side by side.</p>

<p>A furry companion is like a family member. You can&#8217;t imagine your life without your pet, and with Roomi, you don&#8217;t have to! Fortunately, both Roomi and Apartments.com offer pet-friendly listings. However, if your companion isn&#8217;t a canine or a feline, you&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to find a listing on Apartments.com. The website only allows the filters of &#8220;Cat Friendly&#8221; and &#8220;Dog Friendly&#8221;. Meanwhile, Roomi strives to make your experience in a new rental comfortable and accessible to pets of all kinds. This great Apartments.com alternative offers three filters for pets: &#8220;Dogs OK&#8221;, &#8220;Cats OK&#8221;, and &#8220;Other Pets OK&#8221;. So, whether you have a pet bird or a pet tortoise, you can easily find listings on Roomi!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering Rooms Based on Amenities</h3>



<p>Would you like an on-site security guard for safety? Are you looking for an apartment with power backup? Whatever your wishes might be, Roomi is your genie! While Apartments.com also has advanced filters, you&#8217;ll notice that these are less thorough than Roomi&#8217;s.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering Rooms Based on Listing Type (Entire Place/Shared Rooms)</h3>



<p>Are you looking to find rooms to rent as a couple? Do you want to save money by sharing a room? The powerful Apartments.com alternative, Roomi, offers the following filters for your privacy and budgeting needs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Entire Place</li><li>Private Room</li><li>Shared Room</li></ul>



<p>However, while Apartments.com allows for filtering based on listing type, they are a tad harder to navigate and pin down. Cue lots of frustrated mouse tapping.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering Rooms Based on House Rules</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re a college student or ever were one, the mention of house rules might give you dorm room flashbacks. However, it&#8217;s important to remember that you&#8217;ll be staying in someone else&#8217;s property. For this reason, Roomi has a comprehensive checklist of house rules that you can tick off to lead you to your perfect room. Don&#8217;t want to bunk in a house that allows smoking? Tick! Want an en-suite bathroom? Tick!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apartments.com has the option to filter listings broadly categorised under &#8220;Lifestyle&#8221;. This limited list includes only five lifestyle options: Student, Short-Term, Corporate Housing, Military Housing, Senior Housing. Here, Roomi is the clear winner to find rooms for rent based on the nitty-gritty details that are important to you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No-Fee Apartments</h3>



<p>All listings are no-fee on the best room finder, Roomi. What does this mean? It means you can start browsing and viewing listings for free! Similarly, Apartments.com also offers no-fee listings. However, as we&#8217;ve seen above, Roomi&#8217;s comprehensive and thoughtful checklist makes the room finder the best Apartments.com alternative there is!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Are you looking to make some money on the side? Subletting is a wonderful way to establish a passive channel of income for yourself. However, the process is often tricky to navigate. Basically, you&#8217;ll be renting out a space within the space you&#8217;ve rented. This means that the subtenant signs a lease with you, rather than with your landlord. Fortunately, the best room finder Roomi makes subletting easy peasy, lemon squeezy!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which App Offers the Best Free and Paid Features?</h2>



<p>You&#8217;ll come to find that Roomi offers free members a lot more than they would find on other websites such as Apartments.com. With Roomi, you can find rooms for rent for free! Want a little bit more? You can also unlock more features with affordable paid plans.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Free Members on Roomi:</strong> Free to download and sign up to activate listings for rent.</li><li><strong>Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription:</strong> The Gold Subscription is available at $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week. You can choose to pay monthly or weekly, depending on your budget.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s dive in to explore the free and paid plans on Roomi which make it the best Apartments.com alternative!</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p><strong>Roomi offers an easy way to find the perfect room for rent free of charge.</strong> It&#8217;s quick and free to post a listing, search listings, and contact two listings in any location Roomi covers. However, if you&#8217;re looking for more features, you might want to consider signing up to Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription. <strong>With Roomi Gold, here&#8217;s what you get:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings!</li><li>5 active listings to post all the empty rooms in your apartment.</li></ul>



<p>However, <a href="http://Apartments.com" class="broken_link">Apartments.com</a> is an online apartment marketplace of listings compiled from third-party portals. This makes advertising listings on the website complicated and expensive, with the possible threat of private information leaks.</p>



<p><strong>Ready to list a room with the best room finder, Roomi?

<p>The powerful Aparments.com alternative allows you to message listings and set up times for apartment viewings, all for free! On Roomi, the free plan also lets you ask questions to get a better feel for the place you&#8217;re interested in.</p>



<p><strong>With Roomi&#8217;s Gold subscription, you have access to the super helpful features below:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Access to unlimited messages with potential roomies. (On mobile, you also get unlimited swipes!)</li><li>A Fully Verified status upgrade which gets you 5x more messages!</li></ul>



<p>However, Apartments.com is a subsidiary of the larger corporation of CoStar. This means that your messages are routed to a third-party service provider. Websites like Apartments.com aren&#8217;t the best portals for in-app communication because they can compromise your cybersecurity. <strong>In this comparison, Roomi shines as the best room finder!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-listings-are-credible">Security: How Do These Apps Ensure That Listings Are Credible?</h2>



<p>Most websites like Apartments.com fall short of Roomi when it comes to vigorous data monitoring. Roomi thoroughly screens user profiles, encrypts your data, and deletes your account if you want them to.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi is committed to your physical and cyber security in three significant ways:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>ID Verification</strong>: Verifying accounts is a friendly way to make sure the person living in the apartment you’re about to rent from is credible. This account verification process includes providing a copy of your lease, utility bill, or government-issued ID.</li><li><strong>Location Protection:</strong> Roomi never shows your exact address on the platform. Instead, only your approximate location is visible to other users.</li><li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> The best room finder has a 24&#215;7 in-house content moderation team to weed out scammers and fraudulent profiles. Furthermore, if you&#8217;re having doubts about a listing or a user, you can always contact <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/home" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi&#8217;s support team.</a></li></ol>



<p>On the other hand, as mentioned above, Apartments.com is one of the brands under the major real-estate organization, CoStar. CoStar&#8217;s privacy policies clearly state that they might use your personal information for their third-party service providers. <strong>Therefore, when it comes down to your security while browsing rooms for rent, Roomi is the best room finder.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for a home, you want to feel safe and secure when sharing your information. Roomi grants you complete control of your data, while vetting listings rigorously. Ultimately, what makes Roomi the best Apartments.com alternative is the comprehensive checklist of features. You can filter based on amenities, pet-friendly listings, house rules, and so much more! <strong>Say hello to your new room genie, Roomi, and have fun browsing for your perfect room!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are hundreds of platforms to find rooms for rent online, including the minefield of Craigslist listings and Facebook groups. However, if you&#8217;re reading this, chances are that you haven&#8217;t had any luck yet, or you&#8217;ve run into some trouble. How can you browse rooms for rent online while protecting yourself from scammers? Will your new home be pet-friendly? Are you moving to a new city by yourself or as a couple? This is where Roomi comes in! This room finder is an all-in-one platform that simplifies your search for rooms with advanced filters as well as access to safe and credible listings. <strong>In this guide, we&#8217;ll walk you through the pricing plans and features of Roomi vs. Zillow and show you why Roomi is the best Zillow alternative!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-have-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What Filters &amp; Preferences Do These Room Finders Have to Help you Find your Perfect Room?</h2>



<p>Moving to a new city can be an overwhelming experience, but finding a room for rent shouldn&#8217;t be. Roomi&#8217;s algorithm is designed for you to find the room of your dreams, with basic filters such as location and price, and other advanced filters that suit your lifestyle. The powerful Zillow alternative has a comprehensive checklist that you can tick off to suit your preferences!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s find out how these room finders fare side by side.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-Friendly Apartments</h3>



<p>If you have a pet, you probably can&#8217;t imagine leaving your furry friend behind when you move to a new city. Luckily, both Zillow and Roomi offer pet-friendly apartment listings. However, Zillow only offers to accommodate cats and dogs. Roomi, on the other hand, has three different categories for pet-friendly listings &#8211; &#8220;Dogs OK&#8221;, &#8220;Cats OK&#8221;, and &#8220;Other Pets OK&#8221;. ****</p>



<p>So, whether you have a pet hamster or a pet tortoise, this great Zillow alternative lets you bring them along for the ride.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering Rooms Based on Amenities</h3>



<p>Do you want free Wifi included in your new rental? Would you love an on-site gym? Are you looking for a rental with its own security guard? With the best room finder, Roomi, your wishes will be granted! So, from elevators to private bathrooms, the powerful Zillow alternative makes your transition into your new rental easier.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Zillow also has advanced filter options, but they&#8217;re not as impressive or thorough as those on Roomi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering Rooms Based on Listing Type (Entire Place/Shared Rooms)</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re moving with your partner, you might want an entire place for privacy. If you&#8217;re looking to save money on rent, maybe you&#8217;d prefer a shared room. Whatever your preference might be, Roomi offers the following filter options based on listing type:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Entire Place</li><li>Private Room</li><li>Shared Room</li></ul>



<p>However, navigating Zillow&#8217;s rooms for rents based on listing types on Zillow is a little bit more complicated, giving Roomi the upper hand in this comparison.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering Rooms Based on House Rules</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that even if you&#8217;ve chosen to rent an entire place, you don&#8217;t own the rental. You&#8217;re living on someone else&#8217;s property and they might have rules that restrict your lifestyle. The best room finder portal, Roomi, has a simple and comprehensive checklist of filters you can tick off. For example, would you prefer living in a no-smoking apartment? Check! Do you want to live in a rental where you&#8217;re allowed to drink? Check!</p>



<p>However, Zillow doesn&#8217;t have the checklist feature of filtering rooms based on house rules. This is a clear disadvantage as compared to the best room finder, Roomi, because you have to manually input each keyword to narrow your search &#8211; which can be a tedious process.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No-Fee Apartments</h3>



<p>On Roomi, all listings are no-fee. What does this mean? You can start viewing and uploading listings for free! Zillow also offers the feature to browse listings for free. However, as we&#8217;ve seen above, Roomi is a wonderful Zillow alternative to find rooms for rent, providing all these extra features at no extra price!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Subletting is often tricky, because you&#8217;re renting a space to another person within the space you&#8217;ve rented for yourself. This means that the subtenant signs an agreement with you, rather than the landlord. Sounds complicated? Don&#8217;t worry, both Roomi and Zillow have simplified the process of subletting for their users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which App Offers the Best Free and Paid Features?</h2>



<p>The big move to a new city is expensive enough, especially if you factor in moving-in fees and setting up utilities. You don&#8217;t want to blow your budget by shelling out more money on a room finder portal. With Roomi, you can find rooms for rent for free, and also unlock premium features at affordable subscription plans!</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Free Members on Roomi:</strong> Free to sign up and activate listings for rent.</li><li><strong>Roomi&#8217;s Gold Subscription:</strong> The Gold Subscription is available at $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week. You have the flexibility to choose whether to pay monthly or weekly depending on your budget.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s dive in to take a closer look at what Roomi offers on their free plan compared to the Gold Subscription.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>On Roomi, you can post an advertisement for a place to rent completely free of charge! Similarly, it&#8217;s free to browse rooms for rent. On top of that, you can contact up to two listings for free in any of the locations that Roomi covers. If you want more features to narrow your search and find the perfect room, here&#8217;s what you get with Roomi&#8217;s Gold plan:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile and listings.</li><li>5 active listings to post all the empty rooms in your apartment.</li></ul>



<p>On the other hand, Zillow now asks its members to sign up for their Zillow Rental Manager. Even though your first listing is free, this is only applicable to one account per household. After that, every other listing comes at a price of $9.99 per week. Unlike Zillow, the powerful Zillow alternative, Roomi provides a flat rate for a variety of extra features.</p>



<p><strong>List a room with the best room finder, Roomi, with the help of this <a href="https://roomiapp.freshdesk.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44000214340-how-do-i-create-a-listing-">wonderfully easy guide</a>!</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-App Messaging</h3>



<p>You can message listings and set up times to view apartments for free on Roomi. The free plan also allows you to ask questions and get a better feel for the place you&#8217;re interested in. Additionally, if you&#8217;re looking for more features, here&#8217;s what Roomi Gold offers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Access to unlimited messages with potential roomies. (On mobile, you also get unlimited swipes!)</li><li>A Fully Verified status upgrade which gets you 5x more messages.</li></ul>



<p>However, Zillow does not have direct control over the communication between a listing provider and potential tenant, so there can be delays in communication. This leaves users at a greater risk of cybersecurity scams because of a lack of secure in-app messaging. <strong>In this comparison, Roomi shines as the best room finder!</strong></p>

<p>Roomi’s reputation as the best room finder is in part thanks to its commitment to privacy and security. Roomi protects you and your information by keeping everything anonymous, not sharing info with other users or companies, encrypting your data, and deleting your account if you ask them to.</p>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s take a closer look below at how the best Zillow alternative protects you:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The verification of accounts is a user-friendly way to make sure the person living in the apartment you’re about to rent from is who they say they are. This verification process involves providing a copy of your lease, utility bill, or government-issued ID.</li><li>Your listing address isn’t visible on the Roomi app. Instead, only an approximate location is shown.</li><li>Roomi&#8217;s in-house content moderation team will review any listing or profile that violates community guidelines. Additionally, if you want to report users, you can contact Roomi&#8217;s trust and safety team.</li></ul>



<p>Zillow&#8217;s content moderation isn&#8217;t as rigorous as Roomi&#8217;s. However, the platform allows you to report possible fraudulent listings by clicking &#8220;Report Listing&#8221; on the page. In sum, this great Zillow alternative is committed to your physical and cyber security with strict guidelines and the instant reporting of scams.</p>

This powerful Zillow alternative does this effortlessly, while making sure that you have fun searching for your new home!</p>
