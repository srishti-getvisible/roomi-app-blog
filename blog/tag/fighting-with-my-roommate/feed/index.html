										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;re fighting with your roommate, you end up feeling just as bad as fighting with your significant other, your best friend or your mom. When you’re living with someone – day-in, day-out – and you could cut the tension with a blunt knife, it can really get you down. Often, you can avoid fighting with your roommate by making sure you include these&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/2017/08/16/4-things-include-roommate-agreement/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">4 house rules in your roommate agreement</a>.</p>



<p>But when it’s too late, the house rules are being ignored, or the fight is about something else entirely, what can you do?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-before-diving-into-conflict-resolution-try-self-reflection">1. Before diving into conflict resolution, try self reflection</h2>



<p>Firstly, try to take a step back and look at the situation objectively. Are you known for your stubbornness? Have you had a fight with friends in the past for a similar reason? You might be able to resolve the conflict by being honest with yourself and offering an apology.</p>



<p>If that’s not enough, let’s take a look at some potential reasons you&#8217;re fighting with your roommate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-you-re-fighting-with-your-roommate-because-of-unacknowledged-communication-boundaries">2. You&#8217;re fighting with your roommate because of unacknowledged communication boundaries</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9fontc/my_19m_roommate_and_i_19m_just_had_a_massive/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Flaccinator2 told Reddit</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“My roommate seems to be offended by nearly everything I say to him. How do I move forward so I can be comfortable in my apartment without having to be on guard around him?”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Whether you’re the offender or the offend-ee, it’s important to remember that everyone has different levels of sensitivities. So you should try to live in harmony by not pushing each other’s buttons.</p>



<p>If someone does feel like a personal attack has been made upon them, it’s healthy to discuss it. That way, both of you can learn the other’s boundaries to make <em>“Home sweet home”</em>&nbsp;a reality.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-should-you-do-if-you-are-the-offender">What should you do if you are the offender?</h3>



<p>Once someone oversteps the mark, it’s on them to initiate the make-up conversation (even if they feel like they haven’t done anything wrong.)</p>



<p>Opening the talk with something like&nbsp;<em>“I’m sorry you feel like…”</em>&nbsp;will just make them more defensive, since you’re not taking ownership of the thing you said.</p>



<p>Instead, try&nbsp;<em>“I’m sorry I offended you; I really didn’t mean to…”</em>&nbsp;and give them the opportunity to accept your apology.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-you-re-fighting-with-your-roommate-over-the-house-rules">3. You&#8217;re fighting with your roommate over the house rules</h2>



<p>There are certain (said or unsaid) house rules that you have to respect when living with roommates, that make&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/2017/07/05/share-house-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing a house in NYC</a>&nbsp;enjoyable. From paying rent on time, to keeping noise down at night and keeping the place clean, you might assume your roomi should automatically know how to behave.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. And when someone isn’t respecting expected house rules, it can lead to a blow-out amongst roommates. To avoid this, flag issues as and when they arise, using a calm and non-judgemental tone. Let your roommate know how everyone in the apartment is expected to act, and even apologize for not setting clear boundaries early on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-should-you-address-your-issues-in-a-polite-way">How should you address your issues in a polite way?</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“Hey Sam, I’m sorry I didn’t let you know this before, but I have to wake up early for work/college. The walls in the apartment are really thin, so would you mind keeping the noise down after 10 p.m.? Your TV’s usually on pretty loud; maybe you could listen to it with earphones or on a lower volume?”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-all-things-said-and-done">4. All things said and done</h2>



<p>The majority of people would rather keep the peace in their living environment. And a simple conversation about the house rules will alert them to their behavior, so they’ll make an effort to improve.</p>



<p>However, if you’ve already tried this, and you&#8217;re still fighting with your roommate, make time to resolve it in a calm, public environment (such as a bar or cafe). You could also try bringing in a neutral third person who can offer an objective view and advice about how to proceed. (This doesn’t mean getting your friends involved just so they can take your side.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-make-separation-your-last-resort">Make separation your last resort</h3>



<p>And if a roomi dispute cannot be solved, it might be best that you live apart. Speak to them before you make any concrete plans, since your desire to move might kick them into action to finally settle the fight.</p>



<p>In the end, whatever happens, take the situation and learn from it. And you might be able to spot&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/2017/06/14/roommate-red-flags/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate red flags</a>&nbsp;much more easily in future!</p>

<p>We can’t choose our family, but we <em>can </em>choose our roommate. That said, a roommate interview is similar to a first date or a job interview &#8211; we put on our brightest smile and try to give the best possible impression of ourselves. Often, it’s not until the lease has been signed and everyone has settled into their new home that the roommate problems begin to show. Maybe you find yourself stuck with a messy roommate, or maybe you&#8217;re dealing with a roommate who&#8217;s just stone-cold. </p>

<p>Before we get into anything else, here&#8217;s a little something that&#8217;ll tell you what the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/how-to-find-a-roommate-the-complete-guide/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">best way to find a roommate</a> is. But if you’ve already moved in with someone and you just hate being around them, what can you do?</p>



<p>Short of hiding out in your bedroom or moving back in with your parents, let’s check out your options based on some common situations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">They’re a messy roommate</h2>



<p>This is one of the most common roommate problems out there. Does it sound familiar to you?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“So my college dorm roommate is still as messy as ever, which I believe I have been fairly tolerant of. However, her stuff continues to flood into my space, even after I&#8217;ve brought it up to her. I like to think I&#8217;m a direct person, and not a pushover, but I don&#8217;t want to seem pushy and keep asking her to make sure she keeps her stuff in HER space. The worst part is that this wouldn&#8217;t even be a problem if she would just use all of her drawer, cabinet, desk, and closet space. It&#8217;s really driving me mad how inconsiderate she keeps acting.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/a4fuv0/messy_roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit poster ohgirlfitup</a>, you’re struggling to co-exist with a messy roommate and have already brought up the problem, what steps can you take? It’s easy to fall into a deep pit of resentment towards an inconsiderate roommate. But, bottling things up often just leads to an outburst from you (and then things get<em> really </em>messy.) </p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/OQrx03s8VwOl7XmfiZ" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/OQrx03s8VwOl7XmfiZ/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>But when talking things through doesn’t lead to the nice, neat outcome you’re hoping for, what do you do?</p>



<p><strong>Here&#8217;s some things you can try-</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Pick your battles.</strong></h3>



<p>We get it; your messy roommate has habits that make your skin itch. But complaining about everything won’t help. When dealing with a roommate, only confront them on bigger issues that truly obstruct your daily life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Assign your own spaces.</strong></h3>



<p>Determine which spaces “belong” to each of you and which are communal. If their stuff crosses into your boundary, you can simply put it back into theirs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Create a cleaning roster.</strong></h3>



<p>Write up a schedule of daily and weekly chores, so you’re splitting the cleaning tasks evenly and you’re not left feeling annoyed because you’re <em>always </em>the one to scrub the bathroom.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Their social life doesn’t match up to yours</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/7bosv7/i_hate_my_roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit user handakun</a>, was sharing a bedroom with someone that rarely left the room and didn’t seem to want to get to know her:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“Let&#8217;s call my roommate Tiffany (not her real name). She and I are both first years and we&#8217;re sharing a dorm room. When I first met her, she seemed really kind and genuine so I didn&#8217;t think much about it. However over time, I realized she doesn&#8217;t go out that much. She&#8217;s almost always in the room either watching videos, talking to her friends or family over the phone, etc. She doesn&#8217;t make any effort to get to know me or any of our hallmates.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If you’re in a similar situation, it’s time to mentally remove yourself and take an objective point-of-view. This is actually one of the better roommate problems to have. Okay; so your messy roommate parties less (or more) than you do. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re wrong for doing so. Everyone is different, and you may just need to set some boundaries between the two of you, or learn to accept that everyone lives their own life. At least, they&#8217;re not a messy roommate! </p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:100%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/1xkcamkSZKd6OKvSQN" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/1xkcamkSZKd6OKvSQN/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>As long as their lifestyle doesn’t affect your quality of living (e.g. they’re waking you up at crazy times), you can learn to live in harmony. Try taking part in activities together, such as cooking a meal, watching a TV series or inviting them out with your friends.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">They’re generally difficult to live with</h2>



<p>Sometimes, your roommate doesn’t have just one annoying habit &#8211; they have lots! On top of being a messy roommate, they sleep with the light on in your shared room. They blast music you hate. Cook smelly food and then leave a mess. And loudly blending their green smoothie at 6 a.m. there&#8217;s just no end to your roommate problems!</p>



<p>We’ve all been there. Dealing with a messy roommate who pisses you off on every level is really hard. But here&#8217;s how can deal with them better- </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Talk things out within 24 hours of a negative event to set rules and boundaries early on.</li><li>Don’t address problems when you’re already annoyed &#8211; stay cool, calm and collected.</li><li>Start the difficult conversation by apologising for not letting them know [insert roomi issue] annoys you at the beginning.</li><li>Suggest possible solutions or ways to land on some middle ground</li><li>Discuss issues in person, rather than via text messages.</li><li>Start by making a joke about the issue, to see if that fixes things up. Address it delicately and avoid veering towards sarcasm. If that doesn’t work, address it more directly. </li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You had a fight with your roommate about Timing</strong></h2>



<p>​You woke up late and your can of Axe was empty- not only did your boss yell at you but you smell. It’s been an all round bad day. Coming home and seeing the same red pot in the sink for the 3rd day in a row has broken the camel’s back and suddenly it’s HulkMania in Apt 102. Before your living room reaches WWE status, consider whether the timing of the confrontation is appropriate and you are not fueled by misdirected stress. The sooner you address the issue, the better it is. In the event that you do blow-off steam whilst confronting a roommate issue, quickly and sincerely apologize for it. Anger charged discussions accomplish nothing and you’ll end up washing the dishes out of guilt anyway.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Face to face communication</strong></h2>



<p>Roommate Facebook pages, group chat/text, and dry erase boards are all modern day platforms for asking NYC roommates to supply their share of toilet paper. When it comes to resolving a fight, discussing broken rules, or confrontation it should be done face to face with all roommates present. Often times what is said in text can be misconstrued. “No, I’m not yelling at you, I’m just really excited about toilet paper”. Avoid THAT <a href="https://climb.pcc.edu/blog/the-7-benefits-of-effective-communication-in-personal-and-professional-settings">conversation</a> by talking to each other more often. The environment of the discussion should feel safe and no single roommate attacked by the rest. So, to effectively resolve a NYC roommate fight, lose the emoji’s and call for a house meeting.</p>
