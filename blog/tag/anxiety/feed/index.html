										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on everyone across the world. Things no longer are the same as they were a year ago, and all of us found ourselves adjusting, and to different capacities struggling this past year. mental health has been a more important topic than ever, and we can all rightly say, that the conversation needs to keep evolving around the subject.</p>



<p><strong>According to Mental Health America, youth mental health is worsening. 9.7% of youth in the U.S. have severe major depression, compared to 9.2% in last year’s dataset. This rate was highest among youth who identify as more than one race, at 12.4%. Even before COVID-19, the prevalence of mental illness among adults was increasing. In 2017-2018, 19% of adults experienced a mental illness, an increase of 1.5 million people over last year’s dataset.</strong></p>



<p>While it may be that some of us are more vulnerable than others, everyone faces challenges in life that can impact our mental health. After all, just a few months ago, none of us had any idea that all our worlds would be upended by the coronavirus, and that worry, isolation, loneliness, depression, and anxiety would become collective experiences shared by literally everyone.</p>



<p>Before we get into how we can preserve our mental health, let&#8217;s get into the details of what Mental Health Awareness Month is.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can you look after your mental health and keep anxiety at bay?</h2>



<p>Here is some of the most tried and tested practical advice for anxiety that we have for you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Talk to someone who will listen.</h3>



<p>Talking about your feelings can help you stay in good mental health and deal with times when you feel troubled.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Take a walk, and keep yourself active.</h3>



<p>Regular exercise can boost your self-esteem and can help you concentrate, sleep, and feel better. It can also help you keep your anxiety in check. Exercise keeps the brain and your other vital organs healthy and is also a significant benefit towards improving your mental health. A great form of exercise is practicing yoga, straight from the comfort of your home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Take care of your diet, and add probiotics to it!</h3>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641835/#:~:text=Increasing%20evidence%20has%20associated%20gut,are%20prevalent%20in%20society%20today.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy gut</a> is proven to have great effects on people struggling with their mental health.</p>



<p>Your brain needs a mix of nutrients in order to stay healthy and function well, just like the other organs in your body. A diet that’s good for your physical health is also good for your mental health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Keep your alcohol consumption in check.</h3>



<p>Those of us that do, consume alcohol at every celebration, every sorrow. Some people drink to deal with fear or loneliness, but the effect is only temporary.</p>



<p>Difficult feelings only get worse if you try to manage them through alcohol. You&#8217;ll only end up feeling worse after the temporary numbness wears off. So keeping your alcohol consumption in check can be extremely beneficial.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don&#8217;t allow yourself to fall out of touch</h3>



<p>There’s nothing better than catching up with someone face to face, but that’s not always possible. You can also give them a call, drop them a note, or chat to them online instead. Keep the lines of communication open: it’s good for you!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Ask for help.</h3>



<p>Our world is evolving at a speed much higher than our minds, and people today are suffering with depression and anxiety more than ever before.</p>



<p>If things are getting too much for you and you feel you can’t cope, ask for help. Your family or friends may be able to offer practical help or a listening ear.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Take a break and so something you&#8217;re good at.</h3>



<p>A major cause for depression and anxiety can be commotion that we aren&#8217;t able to get away from. A change of scene or a change of pace is good for your mental health. It could be anything from a 5-minute break to a month-long pause. Take the time that you need, and maybe indulge in something you know you&#8217;re good at!</p>



<p>Enjoying yourself can help beat stress. Doing an activity you enjoy probably means you’re good at it, and achieving something boosts your self-esteem</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Accept yourself, as well as others around you.</h3>



<p>We’re all different. It’s much healthier to accept that you’re unique than to wish you were more like someone else. Feeling good about yourself boosts your confidence to learn new skills, and is a wonderful way to beat anxiety. Give yourself the time to visit new places and make new friends. Good self-esteem helps you cope when life takes a difficult turn. Similarly, caring for others is just as important. Bringing yourself close to people who you call friends can keep your spirits up, and form a supportive bond for everyone involved!</p>

<p>According to statistics from the <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://adaa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a> ,<a href="https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics#:~:text=Anxiety%20disorders%20are%20the%20most,of%20those%20suffering%20receive%20treatment.)" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Anxiety affects about 40 million adults (18 and above) in the US every year</a>. Those diagnosed with depression are often found to have an anxiety disorder as well. The uncertainty brought about by the pandemic and more recent events such as the riot on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/where-the-investigation-into-the-capitol-hill-riots-now-stands-99964485787" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capitol Hill</a> has not made matters any easier.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“As the pandemic relentlessly persists, we are seeing the highest levels of anxiety and depression reported since the pandemic hit the U.S. in March,” </em></p><cite><em>Paul Gionfriddo, president and CEO of MHA (Mental Health America)</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Mental health issues like anxiety can be brought on by several things working simultaneously. No one is totally immune, and most of the time, the condition is treatable.</p>



<p>The sooner you catch it, the easier it is to treat. The best way to keep ourselves and our loved ones healthy is to be more aware. In apartments with roommates, it is good to keep an eye on one another. Often, due to frequent lockdowns and quarantining, other support systems are cut off.</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/119838040073639409/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/119838040073639409/</a>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here are a few signs to indicate that your roommate may be having trouble with anxiety:</h2>



<p>Notice if your roommate is behaving in a manner that is not routine for him or her. These are some tell-tale signs of anxiety to look out for. It is important to note that these need to be out of the ordinary for the individual.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are they constantly tired? And have difficulty</strong> <strong>concentrating?</strong></h3>



<p>When someone is constantly anxious, his or her body produces more adrenaline. This puts them in a constant state of ‘fight or flight’ and can make sleeping difficult. So, they are more prone to being tired all the time.</p>



<p>If you suspect something, pay attention to your coliving partner. Has your roommate been forgetting what they usually wouldn&#8217;t? Are they having trouble focusing on a conversation? Anxiety prompts people to ponder excessively on negative outcomes, making it difficult for them to focus.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is their appetite off?</strong></h3>



<p>Since you’re in a shared coliving space, it may be easier for you to spot things like a drastic change in appetite. This is a physical indication of anxiety. Are you noticing that your roommate is experiencing a loss in appetite? Or is it the other extreme? Do you see your coliving companion binge eating unusually often?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Have you noticed them distancing themselves?</h3>



<p>Those who suffer from anxiety feel like avoiding or escaping situations that might make them anxious. Therefore, they have been known to spend a lot of energy devising ways to avoid these situations. If your roommate is avoiding conversations, not really keeping in touch with friends or family. These are indications that he or she is trying to isolate or distance themselves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can you do?</h2>



<p>How can you tell if it’s time for your roommate to seek professional help? As a rule of thumb, if anxiety affects your coliving partner’s daily life and routine, it might be time to consult a therapist.</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/430164201912403987/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/430164201912403987/</a>



<p>Being the one living close to your coliving partner, you would likely notice the small stuff.</p>



<p>For example, if they are avoiding social activities, work, or exercise consistently. These are strong indications that the person in your coliving space would benefit from speaking to a professional.</p>



<p>In apartments with roommates, you may not be familiar enough with one another to broach the subject yourself. In this case, get in touch with their best friend or a family member to share your concerns.</p>



<p>If you choose to speak to your roommate about it directly, remember that people often don’t seek treatment due to the stigma attached to mental healthcare. It is a delicate situation that needs to be approached with care.</p>



<p>Avoid forcing a confrontation. Instead, create a dialogue and a safe space for your friend to express his or her concerns. If you are unsure of what to say, it’s best to speak to a mental health care professional to understand how to do this.</p>

<p>It can be quite difficult to stand by and watch someone else struggle with a condition like anxiety. Whether this person is a friend or just one member of a shared apartment.</p>



<p><em><strong>You may like: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-be-a-good-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to be a Good Roommate</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you wish you could do more, here are some ways to support your roommate:</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Don’t dismiss their concerns. For someone with anxiety, some experiences can be frightening for them but not for you. Belittling their concerns by calling them small worries doesn’t actually make the anxiety stop. Instead, ask what you can do to support them.</li><li>Offer assistance but don’t take over. Helpful friends and family often forget that support is to help someone help themselves. It does not mean that you should take over tasks for your friend. In apartments with roommates, this could mean watching your friend struggle over making a decision. To support your friend, help them list out the pros and cons related to the issue but let them make the final decision on their own.</li><li>Understand more about their condition so you can avoid stereotypes and making generalizations. Educating ourselves on conditions like anxiety, depression, and so on can go a long way in destigmatizing mental health conditions.</li></ol>

<p>If a book named &#8216;How To Manage Your Raging Coronavirus Anxiety&#8217; existed, building a routine would be the first chapter. Here&#8217;s what the experts say about the importance of a routine:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Your daily routine influences your quality of rest.

<p>There&#8217;s nothing a good workout can&#8217;t beat esp. when you can&#8217;t help but stress about the coronavirus pandemic. It may sound funny, but putting physical stress on your body can relieve mental stress. Exercising has many benefits such as reduced stress hormones like cortisol, improved sleep quality, increased confidence, and a good release of endorphins. Endorphins are chemicals in your brain that elevate your mood and help with the pain. Truly the best way to get manage your stress and anxiety. So get that lazy booty out of bed and start moving!</p>

<p>How to manage anxiety? Find a fluffy friend &#8211; because the best therapist has four legs, a heart of gold, and fur! It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a dog person or a cat person, petting all animals can help release oxytocin, a brain chemical that promotes a positive mood.</p>



<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;Gazing deep into your dog&#8217;s eyes releases &#8216;Oxytocin&#8217; in both you and your pet. Which can not only make you happier but also help you combat stress and anxiety effectively. Isn&#8217;t that the cutest?</p>

<p>When the world feels like a desolate place, and everything seems meaningless, believe in someone greater than yourself. It&#8217;s the coronavirus pandemic and some of the best minds on the whole of the earth are struggling to find a way out of it, so if you&#8217;re religious, this is a great time to turn to your faith. If not, take some time out of every day to meditate &#8211; it can feel strange at first, but stick at it to experience the calming benefits.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>And Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</em></p><cite>&#8211; Mark 11:22-24</cite></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Reconnect</h2>

<p>This may seem obvious, but people just aren&#8217;t reconnecting enough right now. People suffering from long-term stress and anxiety seem to shut themselves out fearing that their friends and family won&#8217;t understand them. It&#8217;s extremely challenging for them to manage their anxiety &#8211; even the most menial tasks become cumbersome.</p>



<p>So having a close-knit circle of friends to talk with, is the most comforting experience at this time. If you, or someone you know is battling anxiety, be sure to seek or extend comfort. Let&#8217;s all be there for each other and help manage the raging stress &amp; anxiety that most of us are overlooking.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;One study found that for women in particular, spending time with friends and children helps release oxytocin, a natural stress reliever. This effect is called “tend and befriend,” and is the opposite of the fight-or-flight response.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10941275/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pubmed.gov</a></em></cite></blockquote>
