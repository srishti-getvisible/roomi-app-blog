										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s inevitable that in your &#8216;adult&#8217; life you’re going to buy useless things you don&#8217;t need. Things you waste money on and then never use again. Completely unnecessary things you think you need to buy in the moment, but forget about even before they arrive. These tips can guarantee you make a lot fewer of these purchases, to keep those dollars in check. </p>



<p>In the long run, it’s about being honest with yourself about what you really need versus what just looks good in the store/your best friend’s place/that Instagram grid. One thing we can all admit: we all have gone a little crazy with the online shopping this year!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. the most unnecessary gym equipment you think you need to buy</h2>



<p>With the quarantine and work from home being the new normal, a lot of us at the beginning got really enthusiastic about our fitness goals. And for the rare ones that actually did utilize their gym memberships prior to the pandemic, they now feel the need to recreate their entire gym experience at home.</p>



<p>Getting basic things like a good quality yoga mat, comfortable clothes to work out in and a decent pair of shoes is okay, but feeling the need to have the machinery for all the fancy things you saw on your favorite fitness blogger’s Instagram account is way too much. It is unnecessary equipment that you don&#8217;t need to buy!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>For the average person, there are various effective workouts that you can do at home using just a mat, a chair, a wall, and your own body weight. There are also plenty of awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAPCPjnU1wA" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channels that you can watch</a> for free, that go over all kinds of home workout routines that cater to whatever goals or needs you might have.</p>



<p>So, don&#8217;t invest in any fancy gym equipment. Because, believe us, in a couple of years, you will look at the same fancy equipment and wonder how you ended buying such useless things you don&#8217;t need!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Highly specific ingredients for food</h2>



<p>This one&#8217;s for all the home chefs. How much time have you spent searching for <mark>unnecessary</mark> ingredients you think you need to <mark>buy</mark> in order to make your dish perfect? If you’re someone who has gotten into looking up recipes online, you know what we&#8217;re talking about. You&#8217;ve probably come across recipes that call for very specific items that you&#8217;ll only use for that one dish. And if you’re new to cooking, it&#8217;s natural to feel the need to buy that exact item for the exciting new recipe. But most of these specific ingredients will end up being one of the useless things you don&#8217;t need in your pantry.</p>



<p>But if you commit yourself to have a basic familiarity with different ingredients, flavors, and textures, you will find that you can in fact substitute this very specific item or even sometimes go without it. Don&#8217;t let a one-time use ingredient be one of the things you waste money on!</p>

								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. New/perfectly matching furniture</h2>



<p>It’s easy to feel like your pride is wrapped up in having new things in your house. Or have everything match perfectly so that you feel like a fancy adult. It’s so easy to lust after that beautiful set of matching glass set or kitchenware. But, remember, there are also so many pretty things to be found in other places! Your local thrift stores, Goodwill, or even in neighborhood-specific Facebook groups will have some beautiful gems hidden in them! Don&#8217;t pay exorbitant amount of money on <mark>unnecessary</mark> furniture just because you think need to <mark>buy</mark> a matching set.</p>



<p>Of course, there are some furniture items that you want to be a little cautious buying secondhand. For example, anything with fabric can be dicey at a thrift store. It&#8217;s also really important that you not associate brand new with &#8216;yours&#8217;. Because something can be just as meaningful even if it’s third or fourth hand from a yard sale! Expensive furniture doesn&#8217;t have to be one of the things you waste money on!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>But all things said and done, remember to not beat yourself up over every little financial decision. The point is to think hard about what is really worth to you. And then avoid buying pointless things because our brain loves shiny, new things! </p>

<p>As it feels as though COVID-19 has put some things on hold, you may be looking for money-saving ideas for early retirement, world travel, or just an emergency fund. But come some free time paired with the luxury of E-commerce, we just can&#8217;t help flushing our money down the online shopping drain.</p>



<p>Now, with quarantine confining us to our comfortable four walls, we have the opportunity to put all those money-saving ideas to use.</p>



<p>‘It’s not that simple,’ you say? Maybe it is if you simply give it a try! Here are some easy money-saving tips for you to take that first step towards saving.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how can I save money in the times of Covid-19?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Do some basic mathematics to cut corners &amp; increase savings! </h3>



<p>For all of you wondering &#8211; &#8220;ugh, I am a spendthrift, how will I ever save money?&#8221; Fret not! Firstly, start calculating your income &amp; expenditures by asking yourself these questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>What&#8217;s my income? </li><li>How much do I need to set aside monthly for rent, food, and other necessities? </li><li>What&#8217;s my remaining balance? <br>Secondly, ask yourself how much are you willing to set aside as <em>savings.</em> Don’t be stingy. This money is for you too &#8211; the future you! Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic is literally the perfect opportunity to maximize savings. </li></ul>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. The best way to save money is to cook at home!</h3>



<p>You know how you order in and then feel two kinds of heartburn? One from indigestion, and the other one from spending unnecessarily? Put an end to your sufferings and order in, only every now and again, to reward yourself. Don’t make working from home an excuse by telling yourself you don’t have time to cook, while you watch TV. Buy groceries with your money instead and get better at cooking to stay healthy while maximizing savings in the process. </p>

	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Save money for substantial things &gt; Online shopping </h3>



<p>You’re tired after a long day, you go online and see something that really catches your eye. You decide to treat yourself for all the hard work you’ve put in. While you might get some happiness out of it, you realize it&#8217;s generally short-lived. On the other hand, if you save that money instead, you will be one step closer to your savings goal.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Make a shopping list and stick to it</h3>



<p>This is one of those money-saving ideas that reflect changes in your bank account almost immediately. Because you can’t save everything for the future. There could be some useful things that you want but never thought you had enough money for. Make a list of such things. Put the approximate price against each item. Buy as and when you can. And try and stick to your list. You will be surprised at just how much money you can save </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Open a different savings account</h3>



<p>If you don’t understand investments and bonds, you could open a different bank account for your savings. No matter how small the amount, make it a habit to transfer some money as and when you can. Do not use the card or save the details of that card on your devices and keep it aside to work towards your savings goals. Use these Covid-19 times to minimize expenditure &amp; save more money!</p>
