										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Maybe you&#8217;re a bunch of students who have just moved away from home for four years of university. Or maybe you&#8217;re at home trying to reconfigure the dynamics of living with your partner. Whatever your situation may be, chores at home can make or break any co-living situation. We aren&#8217;t kidding. And without a chore chart or cleaning schedule, you and your roommate (or partner) are bound to fight. Trust us, chore list is extremely important, especially for roommates. </p>



<p>House chores are undoubtedly tedious and tiring. Folding the dishes, doing the lawn, mowing the laundry. Wait, no. Uh, you know what we mean. No. One. Likes. This. Stuff.</p>



<p>To be able to successfully and diplomatically work through this land mine, all concerned parties just need to come together one evening (preferably over snacks, maybe some wine) and with a pen and paper, make an actual activity out of this.</p>



<p>We doubt this can be accomplished to a similar effect if just one person chalks up a chores&#8217; list on the fridge on a frustrated morning.</p>



<p>The solution lies not in the list but in the system you set up.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Have a house meeting to work out the Roommate Chore Chart  ?</h2>



<p>When drawing up the roommate chore chart, take everyone&#8217;s input. After all, you don&#8217;t want to end up with a cleaning schedule where one roommate has to do more work than the other. After a set of household tasks are on paper, go through each task, asking around the table how many people wouldn&#8217;t mind taking up that particular job &#8211; you&#8217;d be surprised to know how many people find joy in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190515-can-decluttering-your-house-really-spark-joy" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">decluttering</a> or stress relief in mowing a lawn.</p>



<p>Similarly, ask for tasks that people absolutely despise. For instance, if you&#8217;re a despiser of washing the dishes three times a week, switch a few turns out with a couple extra runs for the grocery &#8211; with maybe someone who doesn&#8217;t mind getting their hands dirty (or clean?).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Welcome to Compromise City, Population: You and the roommate chore chart</h2>



<p>The list is bound to have certain tasks that no one enjoys. For the sake of maintained harmony and minimal shade served, split the undesired tasks as evenly as possible. You could also try switching up the chores over a monthly house-meeting (mmm, we smell a tradition ?).</p>



<p>A great tip is to tackle the less fun chores together &#8211; so time goes by quicker, and the entire house gets time to bond &#8211; or as we like to call it, a <a href="http://realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/laundry/laundry-room-cleaning-checklist" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">laundry</a> cleaning party.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Pocket Full Of Everyone&#8217;s Time</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s highly unlikely that your entire household will be running on the same schedule. Some might have the regular 9-5 grind, while others might have multiple jobs, off-timed shifts and others just regular nights of constant typing. Perhaps the sharing of chores can be done to fit everyone&#8217;s schedule &#8211; depending on what everyone&#8217;s most comfortable (re: least uncomfortable) with.</p>



<p>Also understand that people&#8217;s schedules change. And a foundational understanding and mutual respect for all members of the house is more important than any thing else here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Remember, You Cannot Micromanage This.</h2>



<p>You may not be able to divide the chore list completely evenly amongst your roommates. And chances are, splitting the chores to a precise half, will only lead to resentment as things will never work out perfectly. We believe the most important thing at this junction is all parties sharing effort in maintaining your home: whatever that effort may be. The roommate chore chart will never be perfect, but it&#8217;s the effort that counts!</p>

								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do as Elsa did</h2>



<p>Let it go. We all know that one nosey friend that will run to wipe the counter behind your back&#8230; After you have already done your best to clean it. And if you don&#8217;t know that one person, chances are you&#8217;re it. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s always best to remember that even with the best intentions in mind, you cannot impose your standards on people around you. Especially those people that are actually trying. Nobody&#8217;s perfect and being appreciative of those around you goes a really long way. Just make sure you and your roommates stick to the chore list as much as you can, and forgive the rest!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Last Resort</h2>



<p>Now this very preachy piece might click for you or it may not. Either way, we are all familiar with dysfunctional days when nothing seems to go our way. Those days call for scheduling help. Many people prefer a once-a-week <a href="https://www.tidy.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep clean service</a> (that can easily be hired over the internet). It&#8217;s basically meant to help you catch up on your chores while also catching all those corners we never really find the time for. So, come up with a cleaning schedule with your roommate that works for you. </p>



<p>This gives you the peace of mind that comes with a clean home and a mighty satisfied set of housemates!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While some of us might be willing to live with life’s ills, without investing time in cleaning during quarantine, there might be some who are desperately trying to find an antidote to the shelter-in-place situation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“When all else fails, cleaning the house is the perfect antidote to most of life&#8217;s ills.” </em></p><cite><em>Sue Grafton</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>The tricky part about staying at home 24/7 is REALLY getting to know your roomis. Things you might have been willing to overlook before, come entirely into focus when you’re staying in to flatten the pandemic&#8217;s massive curve.</p>



<p>One of the aspects: coming face to face with each other’s cleaning habits. There are different species of the human race when it comes to cleaning. There are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-roomate-is-a-slob/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the slobs</a>, the indifferent ones, the &#8216;wish I were cleaner, but I don’t want to do anything about it&#8217; ones, the excessively paranoid ones, and the ones who do it once in a while as a form of therapy.</p>



<p>If your roomi is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/style/ocd-coronavirus-challenges.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">diagnosed or shows signs of OCD</a>, you should be gentle and mindful about their condition.</p>



<p>But if they don’t, and are suddenly bent on endlessly performing house cleaning during quarantine, then there are some things you could do:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cleaning during quarantine isn&#8217;t bad. Figure why it&#8217;s annoying you and talk to them about it.</h2>



<p>Feels simple, doesn’t it? We all know it isn’t. But if their ways of cleaning during quarantine are acting as an obstacle to your peaceful dwelling at home, you need to talk about it instead of sweeping it under the rug.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t like confrontations, you could look at their display picture in the eyes and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/texts-resolve-common-roommate-conflicts/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">text them your issues to sort them out.</a></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find a middle ground between both your cleaning habits.</h2>



<p>If you’re bothered by their cleaning habits, there&#8217;s a possibility they might be bothered by yours. Try and meet at the clean middle ground. Even if you like a messy room to yourself, clean up after you use the shared spaces in your house. Keep the kitchen, pantry, bathroom, and living area tidy. If they still don’t loosen up when it comes to cleaning, it’s on them. At least you did your bit.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Their cleaning during quarantine could be a coping mechanism, let them have it.</h2>



<p>If your room is a mess and you like it that way (despite the worried stares from the squeaky clean roomi), it&#8217;s best to keep your mess out of their sight. Shut your door when you come out of your room, or hide your mess like you would from your mom.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Respect their cleaning habits!</h2>



<p>You know how you can&#8217;t help <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/best-netflix-shows-series-to-watch-in-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">binge-watching on Netflix </a>for hours on end as a coping mechanism; similarly, your roomi could <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/coronavirus-stress-cleaning-organizing_l_5e792b57c5b6f5b7c5498ecb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be cleaning during quarantine as a coping mechanism too</a>. While both of these are good in moderation, you should check yourself and the people around you if it becomes an excessive habit. Tell the other that it’s all going to be okay, and they don’t need to indulge in unhealthy habits to avoid reality.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Divide your quarantine cleaning among all roommates!</h2>



<p>This might sound like work, but it will make your life easier for them and you. Take the initiative, make a list, and share it with your roomis. The advantage of taking the initiative? You get to choose what you like and leave the rest for them! Your cleaning-obsessed roomis will be happy that you took the effort and might even thank you for leaving the dirty bits for them!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Try avoiding a fight. No one should be fighting over cleaning during quarantine.</h2>



<p>If you’re laidback and don’t care much about how your home looks when no one’s visiting, try being laidback about their preferences as well. Don’t pick a fight or let it go, even if they start it. Invite them to hang out with some beer or wine and let them pour their grievances all out.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find some inspiration in their cleaning habits.</h2>



<p>If you’ve been thinking of cleaning up for a while now, without ever getting to it, take inspiration from your cleaning-obsessed roomi and give it a try. It will help you judge them less for their cleaning habits, and who knows, you might get obsessed too!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whether you’re a neat freak or just someone who wants to live without germs in your apartment, dividing cleaning responsibilities between housemates can get even messier than your not-so-neat apartment. Which is why you should&nbsp;be on the same page&nbsp;with any new housemates. (Let’s face it: No one wins in the&nbsp;garbage stalemate.)&nbsp;But research may give you an incentive to create a regimen that you’ll all want to stick to.&nbsp;So let&#8217;s get to how you can get rid of hidden germs in your apartment. </p>



<p>Researchers at the University of Arizona recently found that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.livescience.com/12876-guys-apartments-dirtier.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">seven out of 10 coffee tables</a>&nbsp;in guys’ apartments were loaded with bacteria found in animal feces. And don’t get too smug, ladies! About 30 percent of doorknobs in women’s apartments were found to have the very same bacteria. </p>



<p>City apartments are also notorious for dust, dirt and allergens. So, while you might be tempted to look the other way, it’s in everyone’s best interest to clean up your act for good.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Get an area rug for your wooden floors</h2>



<p>To you and your roommates, hardwood flooring is probably a well-valued amenity in a rental. Not only does it look nicer and more well-kempt, but it’s also probably easier to clean, right?&nbsp;Eh…not really. That&#8217;s where all the hidden germs in your apartment live. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“It’s a common misconception that bare floors are cleaner than carpets,” says Jotham Hatch, Director of Training at&nbsp;Chem-Dry, the leading upholstery and carpet cleaner as ranked by Entrepreneur Magazine.“The fact is that dust, dirt and germs in your apartment settle on hard surfaces.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Invest in a vacuum for hidden germs in your apartment</h2>



<p>So, once you have the area rug, you have to make sure you’re keeping it clean. Sure, this is an added expense. But vacuum cleaners are also really versatile to help clean the hidden germs in your apartment in the upholstery and fabrics. And as you might’ve guessed by now, there are a lot of them.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“There can be over 100,000 dust mites in just 10 square feet of carpet, and an area rug can store one-third of its weight in hidden germs in your apartment and allergens,” says Hatch.</p></blockquote>



<p>And while it might be tempting to stop by your local convenience store for the cheapest, most readily available brand,&nbsp;it’s worth spending a little more for the right model.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“A vacuum with a HEPA filter traps hidden germs in your apartment and airborne allergens that normal filters can’t catch,” says Hatch.</p></blockquote>



<p>For your best chance of eliminating surface build-up, vacuum carpets and upholstery (like couch covers and curtains) at least once a week.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Pick up after pets </h2>



<p>No, we’re not just talking about the toys they’ve buried around the apartment or the accidents that happen every “once in a blue moon.” Your pet might be your&nbsp;live-in bestie. But Fido’s dander can cause serious allergies for you and your roommates. Especially if either of you is prone to asthma.</p>



<p>One obvious tip is to keep pets off carpets, furniture and beds. But we all know that’s easier said than done. (Because who else are you going to cuddle with after coming home from a third bad date in a row?) So instead of kicking off your furry friend to sleep on the floor, get out the bubbles to tackle the germs in your apartment. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Bathing your cat or dog regularly goes a long way in reducing the amount of dead skin cells and hair on your surfaces,” says Hatch.</p></blockquote>



<p>In fact, one study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that bathing dogs reduced their allergen levels by as much as 85 percent. But those levels returned to normal in about three days. Your fur-baby may not like getting a scrubbing that often, but your roommates (and your respiratory system) will thank you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Get at the&nbsp;grout for germs in your apartment</h2>

Even so, keeping these surfaces clean requires some elbow grease.</p>

<p>It’s best to use a household cleaner that’s low in volatile organic compounds (VOC.) As&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/volatile-organic-compounds/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">one recent study</a>&nbsp;found that they may worsen allergies and asthma.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“When using cleaning solutions on your own, scrub these areas with a sponge, cloth or non-metallic brush to avoid scratching or damaging the surface,” recommends Hatch. “For a deeper and healthier cleaning for hidden germs in your apartment, contact a professional tile and grout cleaning service that will use a thorough cleaning process including a protectant sealer.”</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Sanitize germy hotspots</h2>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.newsmax.com/Health/Health-News/infections-hand-fist-bump/2014/01/09/id/546258/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">80 percent</a>&nbsp;of all infections are transmitted by hands. &nbsp;This also depends on how many people you live with. Or the amount of traffic going in and out of your apartment.</p>



<p>Some of the most plausible areas for germs in your apartment include doorknobs, toilet handles and light switches. So when hosting guests for the holidays or a weekend stay,&nbsp;store a bottle of hand sanitizer nearby.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Keep a cleaning calendar</h2>



<p>This isn’t just for daily routines, but also for scheduling professional cleaning services and maintenance. Even if it’s only a few times a year. You can print a&nbsp;<a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/2c/3e/ca/2c3eca04e2339cb0dd77a8c0a9b8021a.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cleaning chart</a>&nbsp;online that’ll make it easy for everyone to stick to. It’s best to divide and conquer. So each roommate takes one area of the apartment each week to tidy up to tackle germs in your apartment. And remember that even though your room is your private space, it has germs that will carry themselves to other areas of your apartment. So make it a habit to keep it clean.</p>
