<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Go skating or sledding at Boston Common</h2>



<p>No matter what the season, Boston Common is a popular hotspot for Bostonians!</p>



<p>The Boston Common is a wonderful park to visit in both the summer and winter months. It’s also home to the beloved Frog Pond, where in the warmer months, you&#8217;ll find the infamous swan boat rides. In the cooler winter months, the pond transforms into a magical ice rink! The Frog Pond offers skate rentals, so don’t worry if you don’t own a pair of ice skates!</p>



<p>After a fun-filled day of ice skating and sledding, head over to The Frog Pond Cafe for a steaming hot chocolate and a delicious meal. What more could you ask for on a winter&#8217;s day!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take a walk on the Freedom Trail</h2>



<p>Looking for some history and a good workout? Head over to the Freedom Trail! The Freedom Trail is one of Boston’s most historic sites and is a must-see for any tourist. The trail is only 2.5 miles, so it’s not too strenuous either!</p>



<p>Along the Freedom Trail, you’ll spot historic landmarks including the Massachusetts State House and the Old South Meeting House. After your stroll, head over to Faneuil Hall for shopping at the market&#8230; the perfect day!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Visit the Boston Holiday Market</h2>



<p>It truly is the most wonderful time of year at the Boston Holiday Market!</p>



<p>Located at the City Plaza Government Center, the Boston Holiday Market is a fan favorite. The Boston Holiday Market is one of the many popular markets across the city that pop up during the holidays. There’s plenty to do, including browsing handmade gifts and sampling a range of delicious food. After a day at the holiday markets you&#8217;re sure to come away thinking that <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/7-winter-traditions-from-around-the-world-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">winter is the best season!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Snowshoe at Gore Place</h2>



<p>Looking for more outdoor winter fun? Consider going snowshoeing at Gore Place! Gore Place is located just outside of Boston and is about a 13-minute drive. Spanning across 50 acres, there’s plenty of room for snowshoeing!</p>



<p>No snowshoes? No problem! Gore Place offers snowshoe rentals at the Carriage House for a small price. Grab a few close friends and head over for a snow-filled day of fun!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. A themed family games night</h2>



<p>The holiday season is a perfect occasion to cozy up, relax and have fun! If you find yourself searching for something more to do, why not organise a games night? We suggest you stick to holiday-themed games such as Christmas trivia, to keep things appropriately festive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Virtual wine tasting</h2>



<p>A Zoom wine tasting event is a great way to discover new wines with friends while pretending you’re at a gorgeous vineyard in Napa (instead of the same house you’ve been in for eight months!). A little festive escapism is just what we need in 2020, right?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. A holiday playlist</h2>



<p>Nothing gets us into the spirit quite like holiday music. Curate a memorable playlist by asking your family and friends to add their all-time favorite holiday song to the list. Pour yourself a wine and have a singalong!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. <strong>Get crafty with &#8216;Thank You&#8217; cards</strong></h2>



<p>A great Christmas Day activity is to get crafty! Pull out some scrapbooking supplies and sit down for an art project and an opportunity to express gratitude to the ones you love &#8211; and yourself!</p>

<p>The holidays are going to look a bit different this year, but that doesn’t mean we have to miss out on some of the season’s most festive activities.

<p>In fact, this year is a great opportunity to create new holiday traditions that are fun, safe and memorable.</p>
