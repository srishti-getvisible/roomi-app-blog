<p>Are you still dating your documents with 2021? Well, this is just an official reminder that 2022 is here, and you need to get out of the 2021 loop and move forward with the new year.</p>



<p>Many things have changed from last year (even though some have not). The decor trends last year were more about neutral shades and minimalism.</p>



<p>This year is quite different. From bold colors to natural textures- there is no dearth of house design trends to embrace. If you are not sure where to start, we have a comprehensive list of 2022 decor trends to get you started.</p>



<p>And guess what? These decor hacks are perfect for renters as well.</p>



<p>Let’s admit it, we don’t want to live with the same decor trends year after year, but we also do not want to get into trouble with our landlord. So, go ahead and personalize your rented house without the fear of breaking the terms of your lease. Another plus, these ideas do not require half of your salary or hours to implement.</p>

<p>With work from home becoming the general norm, we are spending more time indoors than we could have imagined. It is no surprise that we want to ensure our connection with nature by bringing the outdoors inside and using nature-inspired decor trends.</p>



<p>Experiment with natural surfaces like wooden boards, grass mats, etc. Style up your small space with planters, and vases, and bring more greenery to your space.</p>

<p>Removable wallpapers are an affordable way to play around and add a new vibe to your house. Painting your rented house is not a landlord-friendly hack and may result in a fee upon move-outing.</p>



<p>So, go the easy way by using removable wallpapers and personalize your space without making any permanent changes.</p>



<p>And ohh don’t worry, wallpapers are not going out of style, at least not anytime soon. Choose from colors and prints that reflect your personality, and create a gorgeous looking apartment.</p>

<p>Changing the window coverings is an easy way to add a little spark to your rented apartment. Ditch the boring vertical blinds and switch to colors, prints, and patterns for your window coverings.</p>



<p>Style your drapes in a quirky way can make a big difference in how your space feels. Plus, you can take your new curtains with you when you move to another place. <a href="https://roomiapp.com/"><strong>Find your dream house now.</strong></a></p>

<p>One way to transform your space is by changing the lighting in your apartment. You can switch out the light bulbs, and install color-changing LED light bulbs that will allow you to change the color of the lights, and the mood of your apartment, whenever you want..</p>



<p>You can vary the amount of light by adding floor lamps and table lamps throughout your apartment. For more overhead or wall light, you can add temporary stick-on battery-powered LED light fixtures. For more subtle light, you can add some twinkling fairy lights.</p>

<p>One of the key things for small space decor is to keep your house pleasant and appealing. Organize your house, keep it clean and curate a thoughtful place setting for an attractive look.</p>



<p>For example, you can add some fresh flowers to your dining room table. Or you can add a table cloth and napkins to create a cozier dinning area.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting started</h2>



<p>Before you step out and spend those precious dollars, here are a few things to keep in mind. You will need to shell out some cash to decorate your off-campus housing. Hence, be sure that what you buy is going to fit your student apartment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="12924" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/decorate-off-campus-housing-on-a-budget/attachment/home-decor-couch-cushion/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2560,1707" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="home-decor-couch-cushion" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="a grey couch with blue cushions" class="wp-image-12924" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?resize=1568%2C1045&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/home-decor-couch-cushion-scaled.jpeg?w=2500&amp;ssl=1 2500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Budget</h3>



<p>It can be easy to get carried away while decorating your off campus housing. Dorms and campus housing may have restrictions when it comes to decoration or modifications. However, off campus housing is a lot more flexible. Be sure that you set a budget and do not spend on unnecessary items or furniture. Remember you can always buy something later if you still feel that you really want it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Available space</h3>



<p>Do you really need that 50 inch T.V. or that huge fluffy rug? Don&#8217;t get carried away when you shop. And be realistic. Make sure what you buy will actually fit in your off campus housing, and is practical. There is still a lot you can do if you are working with a small space. However, be sure you don&#8217;t overdo it and end up with a cluttered apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pets</h3>



<p>Having a pet is a commitment that you need to take seriously. Thus, be sure that you have your furry friend in mind while decorating and furnishing your off campus housing. Make sure that you are creating an environment that is safe and comfortable for your pet. Also, keep in mind that you need a place for your pet to sleep and relieve themselves! Shedding can also be something that you need to plan for, to avoid a mess. Fragile decorations on open shelves can also be a disaster. Ask yourself if the things you are buying are going to be a problem.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Aesthetic</h3>



<p>It is easy to see something pretty and spring for it in the spur of the moment. However, do consider if what you are buying will actually fit your aesthetic and that of your off campus housing. The last thing that you want, is to buy something and then realize that you really don&#8217;t like it that much. Hence, be sure to set the vibe you want to go for!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Practicality and mindfulness</h3>



<p>While you may really think that fancy ceramic shot glass set will really up your house party game, hold on. When you&#8217;re on a budget, be careful of your temptation to spring for fancier and more pricey versions of things. Don&#8217;t fall for marketing and end up going beyond your means! However, this doesn&#8217;t mean you should always buy cheaper and low-quality items. Being mindful is the key here. Before buying something, ask yourself. Is this going to add value to me or my space?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buying furniture</h2>



<p>If you are moving into an unfurnished off campus housing, then the first thing you&#8217;ll need to buy is furniture. Get started with a list of things you will need to furnish your off campus apartment. Make sure that you are getting everything and not less, and definitely not more. Again, remember, that mahogany shelf may look great in the corner, but do you really need it?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to get?</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s start off with the essentials. You will need a bed and mattress to start off. A solid and comfortable study desk and chair is also a good investment. Beyond this, it really depends on the size and nature of your off campus housing. If you are living in a studio apartment, you may want to keep it limited and only get a small couch or coffee table. However, if you are moving into a bigger space and sharing it, you may want to get a larger couch and table for your common spaces.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where to get it?</h3>



<p>For furniture, you may want to check out <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">IKEA</a>. This basically your one-stop shop for all your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/affordable-furniture-shops-when-living-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">furniture needs</a>! Other than this, you can visit local stores and look for deals as well. Buying used furniture online is also a great option. You can often find great deals on used furniture that can save you a decent buck. Remember, these are things that you will use regularly and need to last you a while. Hence, take your time and do your share of window shopping.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Buying applicances and decoration</h2>



<p>After you&#8217;ve got yourself the essentials with a full set of furniture, appliances and accessories are next. This is the place where you should exercise your fair share of caution. It can be easy to splurge too much on these items. Be sure you are getting what you need, and that it adds value to your space and life.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to get?</h3>



<p>Again, this can widely vary depending on your lifestyle and the size of your off campus housing. If you are going to be cooking at home, a fridge and stove are going to be essential. Beyond this, you can get a microwave, blender or oven depending on the kind of cooking you do. If you are going to be eating out or in your college mess, you may want to skip this all. Ask yourself if you need a television and if you and your flat mates are actually going to using it. When it comes to decoration, keep all the earlier tips in mind, and consult with your roommates if you have any.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where to get it?</h3>



<p>You can look to <a href="https://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart</a> or <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/?intl=nosplash" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Bestbuy</a> to find appliances and other decorations. They usually have a large selection and decent prices. You can also look to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a> and easily find great deals online as well. Try <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Etsy</a> for handmade and more personalized decor and art. Again, be sure to check with local stores for deals.</p>

<p>No one can prepare you for the feeling of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/a-foolproof-guide-to-adopting-a-dog-with-your-roomi-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopting</a> your first pet. It’s a magical moment! The moment you realize there’s no one else who will love you as unconditionally as your pet will. It’s one of the purest bonds to exist and in our opinion, everyone should experience it at least once! But a pet also means you’ll have to make several changes to your lifestyle. So, today we thought we’d discuss one such major change that you’ll have to make for the new pet in your life. But don’t worry, it’s the fun kinda change where you get to go shopping! Yes, we’re talking about making the decor of your Los Angeles apartment <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/apartment-hacks-to-make-your-apartment-dog-friendly-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pet friendly</a>. Doesn’t matter if it’s a quintessential tiny Los Angeles apartment or one of those rare big apartments, there is a pet-friendly apartment hack in here for you! So, let’s begin!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get good quality pet gates to make your Los Angeles apartment pet friendly</h2>



<p>Yes, we know, pet gates aren’t known to be the most beautiful addition to your decor, especially if it’s a small apartment. But trust us, you’re going to need it. Because as much as you adore your pet, sometimes giving them full access to your house can cause trouble. But you don’t have to buy pet gates that are ugly and ruin your vibe. There’s plenty of great (re: beautiful) options out there! For example, check out <a href="https://petprojectla.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Pet Project LA</a> for some really cool stuff to make your Los Angeles apartment pet friendly without compromising on your aesthetic. Try to look for gates that match the color scheme of your home, so that they become a part of your decor (now, that’s a good apartment hack!). Who said pet friendly apartments have to be an eye-sore!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A designated feeding station to make your Los Angeles apartment pet friendly</h2>



<p>Now, this is the part where you get to be creative! A feeding station is obviously a necessary part of owning a pet. But most people don’t give it much thought and that’s such a mistake! This is a great opportunity to really make your Los Angeles Apartment pet friendly <em>and</em> beautiful! I mean, just look at this kitchen island with the in-built dog dishes!</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/68736134221/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/68736134221/</a>



<p>Of course, this is an example of one of those fancy pet-friendly apartments. But that doesn’t mean you can’t have fun with the decor of your small apartment! The only apartment hack here is that there is no hack! Go as wild as you want! (Or as basic as you want, no judgement!).</p>

Here is a Foolproof Guide!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Make use of the mudroom</strong></h2>



<p>Very few apartments have features that are pet friendly by default but a mudroom is one of them. If you happen to live in an apartment in Los Angeles that has a mudroom, then your home is already pet friendly! You just need to make some modifications! Set up a little clean-up station in your mudroom and call it a day. But if you happen to live in a small apartment that doesn’t have a mudroom, don’t worry, we’ve got decor solutions for you too! Just make some space near your door that will act as a clean up station. But remember any furniture you put around there should be stain-resistant! Another great apartment hack is to tile the area so that it’s easier to clean up the splatters! Here’s a gorgeous example of a DIY mudroom!</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/140806228626747/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/140806228626747/</a>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Furniture, fabric and fashion!</h2>



<p>So, as you might already know, having pets can be quite stressful for your belongings… Of course you’ll train your pets and they’ll learn how to behave in-doors, but accidents will happen. Quite frequently. Making the decor of your small Los Angeles apartment pet friendly is actually not that difficult. It’s just about being careful about what you buy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So, what do you do?</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Well, for starters, invest in fabric that is stain-resistant. That means all your furniture, curtains, table cloths will have to be made from material that can sustain <em>accidents</em>. That’s what pet friendly apartments are all about.</li><li>We actually have a fantastic apartment hack for you here: try and pick a color scheme that matches your pet&#8217;s fur. That way, when they shed, it won’t be so obvious on your furniture.</li><li>Avoid furniture that your pet can chew on. Instead go for metal or leather.</li><li>Invest in <a href="https://www.residentialproductsonline.com/most-stain-resistant-washable-matte-paint-market" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">washable paint</a>, <em>trust us on this</em>.</li><li>A colorful <a href="https://www.woven.is/">rug</a> will hide many secrets and accidents.</li><li>Since most household plants are <a href="https://www.ccspca.com/blog-spca/education/poisonous-plants-for-dogs/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">poisonous</a> for dogs, don’t keep those on ground level.</li></ul>

	</div>
	


<p>In the end, making your home decor more pet friendly is a way to show to your pet that they’re a part of your family. So, take a deep breath and do what feels right for you and your pet. You’ve got this!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-have-a-wide-empty-floor-area-floor-plants-are-the-answer">Have a wide, empty floor area? Floor plants are the answer!</h2>



<p>So you don’t know what to do with the empty space in a room? Invest in a floor plant! Floor plants are an awesome addition to a room that’s a bit spacious, such as a living room. Plus, floor plants are a much cheaper alternative for filling an empty space as opposed to purchasing another piece of furniture.</p>



<p>Where on the floor does your pot go? Make sure your plant is placed near a window and has enough light. In addition, make sure that your floor plant’s dimensions make sense for the room that it’ll be in. Floor plants are bound to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/cheap-life-hacks-to-turn-your-new-apartment-into-a-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make any room feel a bit homier!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-don-t-have-a-green-thumb-invest-in-succulents-and-cacti">Don&#8217;t have a green thumb? Invest in succulents and cacti!</h2>



<p>Succulents and cacti are popular flora for those who don’t exactly have a green thumb. These plants have also become a sought-after decor trend. Invest in cute potted succulents or cacti if you want a pop of life on your desk or counter! Whether you&#8217;re limited on space or just love a vibrant display, creating a versatile setup with various plants can instantly transform your space. Consider checking out some of the popular <a href="https://www.bloomsybox.com/plants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potted plants collection</a> which offers an array of choices perfect for brightening any living area. This option provides convenience and allows you to select the ideal indoor plant that suits your taste and maintenance capabilities.</p>



<p></p>



<p>These plants are hearty and well-suited for areas in which other plants wouldn&#8217;t thrive. Succulents and cacti need little water and sunlight, so they are a great alternative for those who want a real plant but don’t have the time to take care of one. Succulents and cacti can thrive anywhere, so there is no need to worry about finding the perfect spot for them!</p>

<p>Have a large, empty wall space in your small apartment that you don’t know what to do with? Make a wall of hanging plants! Wall plants are becoming a popular trend among plant lovers.</p>



<p>Pick your favorite wall plant or herb and put them in a small pot. Use a few wood screws to hold your plants into the wall and there you go!</p>



<p>If you’re someone who has a love for carpentry, you could even build shelves for your wall foliage. A great DIY project!</p>

<p>Add a pop of color to any room with an artificial plant of your choice. Fake plants are also a great option for people who want a plant aesthetic but have a small apartment that doesn&#8217;t offer enough natural light.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living in the midst of beautiful art is bound to put you in a better frame of mind and make your day a lot better. To decorate your shared apartment, one needs a lot of brainstorming. After the year we’ve had, we could all use some pleasant changes, right? Now we know what you’re thinking &#8211; do you have any idea what that costs? Bear with us- we can give you 4 home decor ideas for a shared apartment even on a budget.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>The ability to make somebody feel something: that&#8217;s art. However you look at it, whether you&#8217;re an author, a painter, a singer, a rapper, a spoken-word artist &#8211; art.</p><cite>Wale</cite></blockquote>



<p>Let’s start with the whole notion of art itself. It’s not just Picassos and Jackson Pollocks. As Wale so expertly explains above, art makes you feel something. So it’s not restricted to a framed piece or even something that’s bought. Look within to find something that stirs your soul. The golden light of sunset? Sunflowers that remind you of home? A photograph of your dear ones? A cherished letter? Then you find something that channels that feeling. Here are a few ideas to get you going:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Neon signage</h2>

<p>One of the best things about signage is that it can say anything you want it to. It can be an inside joke that makes you smile every time you see it. Or it can remind you of your favorite bar back home or be reaffirming. It also doesn’t have to break the bank as it can be a weekend DIY project!</p>



<p>We love LED signage because it channels an edgy, New York City vibe home decor. Choose from chalkboard signage, 3-D paper lettering, or marquee signage.</p>

<p>As we look back on our lives, memories stand out. Family gatherings in your backyard or days out with your friends. What could be more soulful than a gallery of the significant moments in your life?</p>



<p>You can choose uniform frames to hold the pawprints of that furry friend who stole your heart, a pressed flower from your garden at home, or movie stubs from the day out with your friends. It could be anything as long as it really makes you feel something. Frame it so you can remind yourself of the good times.</p>

<p>This idea is great for the public spots within shared apartments, especially for making them picture-perfect. Create ‘corners’ of art with a variety of textures, colors, and home decor pieces.</p>



<p>Roommates can merge elements that are personally meaningful to them. Think pops of color, artistically positioned mirrors, or flowers. This is a collaborative process to help you learn more about your roommates and bring you closer together.</p>

<p>Isn’t art trying to recreate nature after all? Why have a painting of a sunflower when you can have the sunflower itself blooming in your living room?</p>

Imagine being able to feast your eyes on a truly green space whenever you want. Using plants in home decor is a trend that we’re happy to get behind!</p>



<p>Whether you purchase art worth thousands of dollars or frame a drawing made by your little niece- you’re looking for pieces that move you. We recommend decorating shared apartments with pieces that aim to uplift those who live in them.</p>



<p>Just like art does.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you share an apartment with someone, you don’t always agree on everything. Maybe you like minimalist decor, while they’re a hoarder. Differences in home decor preferences can be really annoying. But coliving means you have to accept your differences and try to find common ground. But that doesn’t mean you have to be unhappy with your apartment. Changing up your home decor can be great for your mental health.</p>



<p>But in order to revamp your home decor, you need to declutter first. I’m sure you’ve seen enough Marie Kondo videos to know what I’m talking about. So how do you do it? How do you declutter when you share an apartment with someone? You can’t just get up one day and throw away half the stuff in your house because you want to take your home decor to the next level. You and your roommate need to be in this together- that’s what coliving is about.</p>



<p>This is why today, we’re going to show you how to declutter when you share an apartment with another person!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Share an apartment, Share the burden</h2>



<p>When you’re coliving with someone, you need to divide up chores evenly, it’s only fair. You can’t share an apartment with someone and not do any of the work (and vice versa). So if you’re dividing up everything else, then why should decluttering be only one’s person’s job? Get your roommate with you one weekend and just start sorting through all your stuff.</p>



<p>Decluttering can be really difficult for some people, so having another person to do it with is actually a great idea. Pick one day where you declutter your part of the house and another day for your roommates. You can sort through your common items one afternoon, it probably won’t take a lot of time. Let your roommate know that if they want a cute new home decor, they need to get rid of the old stuff!</p>

<p><strong>Roomi advice: We know you&#8217;re probably very enthusiastic about decluttering your home. But be careful when you’re dealing with your roommate’s stuff. Some people have a very strong emotional connection to the stuff they own. Don’t force them to throw out anything that they hold near their heart!</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/when-to-get-rid-of-clutter-2647992" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here’s a helpful guide</a> to help you decide what stuff to keep and what to throw away.</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on what you have in common</h2>



<p>When you’re deciding on what to keep and what to throw away with your roommates, make sure you keep in mind what you two have in common aesthetically. If you have a hot pink lamp that they hate, throw it away. Similarly, if they have a painting you hate, ask them to get rid of it. That’s just how it works when you share an apartment with another person. At the end of this process, you will start to see what your shared aesthetic really is. This step is really important to figure out what your home decor is going to look like. Coliving tends to bring out some eccentric home styles and we’re here for it!</p>



<p><strong>Roomi Advice: Set a number of things that you both will need to give up- nothing more and nothing less. This way, no one will feel like they’re being forced to get rid of more stuff than the other person.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stay Decluttered</h2>



<p>Once you’ve gone through the painful process of throwing stuff away, don’t go right back to buying more stuff to fill the empty space! It defeats the whole purpose. Because you share an apartment with them, make sure your roommate is on the same page as you on this one. Make a pact, a coliving pact, if you will. No one buys more than two new things a month. If you and your roommates are avid shoppers, this might be hard for you, but you’ve got this! This is how your home decor will remain coherent and uncluttered!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Maximize your space</h2>



<p>Oh, one of the great joys of home decor- maximizing your existing space! When you share an apartment with someone, your place can fill up so fast that you forget just how much space you actually have. But now that you and your roommate have decluttered, all that space is back. Maybe you can install new shelves or rearrange your living room just to change things up. Get your roommate and strategize about what to do with all this new space! Isn’t coliving so great sometimes?</p>

<p>Decorating with plants has become the quarantine hobby of the year. From seasoned plant moms to novice gardening enthusiasts, home decor is taking an official green turn.</p>



<p>The desire to suddenly acquire green fingers goes beyond the beautiful aesthetics added by plants to home decor. Being stuck in our homes for most of 2020 had us craving the outdoors and fresh air like never before. For many, gardening and decorating with plants has given them much-needed respite within the comfort of their homes.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A common rookie mistake is to perch the plant pots on windowsills or a sunny-seeming corner. <strong>Just like us humans, our plants don’t want to be sunburnt or get winter chills!</strong> It is good to do a quick lighting check in each room of the house.</li><li><strong>Light tip: South-facing windows will allow the brightest natural light, followed by east and west for moderate exposure and north-facing for low light.</strong> The farther away from the window, the less the natural light!</li><li>Your plant might be your home decor shining star, but it might have come all the way from another city in the back of a dusty truck. Give it some time to adjust to its new home!</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Watering basics for the gardening rookie</h2>



<p>Okay, so do we <em>really need</em> to go over watering plants? Plants get thirsty just like us right?</p>



<p><strong>Well, it might be helpful to remember that when decorating with plants, overwatering kills.</strong></p>

</div></figure>



<p>You know that feeling you get when you step into a puddle of water with socks on? Think of that when you water, because even plants don’t like their feet soggy and wet! Look for plant pots with holes. Be sure to dump out excess water from the plant pot after watering and keep a saucer under the pot to allow proper drainage.</p>



<p>If you’re planting succulents or similar species, remember that they need watering only every 7-10 days.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to dress your plant children up in some beautiful, porous ceramic plant pots to upscale the home decor! Hang up the plant pots for an extra edge when decorating with plants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. I’m dead.. I’m alive but I’m dead!: Dormancy phases of gardening</h2>



<p><strong>We’ve all had an “oops, I killed my plant!” moment. It&#8217;s alright— you are not a bad mother if your child looks dead.</strong></p>



<p>Like human beings, plants too go through “dormancy” phases. This can happen within a 24 hour period, and often usually after they fully bloom.</p>



<p>Dormancy phases in gardening can vary based on the plant you have, even when you&#8217;re planting succulents. The plant pots can look dilapidated during summer or winter dormancy. This is a rest phase before the plant blooms full cycle again. Be sure to do a bit of research to ensure decorating with plants stays easy for you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Why you need to DTR (define the relationship) before adding plants to home decor!</h2>



<p>Plants are living, breathing, colorful creatures that are life-affirming to care for. So when you’re flirting with the idea of decorating with plants, you really need to define the relationship you can have with your future plant children.</p>



<p>Are you looking for something casual or committed to a long-term affair? Get real about your work hours and schedule. Gardening and being a plant parent means catering to each of your plants, which may all run on different schedules over the year.</p>

<p>I know we all want a lush, green forest feel in our living rooms, but nobody wants a dead jungle in their house. Do you need to break up with your succulents? Think tactfully through so you can ensure the best experience for both you and your plant babies. I mean, fake plants aren’t THAT bad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the current scenario of the world wanting us to spend most of our time cooped up inside our apartments, one of the few ways to feel better is by giving our homes a makeover every now and then.</p>



<p>And when it comes to redecorating, a blend of our personal style and our intuitive sense for home decor can help us achieve the kind of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/home-environment-and-healthy-living-habits-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">environment we want for our home</a>.</p>



<p>So whether you&#8217;re looking to decorate your newly inhabited NYC apartment, or want a new look for your apartment or room, here&#8217;s something that will help you out!</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve collated some of the best tips and tricks from New York&#8217;s best interior designers to give you the home decor &#8216;aha&#8217; moment you deserve.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Art for your home decor project!</h2>



<p>If your walls feel naked to you, dress them up with the art you love. The good news is you don&#8217;t have to be a collector or a very rich person for adorning your apartment or room with art. With a few simple hacks, you can make your walls look beautiful.</p>



<p><a href="https://thewhitearrow.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">White Arrow</a>&#8216;s Keren Richter shares this viewpoint with <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-designer-favorite-apartments#slide-6">refinery29</a> as he talks about a tiny Nolita apartment that he worked on. He says he was able to transform the apartment and make it feel more spacious on a very small budget.</p>



<p>His modern home decor tip: <strong><em>“Framing and matting art can be wildly expensive, but a cheap way to display imagery is to find frames at thrift stores and paint them black or white. Then make art to fill them or resize images to fit.”</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/943/x/1432861/image.jpg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="modern home decor"/></figure>



<p>Source: <a href="http://refinery29.com">refinery29.com</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Embrace the home decor work in progress</h2>



<p>The fact of the matter is, your apartment will always be a work in progress, just like you. So don&#8217;t be in a hurry to reach your home decor destination! Just enjoy the journey, adding beautiful elements as and when they come your way.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.blairharris.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blair Harris</a> talks about this as she shares how she has been adorning her apartment with textures, art, and objects she&#8217;s collected over the years, and still continues to do so.</p>



<p>Her modern home decor tip: <strong><em>“Collect art and other meaningful decorative objects gradually, and only buy what you love. Our apartment is a constant work in progress, as I’m always adding to a collection of pieces we adore.”</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/ccd/x/1432869/image.jpg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="modern home decor tip"/><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://refinery29.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refinery29.com</a>x</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Good home decor fits in small apartments</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/living-in-nyc-5-common-myths-debunked-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Living in NYC</a>, we all know the troubles of the super small space that we might have to call our home. But a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/roomis-guide-to-studio-apartments-and-small-spaces-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">small space</a> does not have to limit you when it comes to home decor!</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.mydomaine.com/small-space-decorating-tips-4767838" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kimberly Winthrop, designer at Laurel &amp; Wold suggests</a>, use furniture and objects that can serve multiple purposes. This will help create more space and save money when decorating your small NYC apartment.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Her modern home decor tip: <strong><em>"With a little bit of research, you can easily find a host of products that can do double duty in your home. An ottoman, for example, can have hidden storage and be a place to put up your feet. By adding a tray, it can also serve as a coffee table, providing an extra surface to place a drink when hosting friends."</em></strong></pre>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Add some color to your home decor palette</h2>



<p>Color has positive effects on our mood. It can make the dreary winter months feel a bit brighter and the summer months feel more vibrant and cool too. So add lovely hues that suit the season and transform your apartment into the haven that makes you happy.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.younghuh.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Young Huh</a>&#8216;s modern home decor tip: <strong><em>“Fabric curtains immediately add luxurious structure and color to a room.”</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1530186947-b2039611ba08?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=654&amp;q=80" alt="modern home decor tip"/><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Blend masculine and feminine elements in your home decor</h2>



<p>Did you know there are masculine and feminine elements that are characteristic of the furniture and other objects in your home? And it doesn&#8217;t depend on what gender you belong to!</p>



<p><a href="https://www.lovehappensmag.com/blog/2019/03/23/timeless-interiors-laura-umansky/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laura Umansky</a> talks about how your apartment or room can be made interesting and fun just by blending complementing masculine and feminine elements the right way.</p>



<p>She says that the soft, gentle feminine styles contrasted with the sleek and structured masculine tones in your home decor can help captivate all the senses.</p>



<p>Her modern home decor tip: <strong><em>The tension between feminine and masculine styles adds complexity and depth. Mix moody colors with curved chairs. Pair square tables with round mirrors. Combine clean lines with organic, free-form shapes.</em></strong></p>

<p>Being stuck inside our homes in 2020 was a challenging experience for us all. However, the new year brings a wave of home decor creativity as we reinvent our homes to fit our changing lifestyles.</p>



<p>We now look towards new, imaginative living room decor trends to accommodate our transformed lives.</p>



<p>Prior to pandemic life, our living spaces did not anticipate self-isolated dance parties, or long hours of working on our couches. As a result, we are readapting our home and living room decor to match our different needs through the day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">See also: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/work-from-home-essentials-for-the-renting-roomi/2161/">How To Create The Perfect Workspace At (Your Rented) Home</a></h3>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/home/decor/home-design-trends-2021?slide=d83b5873-21f1-47ee-8734-dc52747bbb66#d83b5873-21f1-47ee-8734-dc52747bbb66">Southern Living</a>, in 2021 many are opting for a decorating style that is the equivalent of “athleisure” aka comfy and chic.</p>



<p>Our disconnect from nature while stuck indoors has created a craving for an earthy feel. Decorating with plants has made a strong comeback to home decor. ****</p>



<p><strong>Altogether, 2021 screams PERSONALITY through large wall art, bold living room decor, and an inclination towards a certain “Grandmillenial” style.</strong></p>



<p>Want to jump on the “new year, new me” bandwagon? Roomi is here to provide you with a mood board with fresh ideas to liven up your current living room decor— guided by interior design experts and good old Pinterest.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. “Grandmillenial home decor”</h2>



<p>Uncertain times are urging a certain sense of nostalgia and need for stability in our homes. Nicknamed “granny chic”, this trend creates space for bold, highly-detailed design or floral wallpaper into home decor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Neon bedroom wall art</h2>



<p>We can blame Gen Z for bringing back Neon bedroom wall art. Tiktok dances have created the need for snazzy backgrounds that include large wall art or neon-colored lighting to add that 80s retro feel.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/decorating/home-decor-trends-2021">Pinterest</a> searches for &#8220;neon room&#8221; have increased eight times, while the search for &#8220;LED light signs&#8221; has increased three times. The statistics don’t lie, and soft, glowy bedroom wall art is certainly all the rage in 2021.</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>A Tire (new or used one)</li><li>Two Pieces of MDF boards 1/4 inch thick (size depends on the size of your tire). If finding this is a little difficult, try stuffing the tire&#8217;s cavity with sturdy cushioning and use layers of sturdy cardboard circles glued together instead of MDF.</li><li>Jigsaw (for cutting MDF in a circle).

<p><em>Process</em>&nbsp;&#8211; This DIY craft uses up old tires to create gorgeous seating for your bedroom and living room. Who knew DIY hacks for home decor could be this easy?! The original approach to creating this seating requires you to get MDF boards, but our team believes you can replace it with thick, sturdy cardboard. The trick is to fill the tire&#8217;s cavity with cushioning (the mattress sort which is hard and doesn&#8217;t compress so easily) and then gluing at least 6-7 thick cardboard circles the same diameter as the tire.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.handymantips.org/diy-tire-chair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more about this and the correct way of wrapping the rope around the tire</a>. Trust us, this is one of the most amazing DIY hacks out there!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Plastic Bottle Planters</h3>



<p><em>For this DIY, you will need:</em></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Plastic bottle &#8211; soda/water bottles</li><li>Jute thread</li><li>Scissors</li><li>White spray paint</li><li>White glue</li></ol>

<p><em>Process:</em> This one of the most straight forward and cool DIY hacks. So, cut the bottom half of the bottle carefully with scissors and use a hot iron to flatten the sharp edges. Let the cap on the bottle stay attached for this project. Now, use the spray paint on the bottle and keep it to dry for a few hours. After the paint dries, use white glue to wrap the jute thread around the bottle. Don&#8217;t use a glue gun, as some plastic bottles wilt under hot glue.</p>
