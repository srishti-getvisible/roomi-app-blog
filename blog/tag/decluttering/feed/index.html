<p>We are constantly growing, and this ever-changing nature of our lives is something we need to make peace with. But sometimes, this idea of growing extends to our physical spaces as well. (With the amount of objects ever increasing around us.) And when it gets too cluttered, we all feel the clutter in our head too! But don&#8217;t you worry. The newest sensation to help us out is Marie Kondo. And we&#8217;ve put some of her decluttering tips to good use. So if you&#8217;re in need of some apartment therapy, let&#8217;s declutter with konmari!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is decluttering?</h2>



<p>Decluttering is a way of apartment therapy. It&#8217;s all about getting rid of what is no longer valuable to us. If you&#8217;re looking to declutter with konmari, pick up <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318578-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Life-Changing Magic Of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo</a></strong>. It&#8217;s a book that goes beyond decluttering to simplify your life. <strong>It&#8217;s about doing more with less.</strong></p>



<p>Additionally, you can apply decluttering tips by Marie Kondo to productivity, relationships, your social life, and money management. Her method suggests that you hold the item in your hands and ask yourself &#8211; “Does this item bring me joy?” If it does, hold onto it! But if it doesn&#8217;t, then it is time to let go.</p>



<p>Now, we know that taking the first step is usually the hardest. And it can often seem like a herculean task. But worry not for we’ve got you covered for a head start to declutter with konmari! </p>



<p>Here are some decluttering tips inspired by Marie Kondo!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Ask yourself the right questions, says Marie Kondo</h2>



<p>The Marie Kondo process can be a bit overwhelming. And it looks very different for each individual. But the trick is to come up with decluttering tips in accordance with your lifestyle, habits, and your score on the Lazy-o-meter.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some questions you should ask yourself when dealing with clutter</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Should I keep this? Does this bring me joy?</li><li>If not, do I have to throw this away?</li><li>Or can I donate or sell this instead?</li></ul>

<p>If after asking yourself all of the set questions, you still remain unsure about a few particular items, it&#8217;s advisable to put them in a storage bag or box and leave them out of your sight for a set amount of time. And if you don&#8217;t feel the need for them for a while after that, then that is probably a good indication that you don&#8217;t really need them. And as Marie Kondo says, you have to face these feelings, however difficult it might seem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;The process of facing and selecting our possessions can be quite painful. It forces us to confront our imperfections and inadequacies and the foolish choices we made in the past.&#8221;</p><cite>Marie Kondo</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Give every item a home, in your home</h2>



<p>Having a specific space for items will not only make you aware of the items you use and have but also help you declutter with konmari and stay that way. From using bins and sandwich bags to store electronics or a kitchen utensil organizer for your bathroom drawers to rearrange toiletries, the possibilities are endless!</p>

<p>But Marie Kondo wants you to remember not to go overboard thinking hoarding stuff in nice little boxes <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-tips-to-declutter-if-youre-a-hoarder-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">makes you less of a hoarder</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Storage experts are hoarders.&#8221;</p><cite>Marie Kondo</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The process can be spiritual self assessment too, says Marie Kondo!</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s one of the best decluttering tips you can get &#8211; Take it one weekend at a time, one room at a time, or one drawer at a time.</p>



<p>And if you don&#8217;t have the time or the patience to set aside 10 minutes every day, set aside time once a quarter for a power session for an hour or two with your favorite music playing in the background. This form of apartment therapy is therapeutic even for you! And once you&#8217;ll get on a roll you&#8217;ll be shocked at how much you can get done!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;The process of assessing how you feel about the things you own, identifying those that have fulfilled their purpose, expressing your gratitude, and bidding them farewell, is really about examining your inner self, a rite of passage to a new life.&#8221;</p><cite>Marie Kondo</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are there any benefits to decluttering, apart from a tidy space?</h2>



<p>A cluttered space has the potential to wreak havoc on our minds. Our brains are already overloaded with way too much information, and living in a cluttered home might further impact the stress levels, productivity and make household tasks more challenging.</p>



<p>Making use of quarantine and decluttering, even bit by bit, will lessen your stress and anxiety levels, rid the home of potential allergens, and is a great way to rediscover all those ‘lost’ items you’d given up looking for! So go ahead and declutter with konmari to keep your sanity intact.</p>
