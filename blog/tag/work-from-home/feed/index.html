										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Looks like work from home is here to stay. And no one is complaining! We all are adjusting and adapting to the new normal. Which involves looking for online jobs, whether you want to leave a toxic work place behind, or just want to switch your job. Or maybe you&#8217;re fresh out of college and want to enter the professional world. Nonetheless, we&#8217;re all somewhere on the same field. And we&#8217;re looking for legitimate stay at home jobs that pay well and allow us some peace of mind too.  So here&#8217;s a detailed guide on how to find legitimate stay at home jobs. Along with some companies that help look for the right job, such as <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">we work remotely.</a></p>



<p>Now that most of the population is desperately looking for legitimate online jobs to sustain themselves amidst a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic</a>, unfortunately, scammers have a new market to explore. So when you&#8217;re looking for stay at home jobs online, you need to be extra cautious and take certain measures to protect yourself and your career.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Things to keep in mind for stay at home jobs and offers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Email address</h3>



<p>When a legitimate employer contacts you, they&#8217;ll do so with a legitimate company ID, (<strong>x@companyname.com</strong>) So if you get an offer for stay at home jobs from a personal Gmail, Yahoo or Hotmail ID, that&#8217;s worrisome and you should not trust the job poster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Job description</h3>



<p>Another way to find out if a company is legitimate is if the stay at home job offer has a detailed job description that matches what you do for a living. If the job description is too vague. Or maybe it offers a job you&#8217;re not trained for. And they propose to train you on the job, then it&#8217;s probably a job scam.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Personal information</h3>



<p>A surefire way to spot a job scam is when a potential employer asks for your personal information such as your social security number, your bank details etc. during, or right after the interview even before they hire you. Just make sure you never give out personal details on an interview call for stay at home jobs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Application fee</h3>



<p>This is probably one of the most obvious ones. But sadly, people who really need a job, and are not well versed with how the online world works, can get trapped into an employment scam like this. A company will ask for a nominal fee so they can interview you, or hire you. THIS IS THE REDDEST FLAG YOU WILL EVER SEE. No job can require you to pay so you can get hired. No matter what they say, do not ever pay a company to hire you. It always works the other way around.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How should you find legitimate stay at home jobs?</h2>



<p>When looking for legitimate stay at home jobs, it&#8217;s always a good idea to find them on legitimate websites that allow <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">job seekers</a> and posters to come together and find the perfect match.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Social platforms</h3>



<p>LinkedIn is your safest bet. You can filter your search options to find stay at home jobs, and find legitimate employers and organizations easily.</p>



<p>Facebook and Instagram have also become budding job seeking and posting portals. You just need to be scrolling at the right time, and at the right place, and you never know, you might just find the perfect job.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use remote job portals to find stay at home jobs</h3>



<p>Other remote job portals work best when looking for stay at home jobs, such as Upwork, Fiverr, We Work Remotely, etc.</p>



<p>We personally love We Work Remotely!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s been a while that most of us have been lucky enough to be working in our PJs from home. And safe to assume, we&#8217;ve come to love this temporary shift of our day job into online jobs. While some of us might be desperately waiting for our social gatherings to go back to normal, one thing most of us are dreading now is the normal work world could resume any day, putting an end to the era of work from home jobs. And before we know it, it will demand our presence in the offices for a major chunk of our time in the day. Therefore, our only plausible escape remains to Google &#8216;freelance jobs for beginners&#8217; or &#8216;freelance jobs for students&#8217; wondering if we can make it a full-time career.</p>



<p>So is it possible to continue working from home, even after the pandemic is over? Maybe you&#8217;ve been going to work all along, even amidst a pandemic on the rise. Or maybe you were let go because of the pandemic and had no other choice but to find online jobs to pay the bills (and have now come to love it.)</p>



<p>Whatever your reason, you&#8217;re here for an answer. So let&#8217;s deep dive into the possibilities, as well as the pros and the cons of becoming a (full-time) freelancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-anyone-become-a-freelancer">Can anyone become a freelancer?</h2>



<p>That surely depends on the kind of work you do for a living. Additionally, the conditions of being a freelancer would also vary with the kind of occupation you do. With the internet boom and most work requiring just a laptop and a stable internet connection, it is quite possible to find online jobs across all fields.</p>



<p>However, if your work requires physical presence, you can still look at becoming a freelancer. If not for finding work-from-home jobs, it can allow you the possibility of setting your own hours in the least.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-pros-of-working-from-home">What are the pros of working from home? </h2>



<p>Excited? Let&#8217;s look at a few pros of becoming a freelancer. We will also tell you about how to look for freelance jobs for beginners. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-have-the-freedom-to-make-your-own-schedule">You have the freedom to make your own schedule</h3>



<p>The number one reason for hating your regular 9-5 could be well.. the 9 &#8211; 5. You have to clock in at a certain time. You can&#8217;t leave before a certain time. And you have to deal with all the drama that ensues in between.</p>



<p>But when you&#8217;re a freelancer with work from home jobs, you aren&#8217;t as time-bound as you are at a regular job. No one can demand you to clock in or clock out. And all you need to keep in mind is submission of your work within the deadlines.</p>



<p>But stay wary though. You either have to have super organizational skills and be a self-motivator or have to be willing to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn those skills</a> to make it as a freelancer. Otherwise, you&#8217;d end up working online jobs ALL DAY LONG. And being in your PJs wouldn&#8217;t help even a tad bit.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-will-have-to-look-for-online-jobs">You will have to look for online jobs</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s not easy. But thanks to the pandemic (can&#8217;t believe we can actually write that), <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are a lot more online jobs</a> than before. So becoming a freelancer or looking for work from home jobs can give you better results now, owing to the increased numbers of such online jobs.</p>



<p>But that said, you still have to put in a lot of effort to find a good job that pays well and doesn&#8217;t exploit your time or energy. Especially if you&#8217;re looking at freelance jobs for beginners. And oftentimes, you have to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/do-this-while-you-wait-to-hear-from-a-job-interview-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">wait for a long time to hear back</a> from a potential job.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-and-how-exactly-do-you-find-a-job-online">And how exactly do you find a job online?</h4>



<p>There are several basic ways to look for online jobs, but you&#8217;d have to do it all simultaneously to increase your chances of finding a good fit.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trusted-job-portals">Trusted job portals</h5>



<p>Spruce up your resume and stay active on portals such as LinkedIn, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Upwork</a>, Fiverr, etc. Make a kickass portfolio and keep it ready to send through when you get in touch with a potential client.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-media-websites-and-groups">Social media websites and groups</h5>



<p>A lot of employers are looking for people on social media &#8211; especially for marketing-related roles. So join some groups that post online jobs. You will find plenty work from home jobs, freelance jobs for students, and freelance jobs for beginners on such groups. The next step is to stay active in these groups.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tap-into-your-network">Tap into your network </h5>



<p>If you know people who work in the HR department, consider getting in touch with them for potential work from home jobs. Connect with previous colleagues and ask around if they personally know any freelancers or people looking for freelancers. Knowing freelancers will help you enter this world and find online jobs for yourself!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-are-there-any-downsides-to-being-a-full-time-freelancer">So are there any downsides to being a full-time freelancer?</h2>



<p>Now before you&#8217;re determined to find your dream online jobs, let&#8217;s look at a few downsides that you need to be aware of. However tempting it may seem, the truth is, that it&#8217;s not for everyone.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beware-of-scams-when-looking-for-online-jobs">Beware of scams when looking for online jobs</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, with an increase in demand for online jobs, a bigger scam employment market has crept up online. So you have to be extra careful when looking for work from home jobs and freelance jobs for students. Stay wary of all red flags so you don&#8217;t become a victim in these troubling times. Especially if you&#8217;re on the lookout for freelance jobs for beginners.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understand-the-process-of-making-money-in-online-jobs">Understand the process of making money in online jobs</h3>



<p>Firstly, your payments will be irregular, depending on the type of clients, and how many of those you have. Many freelancers find managing administrative tasks difficult. One such task is generating and sending invoices for completed work. Thankfully, there are tools available to streamline this process, such as <a href="https://www.invoicesimple.com/invoice-template/excel-invoice-template" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">invoice templates for Excel</a>. These templates can simplify billing and payments, allowing freelancers to focus more on their core activities rather than manual calculations.</p>



<p>Secondly, you will be responsible for your own payments when working online jobs. You&#8217;ll be sending invoices and following up with the client in case of delay &#8211; as opposed to a regular paycheck at the same time every month at a regular job. And one thing all freelancers dread &#8211; you&#8217;d also have to learn to do your own taxes!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-accept-the-job-insecurity-that-comes-with-it">Accept the job insecurity that comes with it</h3>



<p>Because of a lack of personal relationship with your client and lack of accountability, you have less job security when you&#8217;re freelancing. And it can be rather erratic to find and sustain online jobs and freelance jobs for students.</p>



<p>In conclusion, becoming a freelancer comes with its risks. But if you&#8217;re determined to become a successful freelancer, you shall become one!</p>



<p>Good luck to you.</p>

<p>Hey there, Meme squad! How&#8217;s your dreaded workcation going? 2020 started with a loud <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coronavirus</a> bang, which continues to rage still. Remember that time in March when we thought this work from home saga will be over by May? (Let&#8217;s all laugh at our naivety together). Well, it&#8217;s October, and no matter how great your Halloween costume is, 2020 is the scariest thing we&#8217;ve seen in a long time.</p>



<p>While most of us are moping or having a mental breakdown every week &#8211; the internet has found memes to turn our &#8220;new normal&#8221; &amp; &#8220;work from home&#8221; misery into humor. So folks, this series of work from home memes goes out to all who&#8217;ve spent the last couple of months being interrupted on Zoom calls by their coworkers, mailman, and crappy internet service. </p>



<p>So don&#8217;t look around! Here are 20 Work From Home Memes That Show We Are In This Together!</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it, 2020 has been a year of significant change.</p>



<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals all over the world have had to make the decision to work from home.</p>



<p>While you might enjoy the routine of working from an office, 2020 has shown us that staying home to work isn’t as bad as we thought it would be!</p>



<p>In fact, there are plenty of benefits. When you work from home, there’s no need to worry about long commutes or showing up late to meetings&#8230; plus, you can wear sweatpants all day!</p>



<p>So, how do you navigate working from home while <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-living with a roommate?</a></p>



<p>From Zoom meetings to business calls, it can be hard to stay focused and keep work private while living with another person.</p>



<p>Here are a few tips to help you work from home effectively while living with roommates!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-create-a-schedule">Create a schedule</h2>



<p>Creating structure is an absolutely crucial part of working from home efficiently when living with a roomi or roommates. Why? Because can be super easy to get distracted when sharing a space with another person! If your roommate is on a different schedule than you and spends their days watching Netflix on full volume while you’re trying to make a business call, things can get tricky.</p>



<p>In order to avoid schedule clashes with your roomi, try and map out your days during the week in terms of what time your meetings fall, or when you really need some quiet time to knuckle down. Let your roommate know when it’s okay to make noise in the kitchen and when you really need the apartment to be quiet. Creating a schedule for yourself will help you and your roommate structure your time more efficiently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-be-flexible-life-happens">Be flexible, life happens!</h2>



<p>Sometimes things don’t work out the way we want them to, and that’s okay!</p>



<p>When working from home, there are a number of distractions that can arise compared to when working from an office. We can&#8217;t always control outside factors, so we need to be able to be flexible with our schedule and structure! Maybe there’s construction going on in your apartment, or your roommate is working out in the living room? if you can&#8217;t block out the noise and focus. why not head to your local coffee shop to complete your work instead of working from your apartment that day? Try and remember that life happens and issues can come up unexpectedly, and sometimes you just have to run with it!</p>



<p>Take a deep breath and try and remain relaxed and flexible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-create-a-daily-routine">Create a daily routine</h2>



<p>Making a routine for yourself will help you feel more normal amongst these challenging times. Just because you’re working from home, it doesn’t mean that your professionalism has to go out of the window (the sweat pants can stay of course!). Make sure that you go to bed at the same time as you would normally, wake up early, and eat breakfast before you start your day. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great option to incorporate daily planner templates into your daily routine to plan your day effectively and maintain a structured schedule. Be sure to wear a professional work shirt in order to make you feel the part, and if you can, encourage your roomi to get into a work routine with you &#8211; it’ll make creating structure much easier!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-communicate-with-your-roommate">Communicate with your roommate</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/why-is-my-roommate-not-talking-to-me-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">As with any relationship, communication is key!</a> Working from home is a huge life change for everyone, and it may take some time for you and your roommate to get used to your new routine. Be sure to communicate with your roomi about what you need from them in order to work efficiently and effectively. Your job depends on it! Set aside blocks of time when you need the apartment to be quiet and decide which area in your apartment will act as your office space, even if it is a corner in your bedroom. It’s important to separate your relaxing area from your work area.</p>



<p>Let your roommate know if something isn’t working for you, and make sure that they do the same with you! After all, you’re in this together!</p>

<p>With the pandemic life becoming regulated <em>(thanks to the &#8216;new normal&#8217; terms)</em>, more and more offices are demanding their employees to get back to work in their physical offices. While most employees are okay with not working remotely, others are anxious about traveling to work. Mostly because that means coming into contact with people. If your boss is calling you to the office, just use these tips to convince them to let you work from home.</p>

<p>However, there are plenty of teleworking roles that can be managed remotely. This includes roles such as copywriters, social media managers, designers, and sales jobs. Analyze your role to the finest detail. Moreover, read your job description and note tasks that can be managed from home. This activity will come in handy when you want to propose WFH to your bosses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make sure you&#8217;re good at what you do!</h2>

<p>Your bosses won&#8217;t let you take this remote working opportunity if they don&#8217;t even trust you with your work. So it&#8217;s essential to know your place! If you&#8217;re not a top performer well versed with culture and operations, your boss can easily hire someone new to replace you. We recommend that you ask yourself the following questions before you present this idea to your employers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>What&#8217;s your track record when it comes to performance reviews?</li><li>Did you make any recent mistakes? If so, how did you recover?</li><li>How&#8217;s your rapport with your coworkers &amp; clients?</li><li>Have you received a mention/positive feedback from clients or team leads?</li><li>What&#8217;s your USP?</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Explore what&#8217;s working remotely means for the company and your boss</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>Your bosses will have to weigh many essential questions before they give you the go-ahead for this.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Will this impact your productivity &amp; output?</li><li>Does this make life harder or easier for your coworkers?</li><li>Will other coworkers demand the same treatment?</li></ul>



<p>Fortunately, there are many tangible benefits for companies implementing remote working jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Increased employee productivity</li><li>Increased employee morale &amp; health</li><li>Decreased spread of the coronavirus contagions</li><li>Lower employee turnover</li><li>Increased sense of ownership to drive tasks to completion</li><li>Lesser stress levels = Less downtime/sick days</li><li>Less expenses on electronics, office bills etc.</li></ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Better emergency preparedness (59%)</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Improved employee attitudes (58%)</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Better recruitment (35%)</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Better retention (35%)</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Reduced employee commute miles (29%)</li></ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Reduced real estate costs (17%)</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Reduced energy use (13%)</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;56% of jobs in the U.S. are now compatible with at least occasional remote work. And the number of people working from home “occasionally” increased from 37% in 2015 to 43% in 2016.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get clear on the &#8216;why&#8217;.</h2>

<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to talk about your apprehensions about joining work in the middle of a pandemic. The coronavirus outbreak is an unforeseen crisis that has impacted many lives and continues to do so. Make a list of things that make you want to work from home right now. </p>



<p>For instance:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Taking public transport</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Interacting with groups in the office</li></ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Anxiety about passing it on to elderly parents or grandparents who are most at risk of the virus</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Strike a deal! Present your idea &amp; negotiate.</h2>



<p>Talk to your superiors about your idea and try to understand their concerns. Carry a positive and problem-solving mindset to this meeting, and don&#8217;t hesitate to speak about your genuine worries. Empathy is a big part of business organizations, and chances are that your employers will be supportive and understanding of your decisions. If your employer feels it&#8217;s too early to take this step, here are some other tips that&#8217;ll come in handy:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Move-in with a roomi: Consider moving in with <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-to-do-if-your-roommate-has-covid-symptoms-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommates</a> if you&#8217;re living with older parents or grandparents</li><li>Suggest a trial run if your bosses aren&#8217;t totally convinced with the idea</li><li>Negotiate and offer to come in once a week instead of every day</li></ul>

<p>Before we get started on how to create the perfect workspace at home, here&#8217;s your daily reminder to straighten your back when you work from home. Now, moving on!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been 6 months since we&#8217;ve been spending time in a work from home situation. And chances are, most of us are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">still trying to find that sweet spot</a> of the perfect workspace. And one that intersects optimal productivity and comfort to get your through 8 business hours. </p>



<p>There are many DIYs to inspire you to re-do your workspace at home. But if you&#8217;re renting a fairly small space, the landlord might not want you overstepping.</p>



<p>However, the great thing about re-doing your workspace at home is that it doesn&#8217;t take a lot of effort (or money.) To create the perfect workspace requires no alteration to the property you are renting.</p>



<p>But what does it mean to have the perfect workspace? A work space that feels right. And one that helps you avoid distractions the best you can, so you can work the way you like. Basically, the kind that doesn&#8217;t make you want to doze off after reading just 3 emails.</p>



<p>Here are our key pointers that will make all the difference to your work from home days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. The desk for your perfect workspace at home</h2>



<p>Ergonomics calls for matching your workspace to your work needs. Rule number one is matching the top of your monitor to your eye level. However, setting a functional desk also requires other additional components that we will cover in just a second. But the perfect workspace requires, well, nothing at all. Yep, a clutter-less desk is one of the key components to optimizing your productivity. Some people swear by standing desks. These keep the posture correct, especially for those with more severe issues. And also allows you to take a healthy amount of breaks, which are just as much of a need during this work from home period.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. The chair for your perfect workspace at home</h2>



<p>They key to not dozing off when working from home is creating a comfortable space that isn&#8217;t too comfortable. All you need is cushioning and ample armrest. Nothing more/less. That is basically it to make your perfect workspace. Get a cushion to support your back and make sure your arms are slightly lifted at the shoulders at all times &#8211; if not, they cause your shoulders and neck to work overtime inflicting long term posture issues.</p>



<p>The backrest of your chair is possibly the most important component in keeping your posture in check, keep you working for the exact amount of time you need to, by keeping the pain away. We definitely recommend investing in a comfortable, quality chair to create your perfect workspace. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The window</h2>



<p>Believe it or not, some people prefer working in slightly darker rooms. But countless studies show that natural light can charge our work-time productivity and make a substantial difference to our moods. Harvard Business Review goes as far as calling natural light, <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/09/the-1-office-perk-natural-light" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the number 1 perk employers can offer their employees.</a></p>



<p>For this reason alone, we recommend setting up shop as close to a source of natural light as you can to create the perfect workspace at home. Even if you are working from your bed in a friend&#8217;s basement, optimize all sources of light through hacks like mirrors and clutter-less furniture. That fresh air is a great supplement for your 4th cup of coffee. Maybe not the 1st or the 2nd, but definitely for the 4th.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The décor for your perfect workspace at home</h2>



<p>The simplest of additions, like adding artwork or a funky calendar to the nearest wall in view, placing a plant close by, maybe even some incense sticks can alleviate your mood while you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/20-work-from-home-relatable-memes-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">work from home</a>. Fake plants would probably not have the same desired effect here, as an actual plant comes with some added benefits like helping with stale air, for free.</p>



<p>There are also people who prefer adding accent pieces like a really fancy chair, maybe a cozy blanket nearby, a hanging desk? These are all things that make the space more <em>you, </em>and personalization of home offices is a known trick to make the perfect workspace at home!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The power</h2>



<p>There can honestly never be enough organizing for your perfect workspace at home. Every power-based device you use requires to be charged throughout the day and there are truly, few things as frustrating as a bunch of tangled wires stopping you from finding the one charging cable you are looking for.</p>



<p>Power strips also help you not overwhelm all of your outlets. And make it easier to not fight with your roommate over power points or trip accidentally.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Dealing with the noise when you work from home</h2>



<p>A highly recommended addition to office spaces in general is adding some sort of sound. The logic being, absolute silence can be distracting. White noise playlists are a great replacement for people who find it difficult to focus with lyrical music. There are also tons of &#8220;beats to chill/work/study to&#8221; playlists on YouTube and Spotify with fitting music that can help (increase) your focus. You might need to spend some time figuring what kind of music helps you focus best, so be sure to take your time.</p>



<p>A good pair of headphones are also a great investment if you are living with other people around the house. You can look to brands like Bose for top quality noise cancelling headphones &#8211; though there are also some really good cheaper alternatives available online.</p>

<p>More and more of us working from home now! Maybe it&#8217;s our regular job or we&#8217;re trying to find part-time work to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/7-ways-to-make-money-online-during-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make money online during quarantine</a>. Either way, we wanted to get some WFH office tips from the home experts at HomeLight. So let&#8217;s dive right in and learn how to turn your room into a part time office!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is HomeLight?</h2>



<p>In brief, HomeLight is on a mission to change the outdated face of the real estate industry. They empower people to make smarter decisions during one of life’s most important moments: buying or selling a home. So their team builds products to help their clients get the best possible outcome. And in this case, turning your room into a part time office!</p>



<p>Here’s what they shared with us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HomeLight’s top tips on turning your bedroom into a part-time office</h2>



<p>In the post-COVID-19 world, remote or part-time work is becoming the norm. This leaves many people wondering how they can turn a dedicated space in their home into a part time office. It might be tempting to just drag your laptop to your kitchen table and get to work. But creating a part time office is key to establishing a successful home work environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As more people are working from home, real estate agents are finding that a home office is <a href="https://www.homelight.com/blog/real-estate-top-agent-insights-for-q3-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a feature that buyers are searching </a>for in their next property. Here are some tips to create the part time office that will work for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Create a separate space</h2>



<p>The first rule of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.homelight.com/blog/home-office-staging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creating a functional home office</a> is having an area that is for work and work only. Even if it’s a table that is pulled down from the wall as a desk. How much space you can allocate will depend on the size of your home. But even without an entire room to work with you can get creative! A corner desk in the living room, guest room, or even a closet with the door open will work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One tip to remember with a part time office is that it doesn’t have to be set-up all the time. Having a desk that folds away, or a cabinet to store your work items will help you get things done quicker.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Let there be (natural) light</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="10084" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/roomi-x-homelight-how-to-turn-your-room-into-a-part-time-office/attachment/natural-light-part-time-office/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=1050%2C700&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1050,700" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="natural-light-part-time-office" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="A laptop, water bottle, mobile phone and potted plant on a desk in front of a window, with natural sunlight coming in to make a part time office at home. " class="wp-image-10084" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/natural-light-part-time-office.jpeg?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>To be productive, you need adequate lighting. If your part time office doesn&#8217;t have <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/why-natural-light-is-the-best-apartment-decor-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural light</a>, use wall or desk lighting to create a warm, inviting space. Place your desk near a window to contribute to your focus and alertness for part-time work. As video calls are becoming the norm, consider how the light hits your screen to avoid glare if possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Organize your part time office</h2>



<p>Storage will help you tuck away your office for the day, especially if it is in your living room. So the items to consider are filing cabinets for invoices or other paperwork, drawers for pens, notebooks, or other tools of your trade. If you have the luxury of an entire room with a closet for your part time office, you can transform it into a storage center by adding shelving and cabinets.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Make it ergonomic and sustainable</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="10085" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/roomi-x-homelight-how-to-turn-your-room-into-a-part-time-office/attachment/desk-part-time-office/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=1050%2C700&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1050,700" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="desk-part-time-office" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="A man wearing a grey sweatshirt sitting on his desk for part-time work on his computer." class="wp-image-10085" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/desk-part-time-office.jpeg?w=1050&amp;ssl=1 1050w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When you are working from home whether it&#8217;s full time or part-time work, it might be tempting to sit on the couch and work all day. But this is not conducive to an ergonomic work environment, or to stay focused for several hours. Ideally, you can add a monitor to protect your eyes. And if you have the space you can consider both standing and sitting desk options.</p>



<p>In conclusion, one of the perks of working from home is that you can make your workspace your own part time office, adding touches that will help you feel comfortable.</p>

<p>Working from home is incredible! Right up until your cat spills water on your laptop. Or your roommate starts listening to heavy metal on the speakers. With your neighbor whirring his power tools all day building his time machine, it&#8217;s only natural to feel like you&#8217;re just about spiraling out of control during the day in the era of remote work and jobs from home.</p>



<p>Do you feel like working from home has left you somewhere in the middle between house chores and actual office work? Millions of Americans are a part of an unprecedented experiment in working from home because of Coronavirus. Although working from home has made many people happier, more efficient, and brought flexibility to their lives, the challenge to keep work and home separate still remains. With no one watching, there is no peer pressure and no communal obligations to get the job done.</p>



<p>Here are 5 tips that can help you achieve a work-home balance when you have remote work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Start early when working from home</h2>



<p>Having a schedule and starting your day early is like setting the path right for a productive day when working jobs from home. Did you know that you would gain 15 days in a year if you woke up an hour early each morning?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&#8220;It is well to be up before daybreak, for such habits contribute to health, wealth, and wisdom.&#8221;</p><cite>Aristotle</cite></blockquote>



<p>Setting aside time in the morning with remote work, helps you focus and clears brain fog. And it also gives you time to eat a healthy breakfast, which will make you more efficient. You can channel your fresh energy into action and avoid the long commute to your office.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choose a workspace</h2>



<p>Just because you have the leisure of remote work does not mean that you cannot have an office at home. Make sure to separate the leisure items and spaces from your work items. Your bedroom and couch should not get tangled with work – they are your personal spaces.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Allow the luxury of one distraction when working from home</h2>



<p>Chatty co-workers in the office luring you away from work with lunch invitations and casual talk. Who said that working in the office offers no distractions? Yet, you&#8217;re used to dealing with it. Similarly, allow yourself one distraction when working jobs from home. It can be your pet, your kids, or even cooking meals. Anticipate your distractions, and you&#8217;ll be better at getting back to work with full focus at your remote work.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communicate expectations with people at home</h2>



<p>You&#8217;re likely to have company when working jobs from home. Roommates, spouses, siblings, and parents need to know that you&#8217;re at work when you sit at your designated working spot at home. It could be your presence at your &#8220;office table&#8221; or a closed-door to convey that you are busy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Manage chores</h2>



<p>With you, your chores, roommates/family, and a full-time job all under one roof, we know how annoying it is to juggle everything. One effective way is to &#8216;block time.&#8217; Set aside a particular time before or after your job to finish big chores like washing the dishes, cooking, and sweeping. During your breaks, you can load/unload the washing machine, do a 5 minute declutter, or wipe down the kitchen/table counter. Giving yourself little tasks during breaks is a way to feel rewarded and is better than hitting your bed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had to sit through a job interview, then you know how important your resume is! It&#8217;s a way for you to market yourself and promote your career experience. It has your qualifications for a recruiter or hiring manager to clearly see. Your resume is one of the primary documents they use to decide whether or not you might be a fit for your dream job. But don&#8217;t worry, because Roomi has got some of the best career advice for you! </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s be real —crafting an effective and impactful resume so that you can secure a job interview requires much thought and hard work. A short paragraph of all your skills, experience, and professional history into a crisp document that grabs the hiring manager&#8217;s eyes within just a few seconds is a challenge.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="500" data-attachment-id="7718" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/five-tips-to-spruce-up-your-resume/attachment/meme-about-resume/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meme-about-resume.jpg?fit=800%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Meme-about-resume" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meme-about-resume.jpg?fit=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meme-about-resume.jpg?fit=800%2C500&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meme-about-resume.jpg?resize=800%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Meme about writing a resume for a job interview" class="wp-image-7718" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meme-about-resume.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meme-about-resume.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meme-about-resume.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>So how can you make sure that your brilliance is captured in a one-page resume? A 2018 study by Ladders (online job-matching service) found that recruiters typically only <a href="https://www.theladders.com/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">spend about six seconds</a> reviewing an individual&#8217;s resume.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a tiny window of time to convince a stranger that you&#8217;re the right person for your dream job. The thought is daunting, but that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here- to give you impeccable career advice!</p>



<p> By including specific information on your CV, you significantly increase your chances of landing an interview, no matter what field you&#8217;re applying for!</p>

<p>So, to make the most of your six seconds, here are the five things you should always put on your resume:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-job-interview-basics-focus-on-your-accomplishments">1. Job interview basics: focus on your accomplishments</h2>



<p>This may be an obvious career advice, but it&#8217;s important to say anyway. Having an accomplishment highlighted on your resume looks impressive. Not to mention, it shows you off well. But remember, recruiters care more about the impact of your achievements. For example, how did you help your previous employers and customers? Has your work effort resulted in a sales boost? Can you confidently tell them that an initiative you led increased client acquisition? Or that you were responsible for their boosted revenue? Having the specifics down on paper will also help you during your job interview.  But remember to back your achievements with credible statements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-data-and-examples-will-help-with-the-job-interview">2. Data and examples will help with the job interview! </h2>



<p>It&#8217;s essential to provide data that validate your accomplishment and its impact. The more you highlight your achievements and their impact, the better it is. But the info you provide needs to be specific and linked to your achievement. For example, you can use numbers (everyone loves a good graph!) to elaborate quantifiable examples of success. This will let the hiring managers know that you&#8217;re the one for your dream job.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-a-clean-and-consistent-format">3. A clean and consistent format</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Once you&#8217;re in the room, the resume doesn&#8217;t matter much,&#8221; </p>
<cite>Laszlo Bock, former senior VP of people operations at Google.</cite></blockquote>



<p>But, to ensure yourself a job interview, your resume should be near perfect. But don&#8217;t worry, we have some great resume, or rather, career tips- </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use only black ink on white paper with half-inch margins.</li>



<li>Make sure all columns are aligned. </li>



<li>Keep <a href="https://picsart.com/fonts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fonts</a>, sizes, and spacing consistent. </li>



<li>Keep your resume tight. </li>



<li>Craft a concise and focused bio.  </li>



<li>Prioritizes the most critical information. </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-personal-touch">4. Personal touch</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re desperate to get a job interview, you may want to send the same resume to 50 different employers. But that&#8217;s not such a great idea. Your goal is to advance to the next round of the process. So, it is better to tailor your resume to match the job description. There is no better career advice than this. </p>



<p>While you&#8217;re at it, don&#8217;t just rely on your resume to get a job. Look for other ways to make your personality shine. Sending a cover letter could help you communicate more about who you are and what you can contribute to the company.&nbsp;It&#8217;s an excellent way to give the hiring manager a sense of your unique self, something quite challenging in a resume alone.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-links-to-relevant-urls">5. Links to relevant URLs</h2>



<p>It can be stressful for the recruiters to review resumes back-to-back. Try making the hiring manager&#8217;s job easier by making explicit connections between your experiences and the job you want. This includes a link to your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/how-to-make-your-profile-stand-out-on-linkedin/1366/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn profile</a>, your blog, or your online portfolio. Because once they know how you can be helpful to their organization, you&#8217;re more likely to get a job interview.</p>



<p>So, now that you know how to write a great resume, get to work!  Use these amazing career tips to make your resume ready and get yourself one step closer to that dream job.</p>

<p>Hey there, procrastinators, are you all set to leave your old ways behind and be productive? Many of us are spending a lot of time indoors as work from home becomes our new reality because of COVID. While this may be something you&#8217;ve yearned for for years, it somehow feels challenging to be productive in quarantine, especially because there&#8217;s no one watching you. Working from your home office just doesn&#8217;t feel right.   </p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you start work way after sunrise or at the witching hour, whether you&#8217;re a full-time employee or a freelancer. These tips are for anyone having hard time working from their home office. Let this article be your guide whenever the lines between comfort and work start to blur.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-define-a-work-from-home-station">1. Define a work from home station</h2>



<p>If you are like 98% of us who get distracted easily, you need a workstation like an island; serene but cut off from the world. Are you familiar with the distractions of the bed and the seduction of those crisp fresh sheets that call you to nap? This is by far the hardest part of working from home. Don&#8217;t fall victim to those temptations &#8211; separate your workstation from your nap station. Start by dedicating a corner or a room as your &#8216;workplace&#8217;. That way, when you enter it, you know, you are &#8216;going to work&#8217;. Bottom line &#8211; don&#8217;t try to sleep where you work and don&#8217;t try to work where you sleep. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-set-a-work-from-home-schedule">2. Set a work from home schedule</h2>



<p>Imagine reaching your 10 am shift at the office by waking up at 10 am. Impossible right? Unless you&#8217;re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(Barry_Allen)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barry Allen</a> &#8211; then it&#8217;s possible! For a successful work from home scenario, you need to work exactly how you used to work at the real-life office. If you used to wake up at 8 to exercise and commute to work, try following the same pattern with your work from home regime. Switch your otherwise commute time with a shower, prepping coffee, enjoying a hearty breakfast, or studying your to-do list. For all of the harm it has caused, COVID has also brought with it the gift of time for a lot of us. Use it wisely. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-don-t-work-from-home-in-your-pjs">3. Don&#8217;t work from home in your PJs</h2>



<p>We are all guilty of this. Working in our PJs and throwing a shirt on top for those office conference calls has become the &#8216;new normal&#8217; during quarantine. However, <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/working-from-home-tips-get-dressed-never-wear-pyjamas-stay-productive-psychology/368185#:~:text=Sure%2C%20staying%20in%20your%20PJs,sleep%20patterns%20and%2C%20perhaps%20most" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies suggest</a> that staying in your PJs all day long may adversely affect your mental health, focus and productivity.  And no one wants that when you&#8217;re already in the middle of dealing with COVID.</p>



<p>We are a product of routine, and getting dressed every day plays a huge part in our daily routine. One of the biggest luxuries of work from home is the freedom to wear what you want. So ditch your regular sleepwear and get into those comfy clothes and only change into your PJs when you decide to call it a day.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-declutter">4. Declutter</h2>



<p>All the messy people in the house get your hands up&#8230;and clean. If your workstation adorns superhero miniatures, tangled up wires, and dishes from last night &#8211; it&#8217;s time for you to put those things away and declutter. COVID is already stressful enough, you don&#8217;t a messy home environment to make it worse.</p>



<p>An ideal desk should be close to a window and have all the stuff you need, like a bottle of water, quick snacks, and stationery. The goal is to avoid distractions, your trips to the fridge, and to maximize productivity. And who knows, maybe you&#8217;ll finally be able to revamp your home decor in quarantine!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-give-yourself-a-break">5. Give yourself a break</h2>



<p>Just because you&#8217;re at home all the time because of quarantine, doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t need a break. After all, most people haven&#8217;t been able to relax since they found out about COVID. But you need to schedule break times and use them to recharge (come what may). This will increase your productivity, especially when you start boring tasks that you have been procrastinating over for a while.   </p>



<p>When beginning these tedious tasks, set a 15-minute timer and train yourself to focus. When you know that there is light at the end of this dull tunnel, you will glide through it like a pro. Make sure your breaks are not more than 10 minutes, or this activity will turn counterproductive. ou can even consider playing PC games during your break and use your favorite game items, such as a <a href="https://www.yuplay.com/product/fortnite-catwomans-grappling-claw-pickaxe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Catwoman pickaxe</a>, to unwind and refresh your mind.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-prepare-your-to-do-list-and-your-meals-the-night-before">6. Prepare your to-do list and your meals the night before</h2>



<p>The pain of working from home and prepping your meals alongside this is something that we are all too familiar with. Save yourself the trouble and prep your meals and your to-do list the night before &#8211; it saves you plenty of time and energy and is something the entire Roomi team swears by. How else do you think you get an article every day?! Also, for all of you living on instant noodles and potato chips &#8211; get yourself a real meal, you guys! You can become amazing home chefs by the time quarantine ends if you start now! </p>
