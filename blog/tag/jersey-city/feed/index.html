										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Jersey City is the largest city of Hudson county, and the second most populous city in the state of New Jersey. Ellis islands, a part of Jersey City are also regarded as New York&#8217;s sixth borough, given their proximity and accessibility by rapid transit to Manhattan, Jersey City and Hudson County. And its proximity to New York City has helped develop Jersey City into a hub of commerce, industry, and residential development. So if you&#8217;re looking for rooms for rent in Jersey City, here&#8217;s all you need to know about the city.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Jersey City</h2>



<p>Jersey City is located on the peninsula known as Bergen Neck, with a waterfront on the east at the Hudson River and New York Bay and on the west at the Hackensack River and Newark Bay. Being one of the major port of entry for immigration to the U.S., as well as a major employment center, Jersey city is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world!</p>

<p>Jersey City is also home to the tallest buildings in New Jersey, including the Goldman Sachs tower, which tops out at 781 feet tall. Additionally, the major international ports like port Jersey and the International Matex-Tank Terminal has given way to redevelopment, making it one of the largest centers of banking and finance in the United States. This has led to the district and city being nicknamed Wall Street West too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding rooms for rent in Jersey City</h2>

So when you&#8217;re looking for rooms for rent in Jersey City, you&#8217;ll find them in Bergen-Lafayette, Downtown Jersey City, The Heights, Journal Square, Greenville and West Side wards of Jersey City.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University life in Jersey City</h2>



<p>In general, Jersey City is a safe place to be in. But of course, like every big city, you should be aware of your surroundings and travel to newer areas when with people, or in the light of day. As <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Torres-2">David Torres,</a> a developer from Jersey City says:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong><em>&#8220;The safest place to live would be in Downtown (Grove Street/Newport/Exchange Place). Places to avoid would be the Greenville section (Ocean Ave) and West Side (MLK).&#8221;</em></strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, if you&#8217;re looking for rooms for rent in Jersey City, you should know that the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-ways-to-save-money-and-make-money-in-college-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of living</a> can be a bit on the high end due to its close proximity to NYC. So it&#8217;s always a good decision to hunt for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-you-should-know-about-living-with-roommates-in-college/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommates</a> while you&#8217;re at it.</p>
