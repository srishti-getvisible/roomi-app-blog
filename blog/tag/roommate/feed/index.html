										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sharing the kitchen has always brought challenges and, in worse cases, cold wars! But if you also, like so many of us since last year, have started to cook meals for yourself, then you’ve suddenly had a lot more to learn about kitchen maintenance.</p>



<p>It’s hard enough doing this alone, and it can go either way when the kitchen is shared – <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/9-space-saving-hacks-for-a-small-kitchen-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially if it’s a small one</a>! It can be the most annoyed you’ll ever be with your roommate, or you’ll work with so harmoniously together that it’s no sweat.</p>



<p>Here are some kitchen etiquette and tips to share a kitchen with roommates peacefully.</p>



<p><strong>Click here to read about <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/groceries-and-roommates-how-to-budget-better-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Groceries and Roommates: How to Budget Better!</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clean up your own messes</h2>



<p>Wash your own dishes as soon as you’re done cooking and eating with them (yes, immediately, if possible!). These dishes include cutting boards, knives, and everything else you’ve used. Wipe the counter and the stove/oven if you see mess. Basically, leave the kitchen the way you’d like others to leave for you! Sharing your kitchen doesn’t mean sharing your mess.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If all of your schedules are <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too busy to afford time</a> for cleaning, hire help to clean your kitchen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Call for kitchen meetings – communicate</h2>



<p>Talk with your roommates about kitchen etiquette and understand each other’s habits. Things will only get better with more communication and there’ll be no space for petty grudges.</p>



<p>For a peaceful kitchen in the house, talk about your expectations and take time to get used to one another’s routines. You’ll also understand what everyone uses their kitchenware for, what groceries belongs to whom, and where to draw the boundaries.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create a cooking schedule</h2>



<p>Too many people trying to use the kitchen at the same time will end in frustration and a dirty kitchen that no one wants to take the blame for. Plan a rotating cooking schedule so there aren’t too many cooks in the kitchen. If Eric leaves home earliest, he should use the kitchen first, and if Salma doesn’t mind a late dinner, she gets to have the kitchen last for the day.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Give your roommates a heads-up if you’re planning a big cooking project that takes time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set some kitchen rules</h2>



<p>A shared kitchen inevitably has some shared items and utilities. Set rules that everyone must follow; they very from “return the knives to their tray” to “don’t use the microwave for long hours on busy work-from-home weekday” to “replace the dish soap when it’s over, for heaven’s sake!” And does everyone get to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/hacks-on-growing-your-own-kitchen-garden-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the kitchen garden</a>?</p>

<p>Two great additions to help you out: a white board with reminders and a fine jar that collects penalties from rule breakers.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clean together or make a plan</h2>



<p>Even when everyone has been cleaning after themselves the kitchen is the one place that just doesn’t stay clean. Decide on a day and time once a week or two weeks, when everyone is free, to join and quickly get the chore over with. Share the chore – many hands do make light work!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Respect others’ kitchen items and time</h2>



<p>It’s very tempting to borrow your roommate’s nonstick pan to make your pancakes, or his clean cutlery. But does he know about it? As long-term roommates, we hope you are comfortable letting each other use your belongings in the kitchen – with permission, of course. Trust one another to be the adult you’d like to see them as. Well, at least to give them a chance!</p>



<p>But reaching for someone else’s groceries is a big no! Unless you have already talked about it and have an understanding of replacing them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="288" data-attachment-id="8536" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sharing-a-kitchen-a-guide-to-peacefully-share-a-kitchen-with-roommates/attachment/what-the-hell-is-happenning/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-hell-is-happenning-.gif?fit=480%2C288&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="480,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="what-the-hell-is-happenning-" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-hell-is-happenning-.gif?fit=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-hell-is-happenning-.gif?fit=480%2C288&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/what-the-hell-is-happenning-.gif?resize=480%2C288&#038;ssl=1" alt="a man standing in a kitchen, looking disappointed " class="wp-image-8536"/></figure>



<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Explicitly discuss what items in the kitchen are shared. For example, everyone uses the towels and the soap, but not that expensive bottle of oyster sauce. Also talk about big purchases and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-must-haves-shared-kitchen-recommended-nutritionists/">how everyone is going to share them</a>.</p>

<p>It could be one of the best, or maybe, one of the worst life experiences to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deciding-between-living-alone-and-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">co live with a roommate</a>.</p>



<p>Keep your expectations low because your co living experience could go either way. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/annoying-habits-to-avoid-when-co-living-with-roomis-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Your roommate could either annoy the living wits out of you</a>. Or they could become your best buddies you&#8217;d never ever want to live without. Nonetheless, you&#8217;ll be learning how to co live with a complete stranger, every single day.</p>



<p>Whatever your roomi future may hold, a great way to kickstart a good relationship with your roommates is a warm and fuzzy welcome!</p>



<p>So whether you live alone, or already share an apartment with roommates, here&#8217;s how you can welcome a new roommate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Feed your roommate a delicious meal</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re moving houses, you could sometimes forget or be too busy to eat. And we all know what happens then. Cue <strong><em>hangry feelings!</em></strong></p>



<p>So the best way to extend a warm welcome to your roommate would be with warm delicious food! You could <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/lazy-roomi-cooking-9-recipes-for-slow-lazy-days-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">prepare a hearty meal for them</a>. Or you could recommend some of your favorite restaurants in the neighborhood and let them have their pick!</p>



<p>And it is probably the best way to break the ice too. Because we all know, the way to all our hearts is through our stomach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Take your roommate grocery shopping</h2>



<p>Nothing kickstarts sharing an apartment better than <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/8-secrets-to-spending-less-while-grocery-shopping-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">going grocery shopping</a> together.</p>



<p>And if your roommate is new to the neighborhood, they might need a guide!</p>



<p>So show your new roommate around the neighborhood, and take them to all your favorite shops. They would be ever thankful, and who knows you might bond over the essentials you like to shop for! And even the kind of munchies you love to take home.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Plan a movie night for your roommate!</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re not much of a socializer, but still want your new roommate to feel welcome, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/movie-marathon-ideas-for-cozy-winters-with-your-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">plan a movie night</a> for them!</p>



<p>Ask them what their go-to movie or series is, and watch with them. Even if you don&#8217;t enjoy what they like, you could pretend for a night so they can feel more comfortable sharing an apartment with you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. B*tch about everything under the apartment roof</h2>



<p>Give them the gossip on your landlord, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/co-living-101-how-to-deal-with-noisy-neighbors-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the noisy neighbors you co live with,</a> or the street dogs in the alley. Start talking about things that mildly annoy you about sharing an apartment.</p>



<p>Like they say, nothing forms a greater bond than hating on something together.</p>



<p>So if you find something they dislike with an equal intensity as you do, take some time to talk and laugh about those annoying things. And before you know it, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-best-board-games-to-play-with-your-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you&#8217;ll be bonding</a> like you&#8217;d never thought of!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Discuss house rules and living arrangements</h2>



<p>As they start to settle in, take some time out to discuss the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/healthy-living-for-you-and-your-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">house rules</a> and living arrangements so they&#8217;re on the clear. Taking suggestions for house rules would work as a bonus!</p>



<p>Ask them about where they lived before. Was there something that they wouldn&#8217;t want to deal with again? Or maybe something they absolutely loved in their previous co living arrangements?</p>



<p>Tell them about the existing house rules but also be open to new suggestions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Welcome your roommate with a sweet gestural gift</h2>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be something big, but <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/give-the-gift-of-a-smile-with-a-quarantine-care-package/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a welcome gift</a> would be a great gesture for your new roommate. A small throw pillow, a candle, incense, or even a pack of chips or cookies, or whatever you think they might appreciate.</p>



<p>The gesture will make them feel less awkward during those initial days sharing an apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Give your new roommate some much-needed alone time</h2>



<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">moving is stressful and tiresome</a>. So while you initiate activities to do together, be mindful of whether or not they would be up for it just yet.</p>



<p>And at the end of the day, just give them some alone time to figure stuff out. So they don&#8217;t feel overwhelmed, and can get some much-needed rest!</p>

<p>According to statistics from the <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://adaa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a> ,<a href="https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics#:~:text=Anxiety%20disorders%20are%20the%20most,of%20those%20suffering%20receive%20treatment.)" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Anxiety affects about 40 million adults (18 and above) in the US every year</a>. Those diagnosed with depression are often found to have an anxiety disorder as well. The uncertainty brought about by the pandemic and more recent events such as the riot on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/where-the-investigation-into-the-capitol-hill-riots-now-stands-99964485787" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capitol Hill</a> has not made matters any easier.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“As the pandemic relentlessly persists, we are seeing the highest levels of anxiety and depression reported since the pandemic hit the U.S. in March,” </em></p><cite><em>Paul Gionfriddo, president and CEO of MHA (Mental Health America)</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Mental health issues like anxiety can be brought on by several things working simultaneously. No one is totally immune, and most of the time, the condition is treatable.</p>



<p>The sooner you catch it, the easier it is to treat. The best way to keep ourselves and our loved ones healthy is to be more aware. In apartments with roommates, it is good to keep an eye on one another. Often, due to frequent lockdowns and quarantining, other support systems are cut off.</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/119838040073639409/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/119838040073639409/</a>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here are a few signs to indicate that your roommate may be having trouble with anxiety:</h2>



<p>Notice if your roommate is behaving in a manner that is not routine for him or her. These are some tell-tale signs of anxiety to look out for. It is important to note that these need to be out of the ordinary for the individual.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are they constantly tired? And have difficulty</strong> <strong>concentrating?</strong></h3>



<p>When someone is constantly anxious, his or her body produces more adrenaline. This puts them in a constant state of ‘fight or flight’ and can make sleeping difficult. So, they are more prone to being tired all the time.</p>



<p>If you suspect something, pay attention to your coliving partner. Has your roommate been forgetting what they usually wouldn&#8217;t? Are they having trouble focusing on a conversation? Anxiety prompts people to ponder excessively on negative outcomes, making it difficult for them to focus.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is their appetite off?</strong></h3>



<p>Since you’re in a shared coliving space, it may be easier for you to spot things like a drastic change in appetite. This is a physical indication of anxiety. Are you noticing that your roommate is experiencing a loss in appetite? Or is it the other extreme? Do you see your coliving companion binge eating unusually often?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Have you noticed them distancing themselves?</h3>



<p>Those who suffer from anxiety feel like avoiding or escaping situations that might make them anxious. Therefore, they have been known to spend a lot of energy devising ways to avoid these situations. If your roommate is avoiding conversations, not really keeping in touch with friends or family. These are indications that he or she is trying to isolate or distance themselves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can you do?</h2>



<p>How can you tell if it’s time for your roommate to seek professional help? As a rule of thumb, if anxiety affects your coliving partner’s daily life and routine, it might be time to consult a therapist.</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/430164201912403987/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/430164201912403987/</a>



<p>Being the one living close to your coliving partner, you would likely notice the small stuff.</p>



<p>For example, if they are avoiding social activities, work, or exercise consistently. These are strong indications that the person in your coliving space would benefit from speaking to a professional.</p>



<p>In apartments with roommates, you may not be familiar enough with one another to broach the subject yourself. In this case, get in touch with their best friend or a family member to share your concerns.</p>



<p>If you choose to speak to your roommate about it directly, remember that people often don’t seek treatment due to the stigma attached to mental healthcare. It is a delicate situation that needs to be approached with care.</p>



<p>Avoid forcing a confrontation. Instead, create a dialogue and a safe space for your friend to express his or her concerns. If you are unsure of what to say, it’s best to speak to a mental health care professional to understand how to do this.</p>

<p>It can be quite difficult to stand by and watch someone else struggle with a condition like anxiety. Whether this person is a friend or just one member of a shared apartment.</p>



<p><em><strong>You may like: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-be-a-good-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to be a Good Roommate</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you wish you could do more, here are some ways to support your roommate:</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Don’t dismiss their concerns. For someone with anxiety, some experiences can be frightening for them but not for you. Belittling their concerns by calling them small worries doesn’t actually make the anxiety stop. Instead, ask what you can do to support them.</li><li>Offer assistance but don’t take over. Helpful friends and family often forget that support is to help someone help themselves. It does not mean that you should take over tasks for your friend. In apartments with roommates, this could mean watching your friend struggle over making a decision. To support your friend, help them list out the pros and cons related to the issue but let them make the final decision on their own.</li><li>Understand more about their condition so you can avoid stereotypes and making generalizations.

<p>Let&#8217;s face it, 2020 has been a year of significant change.</p>



<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals all over the world have had to make the decision to work from home.</p>



<p>While you might enjoy the routine of working from an office, 2020 has shown us that staying home to work isn’t as bad as we thought it would be!</p>



<p>In fact, there are plenty of benefits. When you work from home, there’s no need to worry about long commutes or showing up late to meetings&#8230; plus, you can wear sweatpants all day!</p>



<p>So, how do you navigate working from home while <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-living with a roommate?</a></p>



<p>From Zoom meetings to business calls, it can be hard to stay focused and keep work private while living with another person.</p>



<p>Here are a few tips to help you work from home effectively while living with roommates!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="687" height="1024" data-attachment-id="5499" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-work-from-home-with-roommates-roomi/attachment/pexels-zen-chung-5749818/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?fit=1717%2C2560&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1717,2560" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pexels-zen-chung-5749818" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?fit=201%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?fit=687%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818.jpg?resize=687%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="roomi, roommate, work, work from home" class="wp-image-5499" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?resize=687%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?resize=201%2C300&amp;ssl=1 201w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C1145&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?resize=1030%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1030w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?resize=1374%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1374w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C1789&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C2952&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-zen-chung-5749818-scaled.jpg?w=1717&amp;ssl=1 1717w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-create-a-schedule">Create a schedule</h2>



<p>Creating structure is an absolutely crucial part of working from home efficiently when living with a roomi or roommates. Why? Because can be super easy to get distracted when sharing a space with another person! If your roommate is on a different schedule than you and spends their days watching Netflix on full volume while you’re trying to make a business call, things can get tricky.</p>



<p>In order to avoid schedule clashes with your roomi, try and map out your days during the week in terms of what time your meetings fall, or when you really need some quiet time to knuckle down. Let your roommate know when it’s okay to make noise in the kitchen and when you really need the apartment to be quiet. Creating a schedule for yourself will help you and your roommate structure your time more efficiently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-be-flexible-life-happens">Be flexible, life happens!</h2>



<p>Sometimes things don’t work out the way we want them to, and that’s okay!</p>



<p>When working from home, there are a number of distractions that can arise compared to when working from an office. We can&#8217;t always control outside factors, so we need to be able to be flexible with our schedule and structure! Maybe there’s construction going on in your apartment, or your roommate is working out in the living room? if you can&#8217;t block out the noise and focus. why not head to your local coffee shop to complete your work instead of working from your apartment that day? Try and remember that life happens and issues can come up unexpectedly, and sometimes you just have to run with it!</p>



<p>Take a deep breath and try and remain relaxed and flexible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-create-a-daily-routine">Create a daily routine</h2>



<p>Making a routine for yourself will help you feel more normal amongst these challenging times. Just because you’re working from home, it doesn’t mean that your professionalism has to go out of the window (the sweat pants can stay of course!). Make sure that you go to bed at the same time as you would normally, wake up early, and eat breakfast before you start your day. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great option to incorporate daily planner templates into your daily routine to plan your day effectively and maintain a structured schedule. Be sure to wear a professional work shirt in order to make you feel the part, and if you can, encourage your roomi to get into a work routine with you &#8211; it’ll make creating structure much easier!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-communicate-with-your-roommate">Communicate with your roommate</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/why-is-my-roommate-not-talking-to-me-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">As with any relationship, communication is key!</a> Working from home is a huge life change for everyone, and it may take some time for you and your roommate to get used to your new routine. Be sure to communicate with your roomi about what you need from them in order to work efficiently and effectively. Your job depends on it! Set aside blocks of time when you need the apartment to be quiet and decide which area in your apartment will act as your office space, even if it is a corner in your bedroom. It’s important to separate your relaxing area from your work area.</p>



<p>Let your roommate know if something isn’t working for you, and make sure that they do the same with you! After all, you’re in this together!</p>

<p>Living with roommates can be an awesome experience. A roommate can become a built-in best friend and your go-to confidant. A good roommate is a blessing, but you’re bound to experience different types of roommates with a range of different roommate personalities and habits that won’t necessarily mesh with your own.</p>



<p>Don’t fret, it’s okay to be different from your roommate and you should be prepared to live with a mixed bag of people that aren&#8217;t like you. Here are 6 different types of roommates that you’ll probably encounter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" data-attachment-id="9546" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/attachment/different-types-of-roommates/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="683,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="different types of roommates" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&#038;ssl=1" alt="girl and boy talking to each other in a beautiful white house" class="wp-image-9546" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/different-types-of-roommates.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Slobs, the most common roommate personality!</h2>



<p>This character you just can&#8217;t seem to escape, these roommates will often forget to clean up after themselves and leave their room looking like a mess. These types of roommates are especially hard to coexist with if you’re organized and need your home to be neat and tidy. </p>



<p>If you’re the opposite of this roommate personality, coliving with one might be hard to deal with. If messiness is becoming an increasing problem and your roomi is stressing you out, try having a talk with them about their cleaning habits. Communication is the basis of all good roommate relationships.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. The noisy one, this roommate type can piss you off in 0.001 seconds</h2>



<p>Early risers beware! This type of roommate tends to be a night owl and will stay up all hours of the night. The noisy one will blast music while they’re working and decide to spontaneously rearrange their room at night. Moreover, they often doesn’t realize that they are noisy and that their habits are driving everyone else insane.</p>



<p>If you enjoy peace and quiet, there will definetly be disagreements between you and your noisy roommate. As always, make sure to communicate with them and outline your boundaries. Creating a roommate agreement (that includes set quiet hours) might be a good idea in order for your roomi to have a better understanding of the house rules.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The organized one</h2>



<p>The organized roomi is a blessing! You can count on them to be respectful and to always clean up after themselves when they make a mess. Their room is always neat and they make their bed each morning. The organized roommate will most likely volunteer to do the dishes and clean the apartment. You&#8217;ve struck gold with this roomi &#8211; congrats!</p>



<p>No matter what kind of roomi you are, having an organized roommate is a good one to have. Unless they are obsessive about their cleanliness, their organization skills will definitely come in handy!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The party animal, the roommate type that just can&#8217;t help it!</h2>



<p>This roomi is a social butterfly. The party animal is always down to go to the bar on weeknights and is constantly searching for the next thrill. They often invite people over to the apartment and don&#8217;t always let you know beforehand. The party animal is an extrovert and will always make you feel welcome.</p>



<p>If you’re more of an introvert, having a party animal as a roommate may not be the best fit for you. Be sure to let them know your boundaries and ask them to be respectful of your shared living space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The one who’s MIA</h2>



<p>Most of the time, this roomi is nowhere to be seen. The MIA roommate doesn’t spend much time in the apartment and prefers to do their own thing. They spend the majority of time in their room, but they&#8217;re respectful of your space, pay their bills on time, and are content with staying in the shadows.</p>



<p>If you’re fine with your roommate doing their own thing, this may be a good personality fit for you. As long as they clean up their mess and keep their music low, you’ll get along just fine!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. The perfect match is our favorite type of roommate </h2>



<p>Sometimes we’re lucky enough to come by our perfect match in a roomi. This roomi is one who is respectful of your space, does their duties as a roommate, and is an awesome person to hangout with. The perfect match is a roomi who has a personality that&#8217;s compatible with yours and who you love coming home to have a glass of wine and watch a movie with!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living with a roommate isn&#8217;t always sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes it&#8217;s not possible to get along with everyone &#8211; especially when it comes to dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. When a roommate doesn&#8217;t pay their dues or leaves coffee mugs in the living room <em>every single day</em>, it may be time to evict your roommate. Basically, the bottom line is that you deserve to feel comfortable and at peace in your own home.</p>



<p>Evicting a roommate can be a touchy subject, especially if you&#8217;re someone who would rather avoid confrontation. But there&#8217;s nothing to worry about &#8211; we&#8217;re here to help you navigate through this ordeal so you know what you should and shouldn&#8217;t do when it comes to evicting your roommate.</p>



<p>Before making any rash decisions, we recommend you familiarize yourself with your state&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rentecdirect.com/blog/10-landlord-tenant-laws-to-remember/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenant’s rights</a>. Many states dictate that even if your roommate does not have their name on the lease, they&#8217;re eligible to stay. If you’re both co-tenants, your roommates’ violations of your apartment lease might also put you at risk of being evicted. Once you gain clarity on your rights as a renter, you can make more empowered decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. When should you evict your roommate?</h2>



<p>Evicting someone from their home was never going to be easy. But no one wants to put up with a roommate who’s become a problem either. Knowing when to evict your roommate depends on how uncomfortable you and others in the house are. If your roommate is stealing from you, compromising your security, or bringing in people that have long <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/dealing-with-a-friend-who-overstayed-welcome-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overstayed their welcome</a>, then it’s time to make a quick decision and just evict your roommate.</p>



<p>Maybe the reason for your anger with your roommate is something that they can change or work on. Try having a genuine conversation about the issue you&#8217;re facing.  In case this does not bring in results, take it as a sign and move forward with your eviction plan.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Gather evidence to evict your roommate properly</h2>



<p>Gathering evidence to evict your roommate does sound very Sherlock Holmes. But trust us, you&#8217;re going to need it to build your case. Evidence is simply proof that will make your case stronger, especially if they are doing something illegal or dangerous. So, gather any evidence that backs up your claim eg. take pictures of damage caused in the apartment or the pets that are not allowed in your rental home. Save the rent receipts if your roommate has failed to pay rent or share utilities. Be careful not to violate the privacy of your roommate while gathering evidence.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Prepare for that conversation</h2>



<p>Is it normal to dread this conversation with your roommate? Yes. This conversation is something you probably need to think about and prepare for in advance. It&#8217;s best to go into it with a calm mind. Knowing how to evict your roommate will be a learning experience and hopefully it&#8217;ll deliver the outcome you need.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Finally, tell them they need to move out</h2>



<p>As you prepare yourself to have this conversation, it&#8217;s important to know that the way you present your case will determine how your roommate feels about the entire situation. For example, you don’t have to tell your roommate you don’t want to live with them. Instead, you could say that you want to try living alone or someone else who is close to you is moving in with you.</p>



<p>Basically, you don&#8217;t have to disclose the specifics of why you want them to move out; you can be as diplomatic as possible. Try to keep blame and pent-up anger far away, and you should be mild in your approach and tell them that maybe this is not a good fit, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re not a good person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A scornful look, the silent treatment, and passive-aggressive responses? Yep! Your roommate is definitely pissed and is probably drifting from you emotionally. Perhaps you were once best of friends &#8211; two peas in a pod. But something has changed, and now your roommate is refusing to even talk to you. If you&#8217;re wondering what changed, here&#8217;s a list of things that could be causing those problems with your roommates.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6 Common Problems With Roommates &amp; Their Solution</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Your behavior is inappropriate</h3>



<p>Maybe the reason your roommate isn&#8217;t talking to you is because of the inappropriate comments you pass casually, without even realizing you&#8217;re doing it. Perhaps you made some racist remarks, or made comments about their sexuality, or made fun of them/the things they do. Even if you meant no harm, chances are that your roommate is hurt or upset with your behavior. Ask them what&#8217;s bothering them and why are they being cold towards you. If you ask sincerely, your roommate will open up. Respect their feelings and make amends.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. One of the most common roommate problems &#8211; You owe them MONEY!</h3>



<p>Did your roommate lend you money that you haven&#8217;t returned yet? Are they paying for your share of groceries/food or bills? Think hard! If there have been such instances, then your roommate&#8217;s behavior towards you is justified. Most roommate troubles are centered on the unequal distribution of chores and money. Clear debts with your roommate, and always keep a tab, especially when your roommate is covering for you. Nobody likes a person who forgets to pay up.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Your roommate is introverted</h3>



<p>Your roommate could be a shy and quiet person who likes to read more and talk less. It&#8217;s in their nature, buddy &#8211; you can&#8217;t hold it against them. Give them time and space to open up to you, and by no means try to force a conversation on them. It will only make things worse.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Another one of the most common roommate problems: You owe them an apology!</h3>



<p>You had a crazy fight with your roommate last week, and ever since, they&#8217;ve been giving you the silent treatment. If your half-hearted apology hasn&#8217;t sorted this situation, maybe it&#8217;s time to sit like adults and talk about what&#8217;s bothering each of you. If they&#8217;re acting like a big old baby, take the initiative to start this discussion. Nobody likes a cold environment at home * shudders *.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Your roommate is going through something personal</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re an overthinker, you probably might be beating yourself up thinking &#8211;&nbsp;<em>Why is my roommate not talking to me? What did I do now?</em>&nbsp;It could be that you&#8217;ve done nothing wrong, and the issue lies somewhere else entirely! Perhaps they&#8217;re having a bad day, difficulties at work, are going through family or relationship strains. While you guys are thick and always discuss your problems, this time, they&#8217;re not ready to talk about it <em>(at least not right now)</em>. Give them their space and tell them that you&#8217;re there for them whenever they&#8217;re ready.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Maybe the real roommate problem is that they don&#8217;t like you</h3>



<p>This might sting <em>(a lot!)</em>, but hey, their behavior doesn&#8217;t define you. Your roommate may have suddenly decided that you two have nothing in common and perhaps shouldn&#8217;t talk. There could be plenty of reasons for this and, if this behavior seems unresolved after many conversations,&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">it&#8217;s time to find your soul roommate!</a>&nbsp;You&#8217;re an awesome individual, and no one can take that away from you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roomi advise for problems with roommates</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s natural to fight with roommates or to be in disagreement with them. However, to keep your house warm, lively, and away from negativity &#8211; promote the culture of open dialog. Set this culture from the beginning and always follow good roommate etiquette to coexist peacefully with everyone.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.dadaroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tips-para-elegir-un-buen-roomie.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8594"/></figure></div>



<p><em>Dejar la casa de tus papás y sus comodidades es una de las decisiones más importantes en la vida y sin duda el inicio a una nueva y feliz etapa –si lo haces bien–.</em></p>



<p>Sin embargo, hoy en día pensar en mudarte solo resulta muy complicado. Los altos costos de las rentas en nuestro país han hecho que compartir depa sea una de las mejores opciones.</p>



<p>Dividir los gastos con otra persona es de gran ayuda cuando empiezas a independizarte y como queremos que tengas la mejor experiencia viviendo con&nbsp;<em>roomies</em>, te dejamos algunos consejos que te servirán al momento de elegir con quien compartir depa (y vida).</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Considera la solvencia económica. Haz cálculos claros de cuanto puedes invertir en tu renta y considera que además de eso, independizarte, implica otros gastos. Dependiendo del casero, la renta puede ya incluir algunos servicios, pero hay ocasiones en que el pago de estos es aparte así que tómalo en cuenta. Calcula cuánto pagarás de mantenimiento, luz, agua, gas e internet y verifica que la persona con la que compartirás depa pueda cubrir renta y gastos.</li><li>Escoge a alguien que te inspire confianza. Conoce a la persona con la que vivirás. Aunque no la conozcas de toda la vida, usa tu instinto, si no te inspira confianza no es la mejor opción. Recuerda que compartirás tu espacio y tu vida con él o ella.</li><li>Toma en cuenta los hábitos y los del posible roommie. Plantea desde el principio y con claridad los hábitos que tienes. Todos tenemos nuestras manías, sin embargo este punto se puede convertir en un conflicto si tu&nbsp;<em>roomie</em>&nbsp;y tú no lo platican. Por ejemplo si eres un obsesivo de la limpieza, asegúrate de que tu&nbsp;<em>roomie</em>&nbsp;tenga las mismas prioridades.</li><li>No olvides la compatibilidad. Elige vivir con alguien que sea compatible a ti, es importante no sólo que tengan gustos similares y afinidades para hacer una convivencia más agradable, también lo es para poder saber el tipo de persona con la que compartirás tu espacio. Si tu eres una persona que gusta de las visitas o te encantan las mascotas, elige a una persona similar.</li><li>Conoce tu y su estilo de vida. Verifica que tu&nbsp;<em>roomie</em>&nbsp;no tenga problemas con tu estilo de vida y viceversa. Si, por ejemplo, tu roomie es un&nbsp;<em>party monster</em>&nbsp;y tú no, terminarás odiando al otro cuando no te deje dormir o no recoja los restos de la fiesta de la noche anterior.</li><li>Evalúa la capacidad de adaptación. Procura elegir a una persona que muestre una actitud abierta y tolerante a los cambios. Compartir un espacio implica saber que ambos tendrán que adaptarse.</li><li>Busca que el legido tenga fortalezas que tú no tienes y viceversa. Intenta ver en tu roomie la posibilidad de formar un equipo, así, como si se tratara de elegir a una pareja. Quizá tú no seas muy ordenado y la otra persona si lo sea, es normal que cada uno tenga debilidades, será un extra en su convivencia buscar la forma de complementarse.</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Having a roommate can be an awesome experience, but sometimes we don’t always get along with our roommate &#8211; and that&#8217;s okay! Our roommate doesn’t have to be our best friend and it’s normal to get into disagreements with one another when you&#8217;re practically living on top of each other every day. If you&#8217;re having roommate problems, don’t freak out, here are a few tips that’ll help you smoothen this relationship bump.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Communicate with your roomi when something is bothering you</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/QZ0vFWrpgccsZz4tNh" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/QZ0vFWrpgccsZz4tNh/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Communication is the answer to every question! If you and your roomi have gotten into a fight, it’s important to not ignore them and instead face the issue. This is the person you’re sharing a home with, so it’s important that you don’t have any bad blood between the two of you. Immediately address the issue at hand instead of letting the anger build up inside.</p>



<p>Did your roommate do something that rubbed you the wrong way? Let them know! Finding out each other’s boundaries is crucial when creating a healthy home environment. Set limits with one another and be respectful of your roomi&#8217;s limits. This can help you keep a majority of roommate problems at bay.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Good listening skills can help you stay clear of roommate problems</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o7bucZfOGGG4gWlPy" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/much-fail-3o7bucZfOGGG4gWlPy"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Just as it’s important for you to tell your roomi when something is bothering you, it’s important that you listen to your roomi when they talk to you. Let your roomi know that you acknowledge their feelings and concerns. Even if you don’t agree with what they&#8217;re saying, make an effort to listen, and work together to come to a compromise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Talk to a friend about the problems you&#8217;ve been having your roommate</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:83%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/RiiIImVSYLD7rWrkq9" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/RiiIImVSYLD7rWrkq9/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Don’t know how to bring up an issue that&#8217;s bothering you directly to your roommate? Reach out to a close friend or family member and talk about the problems you&#8217;re having with your roommate. Talking is extremely therapeutic and it can be helpful to get another person’s perspective on a situation. Ask your friend or family member their thoughts on how to approach your roommate with the issue at hand.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Create your own space</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/9tx0gy37p7oXu" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/9tx0gy37p7oXu/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>It’s important that you have your own space when living with a roommate. Whether this space is your bedroom or at a friend’s house, find somewhere you can chill and have downtime separate from your roomi.</p>



<p>If you and your roomi don’t get along, it’s okay if you make plans for time away from them. Crash at a friend’s house or spend time at your favorite coffee shop &#8211; find a place that you enjoy in order to give yourself a break from being at home and help to maintain a positive outlook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Clean up after yourself and respect your roomi</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/9PtfS5tTC8ejlYfCLU" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/9PtfS5tTC8ejlYfCLU/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Relationships are a two-way street, so make sure you’re being a good roommate as well. Whenever you’re done cooking, be sure to take care of the dishes and put away any food that you’ve taken out. If you have friends over and they make a mess, be sure to clean up after them. If you make it clear to your roomi that you respect their space, they will most likely do the same. This practice will help you avoid roommate problems</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. If all else fails, move out</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/S5ExJ6xbV0l9Eo9gWW" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/S5ExJ6xbV0l9Eo9gWW/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If being with your roomi is really unbearable and nothing else has worked, it’s okay to move out and find another place. Stay with a friend or move in with the fam while you look for a new apartment. If moving out simply isn&#8217;t an option, you and your roomi will have to work out a situation that works for both of you &#8211; even if that means planning your schedules so you don&#8217;t run into each other in communal areas too often.</p>
