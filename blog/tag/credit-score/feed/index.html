										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the things a lot of people avoid but sometimes can’t control is bad credit. Having bad credit can make apartment searching very difficult. Your credit score is very essential because it plays a major role when you want to rent an apartment. Most landlords demand to know the credit scores of their tenants so they don’t rent out to a tenant with bad credit. If your roommate has bad credit, this can pose major problems. Here are a few tips that can guide you.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be aware of your credit score</h2>



<p>This is because the landlords have access to <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/who-are-the-three-major-credit-bureaus-960416" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit bureaus</a>. They check if you are a worthy tenant or a tenant with negative information on your credit score. This check can drastically reduce your chances of getting an apartment. You should know what is on your credit report so that you can correct any errors. You should also be aware of your roommate’s bad credit.</p>



<p>Some sites can help you <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-check-your-credit-score-free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">check your credit score</a> for free. You can use <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.creditkarma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit Karma</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.creditsesame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit Sesame</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.credit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit.com</a>, or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.freecreditreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeCreditReport.com</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get financial recommendation</h2>



<p>To avoid situations where your roommate has bad credit, you need to get a financial recommendation before getting a roommate. You need someone to vouch for your roommate’s financial responsibility. This will prevent a situation of your roommate breaking the lease or having to sue your roommate for financial negligence. Your roommate can get someone to vouch for them by contacting their previous or current employers, previous or current landlords, or reaching the bank for a reference letter. Here are some concrete reasons why your roommate has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickclements/2015/09/10/3-reasons-responsible-people-have-bad-credit-scores/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad credit</a>.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Unemployment</li><li>Medical bills</li><li>Divorce</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get a roommate with a good credit score</h2>



<p>It’s said that you can get an apartment if you have a good credit score, even if your roommate has bad credit. However, it’s advisable to only get a roommate with a good credit score to avoid situations of unpaid rent or your roommate not paying for essentials that you both need. If both of you have good credit scores, it will help you make your payments on time and build your financial credibility for the future. Having no credit and a stable income that is 3 times more than the monthly rent is good. It shows reliability and gets you letters of reference from your former landlords when you need them. If your roommate has bad credit, they can submit any document that shows they are working on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-repair-your-credit-960377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repairing their credit</a>.</p>

				</div>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make your payments upfront</h2>



<p>Sometimes it’s a struggle to get a roommate, and when you finally get one that’s in sync with you, the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/bad-credit-when-finding-an-apartment-in-nyc-heres-help/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate has bad credit</a>. It is important to note that not all landlords check either your’s, your roommate’s, or both of your credit scores. This, therefore, enables you to provide proof of whomever’s credit score is better to secure the apartment. In addition, if that isn’t the case, you can pay a higher deposit upfront of 3 months. This will show how serious you are. It will show that you can be trusted and will subsequently ease the Landlord’s concerns. Also, the upfront payment helps to avoid your roommate breaking lease agreement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prove your worth and improve your credit score</h2>



<p>The fact that your roommate has bad credit does not mean they have not been entirely responsible for their finance. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-rent-an-apartment-with-bad-credit-960969">a stable income</a> can help fix their credit record and get that apartment for both of you. A stable monthly income, which is at least three times the monthly rent, will be a great indicator to your landlord when you provide solid proof that you can keep up with your payments. It is well known that <a href="https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/is-no-credit-better-than-bad-credit" class="broken_link">having no credit is better than bad credit</a>. Well, the first step to improve your credit is to catch up on all of your late payments and pay them in full to avoid additional interests. Sufficient income sometimes offsets a negative credit history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Most NYC renters are familiar with the challenges that come with paying rent on time. In between trying the city’s newest restaurants and rooftop bars, prioritizing our finances can feel like a fine art. One that can take <em>a lot </em>of discipline. And most youngsters don&#8217;t stop and think how their decisions could impact their credit score. Here’s the bad news- the ramen and the Bloody Marys are gonna have to wait. Because late rent payments affect your credit score!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/VhQJ2lfCw3RThCZmzw" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/VhQJ2lfCw3RThCZmzw/giphy.gif"></iframe>

<p>So, what if your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-late-paying-rent/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate is late paying rent</a>, or if you’re falling behind on your own payments? Does this really have an impact on your credit score? Here’s what you need to know about sticking to the agreed-upon payment schedule.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-to-your-credit-score-if-you-don-t-pay-on-time">What happens to your credit score if you don’t pay on time?</h2>



<p>Right now, on-time rent payments don’t positively add to our credit score, while late payments can negatively affect our score. Seems a bit unfair, right? That’s why city comptroller Scott Stringer has been fighting to <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/making-rent-count/overview-rent-credit/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make rent count</a>; arguing that renters should be allowed to add rent payments to their credit history, in the same way that home owners do for mortgage payments.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:76%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3orifboWZvOhWnYRvq" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3orifboWZvOhWnYRvq/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>While it might not seem like a big deal if you miss one or two rent payments, there could be some consequences further down the line:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-late-fees">1. <strong>Late fees.</strong></h3>



<p>If your rental agreement includes a late fee clause, then expect to part with a few extra dollars if you’re late. Check your agreement, since the cut-off time could be a few seconds, or you may receive a grace period of a day or two. Either way, aim to pay on time every month, because paying the fee doesn’t automatically clean up your rental history.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-rental-applications"><strong>Future rental applications.</strong></h3>



<p>When it’s <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-signs-time-move/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">time to move into a new apartment</a>, your future property manager will want to know about your track record. They might use property management software or might contact your current landlord, but late payments are a red flag and could get in the way of being accepted to your new dream place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eviction-risk"><strong>Eviction risk.</strong></h3>



<p>Eviction laws vary by state, but you could find yourself with a <em>notice of termination for cause </em>in your hand, signifying the start of the eviction process. In such a case, you’ll usually be given a set number of days to pay the rent in full. If you fail, you might be kicked out &#8211; which has a <em>huge </em>impact on your credit score.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-poor-credit-score"><strong>Poor credit score.</strong></h3>



<p>If your property management company reports late payments to credit score companies, your score will be impacted.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-credit-matter-anyway">Why does credit matter, anyway?</h2>



<p>Your credit score is kind of like your passport to the consumer economy; a good credit score is your ticket to securing <a href="https://www.wagedayadvance.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">payday loans</a> and mortgages in the future, when you need them most. Those with a low credit score (or missing one completely) could find themselves paying extra on their phone contracts, insurance and credit cards interest rates.</p>



<p>You could notice both short-term and long-term consequences, with late payments staying on your credit history for as long as seven years!&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can request your <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit reports online</a>, to make sure yours are looking healthy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-you-can-t-pay-rent">What if you can’t pay rent?</h2>



<p>Repeatedly missing payment deadlines is a big no-no, but we’re all human and sometimes the unexpected happens. If you expect that you’ll be short on funds for an upcoming rent payment, there are some things you can do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talk to your property manager about short-term cash flow issues. Let them know the date you can make payment (as long as it’s only a few days after the deadline). They might just be able to let it slide &#8211; just this once. Remember, though, this isn’t the case for everyone. The best approach is to create automatic monthly bank transfers, so you don’t need to remind yourself to pay every month.</p>



<p>If this is an ongoing issue and you’re struggling to pay rent more than once, it’s time to make a change. Consider taking on an extra roommate, looking for a new source of income or moving to a more affordable pad.</p>
