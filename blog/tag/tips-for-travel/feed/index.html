<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-public-transportation-how-to-get-around-san-francisco-without-a-car">Public Transportation: How to Get Around San Francisco Without A Car</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the city&#8217;s public transportation system:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-muni-transit"><strong>1. Muni Transit</strong></h3>



<p>Muni is the most common way to get around San Francisco as its both the bus and metro system of the city.

<p>Whether you’re traveling across town or just down the street, be prepared for the occasional delay or unexpected sight, warn locals.</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-make-a-travel-budget-stick-to-it/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">How To Make A Travel Budget &amp; Stick To It?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. BART and Caltrain</strong></h3>



<p>BART, or Bay Area Transit, is another popular public transit option run by SFMTA. It&#8217;s the country’s fifth busiest heavy rail rapid transit system. The&nbsp;BART&nbsp;connects the heart of SF with numerous cities in the East Bay and suburbs in the south. In 2023, there was <a href="https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2023/news20230729" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">48 million</a> ridership on BART, so it’s no surprise SFMTA has&nbsp;plans to update the trains&nbsp;to be cooler, more comfortable and less noisy.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi’s tips for travel:</strong>&nbsp;The locals have an unspoken code of conduct for BART riders (no eating on the train, keep conversations and coughs to a minimum, let people exit before you get on, and don&#8217;t take up too much space). Definitely something you should familiarize yourself with before you become&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;rider.</p>



<p>Finally, Caltrain is a another commuter train similar to BART. It’s perfect for traveling between San Francisco and San Mateo and Santa Clara. This is your best bet if you’re trying to get to Silicon Valley from SF. Whereas you might want to take the BART if you’re just going to Oakland.&nbsp;Fares for Caltrain&nbsp;vary depending on the zone you’re traveling between, the number of rides you need, and how you&#8217;re paying. Essentially, using a Clipper Card is cheaper than a physical ticket. It’s best to check before hopping on-board.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis and Ride-Sharing Apps</h3>



<p>Like in all cities, San Francisco also has its fair share of taxis (mostly downtown), and ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft. This may be one of the easiest ways to get around the city, it isn&#8217;t the cheapest.</p>



<p>The base fare starts at $4.15 with an additional $0.65 per one-fifth mile and each minute of waiting or traffic delay. The pick-up fee in San Francisco is also $5.50.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Ferry</h3>



<p>Ferries are a fun way to tour San Francisco. It allows you to go to the Ferry Building and have a spectacular view of the Golden Gate Bridge. There are also a lot of ferry services in San Francisco that can bring you to different places around the Bay Area:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Golden Gate Ferry: going to Angel Island State Park and Larkspur to the north</li>



<li>Giants Ferry: to Oracle Park</li>



<li>Warriors Ferry: to Chase Center</li>



<li>San Francisco Bay Ferry: going to Oakland/Alameda, Richmond and Vallejo in the East Bay</li>



<li>Alcatraz City Cruise: departs from Pier 33 to &#8220;The Rock&#8221; or Alcatraz</li>



<li>Blue &amp; Gold Gate Ferry: to Tiburon and Sausalito from Pier 41</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Cable Cars</h3>

<p>Another option to get around San Francisco is by cable cars. It&#8217;s a bit more historic, so cable cars have limited reach as compared to other modes of transportation. The cable car has three routes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>California Cable Car: Goes from Embarcadero to Van Ness</li>



<li>Powell/Hyde Cable Car: Goes from Powell and Market to Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf</li>



<li>Powell/Mason Cable Car: Goes from Taylor and Bay to Powell</li>
</ul>



<p>To buy tickets to Muni, Caltrain, BART, ferries, and cable cars, you can use a Clipper Card. It&#8217;s the all-in-one transit card in San Francisco that you can add to your Apple Wallet or Google Wallet, or order a physical card online for free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Going Around SFO The Healthy Way</h3>



<p>Perhaps the best news about getting around is SF is you can reasonably forgo all modes of modern transportation. The city is considered as a walker&#8217;s paradise with a 99 walk and biker score. It&#8217;s convenient to <a href="https://www.guruwalk.com/san-francisco">walk around the city</a>, with easily accessible stores and shops all around.</p>



<p>Further, San Francisco has an extensive system of bicycle paths and lanes. Some of which are parallel to traffic and shared with pedestrians — some that are completely separate from both. Thus, walking and cycling form as efficient tips for travel in San Francisco.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Traveling in San Francisco: Extra Hacks</h2>



<p>With all the transportation options, now it&#8217;s time to consider the actual places and things to do in the city. Here are a few extra hacks that can come in handy when traveling to San Francisco.</p>
