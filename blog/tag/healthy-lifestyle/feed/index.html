										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Merriam Webster Dictionary defines stimulus as an agent (such as an environmental change) that directly influences a living organism or organ&#8217;s activity. Think when you look at <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/delicious-thanksgiving-dinner-ideas-to-beat-2020-blues-veggie-vegan-options-included/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thanksgiving dinner recipes</a> (agent) and salivate (influenced activity). So what we&#8217;re saying is, creating a healthy home environment and healthy living habits can help you achieve all #healthgoals you&#8217;ve always wanted to achieve.</p>



<p>Speaking of salivation caused by simply looking at recipes, let&#8217;s talk about Russian physiologist, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/pavlov.html#:~:text=During%20the%201890s%2C%20Russian%20physiologist,a%20powder%20made%20from%20meat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ivan Pavlov</a>. In his experiments, he &#8216;conditioned&#8217; dogs to salivate. And then expect food on hearing a ringing bell, whether or not the food was present in the room.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="500" height="500" data-attachment-id="2694" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/home-environment-and-healthy-living-habits-roomi/attachment/fssfsdfsdf/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fssfsdfsdf.jpg?fit=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="fssfsdfsdf" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fssfsdfsdf.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fssfsdfsdf.jpg?fit=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fssfsdfsdf.jpg?resize=500%2C500&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ivan Pavlov" class="wp-image-2694" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fssfsdfsdf.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fssfsdfsdf.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fssfsdfsdf.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>Why are we talking about this, you wonder? This experiment and its learnings prove we can &#8216;condition&#8217; our brains into doing what we desire when we desire it. Just like the dogs were conditioned to expect food at hearing the bell (stimulus.)</p>



<p>So if you want to stop snacking on junk food and start exercising, YOU CAN! It&#8217;s all about creating a healthy home environment and cultivating healthy living habits for your desired results.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how creating a healthy home environment can train you to cultivate healthy living habits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-creating-a-healthy-home-environment-by-making-junk-food-disappear">1. Creating a healthy home environment by making junk food disappear</h2>



<p>One of the most important healthy living habits is to ditch the packets of Nachos and Oreos for good. The two things that play a major role in making you eat junk food are salt and sugar. They&#8217;re extremely beneficial and necessary for the body in the right amounts. But addictive and detrimental to your health if you consume too much.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><a href="https://time.com/4249709/salt-fat-overeating-sodium/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The taste you can’t resist is due to the sugar or salt that’s often present in fatty foods.</a></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>So it&#8217;s time to bid farewell to those packaged goodies for creating a healthy home environment. For further support in creating a healthy home environment and fostering healthy living habits, you might want to <a href="https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/registered-dietitians" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talk to registered dietitians</a> who are available for virtual nutrition counseling. They can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific health goals, helping you make informed dietary choices as part of your journey. To further support your goal of eliminating junk food and making healthier choices, consider incorporating <a href="https://www.factor75.com/eat/prepared-low-carb-meal-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-carb food delivery</a> into your routine. This convenient option can help maintain a balanced diet without the need to stock sugary or salty processed foods at home, aligning perfectly with a healthy living environment. If you&#8217;re passionate about guiding others in nutrition and wellness, pursuing a <a href="https://und.edu/programs/nutrition-ms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">masters degree in nutrition online</a> could be a flexible and rewarding way to deepen your expertise and make a professional impact. Keep them out of sight, out of mind&#8230; and out of your tummy!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-dedicate-a-space-in-your-home-for-working-out">2. Dedicate a space in your home for working out</h2>



<p>You need to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">separate work from home</a> by creating a designated space to work from. Similarly, you need to pick a space to work out in too! Choose a time of the day. Then choose a space that you religiously devote to moving your body for creating a healthy home environment.</p>



<p>It could be your balcony, porch, or even your living area if you plan to get your roomis on board as your fitness squad! Whichever space you pick, blast some music and make exercising fun to make this healthy living habit stick.</p>



<p>And don&#8217;t forget Pavlov&#8217;s dog training. Condition your mind to keep at it by giving yourself a reward when you exercise. And alternatively, setting up punishment for when you don&#8217;t. Make the punishment hard enough for you to stick to this healthy living habit and the reward good enough to reinforce it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-observe-associations-and-triggers-to-overcome-them">3. Observe associations and triggers to overcome them</h2>



<p>Just like the dogs in Pavlov&#8217;s experiment started to think of food when they heard a ringing bell, we&#8217;ve come to associate munching on snacks with a lot of conditioned stimuli around the house.</p>



<p>An example? When you feel like something&#8217;s missing when you don&#8217;t have snacks while watching a good movie!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“As long as we believe it is food that causes us to overeat, we are lost. Television, friends, and weather seem pretty unrelated to what we eat. That’s why they have such a powerful effect on us.”</p><cite>Brian Wansink, Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Although that&#8217;s fine once in a while, the habit of constant munching can really affect our health (especially with our limitless <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/7-binge-worthy-netflix-shows-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix bingeing</a>!). So how can you mend this for creating a healthy home environment?</p>



<p>Use one of the simpler healthy living habits. Bring fruits and yummy veggies. Pair them with a delicious dip for whenever you sit in front of the TV and munch away!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-creating-a-healthy-home-environment-for-healthy-sleep">4. Creating a healthy home environment for healthy sleep</h2>



<p>One essential but one of the more overlooked healthy living habits is to make sure that you get a substantial amount of sleep every night. The last thing our brain needs is more entertainment before bed. So it&#8217;s time to ditch the smart phone when you&#8217;re trying to get to sleep.</p>



<p>We have some suggestions for creating a healthy home environment for good sleep. Turn off notifications from apps, leaving just phone calls and alarms on. And try keeping your phone away from you or even in a different room (if you can bear it!). Stop saying, &#8216;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/reddit-tips-for-when-you-cant-sleep-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I can&#8217;t sleep</a>&#8216; and start cultivating <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/5-tried-tested-tips-to-naturally-fall-asleep-faster-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good sleeping habits</a> to live a healthier life. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The pandemic has got us all turning into couch potatoes. Quite literally, with our body&#8217;s newly acquired shape shifting capabilities as all the festive food goes in. And we&#8217;ve all been wanting to turn our lives around and finally start exercising, eating better, getting healthier and fitting into our old clothes again. But once you Google &#8216;health tips&#8217; and finally pick the ones that feel right for you, one thing or another gets in the way, making you go over this routine all over again day after day. So we&#8217;re here to help you kickstart your health and wellness regime. </p>



<p>Hopefully, this could be the last health tips blog post you will have to go through. Because this one will make you sing along to &#8216;I like to move it move it&#8217;, while you actually do move your bum.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best health and wellness tips curated just for you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Speaker_for_the_Sad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/Speaker_for_the_Sad</a> health tips involve making friends and roomis your workout partners to stay motivated</h2>



<p>Get a workout partner. There will be many days when working out is the last thing you want to do. Being accountable to someone else forces you to make the effort.</p>



<p>Results may vary if you&#8217;re both lazy b*******.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Andefir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/Andefir</a> suggests taking baby steps when making a list of health tips to follow</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t do everything at once. Don&#8217;t try to go to them gym, eat healthy, no chocolate, no sodas, all at the same time. It&#8217;ll cause you to quit early on. Take small steps. If, for example, you want to cut out soda, try going every second day without it. Then try two days in row and so on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pot69/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/pot69</a> recommends a health tip we all could use when on a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/7-binge-worthy-netflix-shows-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix binge</a></h2>



<p>Instead of watching another episode, stretch for ten minutes, then watch another episode.</p>



<p>Now this is one of the health tips we like!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190810215543/https://www.reddit.com/user/thereson8or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">u/thereson8or</a> tells you to listen to what your body needs for health and wellness</h2>



<p>One of the most important health tips: Listen to your body! We are often in denial of the little voice telling us not to do something or that we crave something. If I have eaten shit for a while, my body almost screams for healthy alternatives&#8230;do it!!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kelbright/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/Kelbright</a> suggests making plans and goals that are sustainable over the long run</h2>



<p>When picking health tips to make your own, be sustainable. Don&#8217;t create this huge workout regime that you&#8217;re going to have to fight to complete regularly. Make a plan that your body and life can handle. Same thing for diets. Crash diets may help you lose weight quickly. But you&#8217;ll be miserable if you try to maintain them for any significant period of time. It&#8217;s better to create a balanced diet that you can enjoy with than to make yourself miserable in the name of health by cutting out enjoyable foods completely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RebelStarPilot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/RebelStarPilot</a> tells us to trick our brains into doing the healthy thing</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s all about tricking yourself into doing healthy things. For example, going to the gym. If you say &#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the gym when I have time/feel like it&#8221;, you probably won&#8217;t go. If you say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the gym everyday at 7pm&#8221;, even if you don&#8217;t go everyday, it is something that is scheduled and you have a higher chance of actually doing it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GIANT_CAPYBARA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/GIANTCAPYBARA</a> suggests maintaining a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/reddit-tips-for-when-you-cant-sleep-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy sleep cycle</a> as one of the most important health tips</h2>



<p>SLEEP.  Sleeping 8 hours a night is one of the most important health tips you can follow to maintain your mental and physical health. Bonus points if you can regulate your sleep time so you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Plus, who doesn&#8217;t like to sleep?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/righthandoftyr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">u/righthandoftyr</a> tells you to understand your primitive mind&#8217;s urges for choosing the right health tips</h2>



<p>Just remember that your body still thinks it&#8217;s a caveman. Your body will always be telling you &#8220;Eat all that sugary food while it&#8217;s here, and store up fat. You never know, you might need that fat if the antelope herds decide to move on to a different part of the valley for a while.&#8221; But we live in a world of reliable agriculture and food preservation now, there&#8217;s no need to store up fat to get through lean seasons that don&#8217;t happen anymore.</p>



<p>Similarly, your body is going to protest about working out. It&#8217;s going to want to conserve your energy and avoid the risk of hurting yourself because it still thinks that calories are precious things to be hoarded and even minor injuries could be a death sentence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">In the end, it&#8217;s not just about willpower or self control</h3>



<p>People think it&#8217;s all just a matter of willpower to stick to a diet and exercise regimen. And that&#8217;s part of it, but a lot of it is just realizing that many of the urges you feel are obsolete mechanisms from a bygone age, and it&#8217;s okay to give yourself permission to ignore them. Half the battle is just learning to separate the real concerns from the anachronistic instincts leftover from our primitive past. Once you can tell the two apart, it&#8217;s a lot easier for the rational part of your mind to assert itself.</p>



<p>We hope you make the best out of these health and wellness tips and feel good about yourself, always!</p>
