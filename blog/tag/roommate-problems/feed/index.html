<p>Adjusting to a roommate&nbsp;can be difficult enough, but when you’re saddled with a lazy roommate, coming back home can seem like a nightmare. As if work stress wasn’t enough, now you have to find time to complete your roommate’s chores as well.</p>



<p>While you may wish to avoid confrontation, in some cases, it&#8217;s unavoidable. So, what would be the best way to ask your roommate to start cleaning up after themselves?</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Looking for a roommate? Here are some qualities to look for!</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Communicate your distress</h3>



<p>When living with a messy roommate, it&#8217;s easy to assume they’re just lazy. However, it&#8217;s best to give them a chance to explain themselves and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/got-messy-roommate-here-s-how-confront-them-528808" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">have a conversation about it</a>. When living with another person, communication is key. There may be several reasons why your roommate can&#8217;t clean up after themselves; perhaps, they just lost their job or dealing with a difficult work situation, or it’s just how they are.</p>



<p>The best way of dealing with a messy roommate is to communicate your distress. Instead of hurling accusations at them, try to frame the problem as something that you need to tackle together. Pointing out your roommate’s flaws may be tempting, but it will only make them defensive and unwilling to listen to your suggestions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pick your battles</h3>



<p>Having honest conversations is important, but it&#8217;s just as crucial to know when to pick your battles. Arguing over every dirty dish, or crumb on the floor isn&#8217;t going to be productive. Cribbing over minor issues will probably lead to your roommate not wanting to listen to you, even when things are their fault.</p>



<p>If your roommate’s laziness is affecting common living spaces, that’s when you should try to convey your unhappiness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Think of your apartment in zones</h3>



<p>When dealing with a messy roommate, you need to accept that your home won&#8217;t be as neat and perfect as you want it to be. If you want everything to be your way, you’re likely to be disappointed. The best way to approach living with a lazy roommate is to think of your apartment in three zones: your space, your roommate’s space, and common spaces.</p>



<p>You have complete control over your space, such as your bedroom, and can keep it as tidy as you like. Similarly, your roommate has the right to keep their roommate the way they like it, although it may not be up to your standards.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Create a chore list or chart</h3>



<p>Although you may assume that your roommate understands their chores without needing to verbalize them, you may be wrong. Creating a chore list or chart helps keep track of what you both need to get done. It also helps that you have a visual reminder of the tasks that you need to do around the house to avoid forgetting or leaving it for the next day.</p>

<p>Sit down with your roommate and try to split the chores according to what you like and what they like. For example, you can wash the dishes then your roommate will wipe them and put them back on the shelf. As much as possible, try to divide chores evenly; you don’t want to get stuck doing all the work yourself!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Try cleaning and organizing together</h3>



<p>If all else fails, why not suggest cleaning and organizing together? Perhaps your roommate prefers group activities or could do with some tips on how to organize themselves better. Cleaning together can be a great way to spend time with your roommates and bond with them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Lead by example</h3>



<p>If you see that your roommate tends to leave a mess in the apartment, try leading by example. Clean up after yourself when eating or after using the kitchen or living room, show your roommate what should be done when it comes to cleaning. This way, your roommate can see how you clean and maybe take it as a sign that they should start cleaning too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Get the help of professional cleaners</h3>

You have to consider that there are extreme cases where your roommate just doesn&#8217;t know how to clean up after themselves, or maybe they&#8217;re going through a hard time that makes it difficult for them to clean. In this case, moving out is the best option, although it isn&#8217;t the easiest, it would be better for you to just leave the apartment and find a better place or roommate.</p>

<p>So you got <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/dealing-with-a-coronavirus-quarantine-breakup-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuck living with your ex because of the pandemic and quarantine</a>, but now you are kinda tolerating each other? Or maybe you just can&#8217;t find someone else or are too lazy to start the hunt. You find yourself relating to all &#8216;living with your ex&#8217; memes, and have accepted the situation as it is. Maybe you even secretly like it (No judgment here.) You&#8217;re happy to be able to stalk them in real life instead of the gram. And maybe you&#8217;ve put all the best rules for living with your ex in place and have found success in cohabitating with your ex.</p>



<p>But wait, does that mean you should continue? If there&#8217;s a doubt, it&#8217;s time for you to get to the bottom of it. Let&#8217;s examine whether or not you should continue living with your ex and how to go about cohabiting with your ex peacefully if you choose to say yes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is it possible to live with your ex?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s like the age-old argument of whether or not people from the opposite sex can be &#8216;just friends&#8217; or whether or not a person can stay friends with an ex. Ultimately, it&#8217;s all about the two of you and the dynamic you share.</p>



<p>No one outside your bubble can tell you how things would go for you. So our suggestion is to understand what goes on between you and your ex. Evaluate how you feel around them, and maybe try and gauge how they feel around you. After all, home is where your heart is. And if yours or your ex&#8217;s heart is broken, the home will be as broken too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should you consider living with your ex?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re considering this question, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be (living with your ex). But who are we to judge? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OSXkHThqrQ">Nick and Jess</a> lived perfectly fine (sort of) after breaking up? Um, we shouldn&#8217;t have said that at all.</p>



<p>On a serious non-sitcom note, if being around your ex is <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/living-with-partner-after-breakup-bad-for-your-mental-health/">damaging your mental health</a>, and stopping you from moving on, then it&#8217;s probably not a good idea. Any negative feelings that might show up when they&#8217;re around are to be acknowledged. It will help you answer the question of whether or not you should be living with your ex.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rules for living with your ex</h2>



<p>Just like you need <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-for-co-living-with-the-opposite-sex/">rules for living with the opposite sex</a>, so you don&#8217;t drive each other crazy, you need solid rules in place for living with your ex. We didn&#8217;t mean to rhyme. But well.</p>



<p>So what are these rules you need to have in place?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Don&#8217;t try to listen through the walls</h3>



<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s weird. So please don&#8217;t do it. If they&#8217;re talking on the phone, don&#8217;t try and stand close to the wall or the door and listen in. It&#8217;s not going to do any of you any good. So do what you&#8217;d do when living with roommates other than ex-lovers. Plug your earphones in when they get loud with their conversations because spiteful exes might try to pull that off just to annoy you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Don&#8217;t make it weird by avoiding them</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s natural to not want to make eye contact and stay shut in your room after you&#8217;ve broken up when cohabiting with your ex, who is in the living room right next to your door. But if you&#8217;ve considered living with your ex, you have to do things differently. Otherwise, you and your ex both are better off (living) alone.</p>



<p>So try going back to normal living in the house, except the coochie coo, and things won&#8217;t even feel much different, or awkward in the first place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Don&#8217;t force them to have a conversation</h3>



<p>It might feel a bit too awkward when you both sit silently far apart on the couch watching TV. But live with it. It&#8217;ll get normal sooner than later. Don&#8217;t try to force each other to talk just because it&#8217;s awkward. If it gets too much, head back to your room for some alone time, just like you would in any other roommate situation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Set boundaries with each other</h3>



<p>This one&#8217;s super important if you&#8217;re planning on cohabiting with your ex! If you and your ex are emotionally and mentally healthy enough to decide on staying together, then this is the easiest part!</p>



<p>Just have a conversation about what the boundaries are. Are you allowed to pass snide comments on the other person&#8217;s date? (Yes, it&#8217;s eventually going to happen, whether you like it or not.) Are you still allowed to enter the bathroom while they&#8217;re taking a shower? Talk about EVERYTHING.</p>



<p><strong>In the end, it&#8217;s all about how cohabiting with your ex goes in the near future. If you&#8217;re not sure but really want to give it a try, do it. But if you can&#8217;t seem to after all trials and errors, go ahead and <a href="https://roomiapp.com/roommates/new-york%20city?page=1&amp;pageSize=30&amp;q=%7B%22region%22%3A%22NYC%22%2C%22minAge%22%3A40%2C%22maxAge%22%3A50%2C%22usrType%22%3A%22both%22%2C%22neighborhoods%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22cities%22%3A%5B%5D%7D">find your next soul (room) mate</a>!</strong></p>
