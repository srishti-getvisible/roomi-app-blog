										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk in the media about loving yourself when in a relationship. And that involves maintaining a healthy relationship with others and ourselves. Also involved is a pretty tough feat of being able to see through the red flags in a relationship. </p>



<p>And the more time we&#8217;ve got to spend at home, we&#8217;ve come to realize that even though building a healthy relationship with your self and others takes work, it is rather important. With the nitty gritty details of our lives, often barging into our heads looking to party when we&#8217;re trying to sleep, it certainly feels like even more hard work sometimes.</p>



<p>Also because that hard work usually involves criticizing our actions and choices. All so we can try and get past them to build and maintain a healthy relationship.</p>



<p>In that process then, we often times come face to face with toxic behaviors. Sometimes our own behavior in a relationship with ourselves and others, and sometimes other people&#8217;s behaviors towards us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-toxic-mean-in-a-relationship">What does toxic mean in a relationship?</h2>



<p>First, stop singing <em>&#8216;you&#8217;re toxic, i&#8217;m slipping under&#8217;</em> in your head.</p>



<p>The thing is, there&#8217;s no clear definition of what toxic means in a relationship &#8211; especially when you&#8217;re in it. And this holds true for the relationship with yourself as well as when you feel trapped in a relationship with someone else.</p>



<p>In brief, a toxic relationship is one where you constantly doubt yourself and have reduced self esteem. And these are just a couple of the many red flags that we choose to ignore when in a relationship. And then it&#8217;s all a matter of degree &#8211; of HOW toxic a relationship really is.</p>



<p>Needless to say, it&#8217;s not just romantic relationships that are toxic. Friendships, families, jobs, and even your relationship to yourself can be toxic. It&#8217;s just a matter of recognizing and then you realize that all your relationships come together in a semblance. And there&#8217;s no ONE reason you find yourself getting into toxic relationships.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-should-we-do-when-we-recognize-the-toxicity">So what should we do when we recognize the toxicity?</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re one of the victorious ones who have managed to step outside of your relationship and really look at yourself in a relationship, you might be a bit wiser now that you can step out and see the toxicity. And for that, give yourself a hug. You are now one step closer to begin building a healthy relationship with yourself and others. </p>



<p>Now maybe you&#8217;re trying to get out of the toxic relationship you&#8217;ve realized you&#8217;re in. Or you&#8217;ve successfully left it behind, and are now self evaluating and contemplating as to why you ever got into one. Or maybe you&#8217;re evaluating how you can stay the f*ck away from toxic relationships and people as a whole.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-we-deliberately-ignore-the-red-flags-when-someone-s-toxic">Do we deliberately ignore the red flags when someone&#8217;s toxic?</h2>



<p>Although reddit says this quote originated from Bojack Horseman, no matter the origin, this one hits home when we talk about red flags in a relationship.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper">    <blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:316px" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoJackHorseman/comments/76nmdm/origin_of_all_the_red_flags_just_look_like_flags/">Origin of “&#8230;All the red flags just look like flags”</a><br> by      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/beermeupscotty">u/beermeupscotty</a> in      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoJackHorseman/">BoJackHorseman</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script></div>
</div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>When you look through rose colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags</p><cite>Author unknown</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And well, there you have it. This is why when you newly get in a relationship and everything&#8217;s rosy and wonderful, we seem to miss out on the red flags in a relationship. And the sad truth about being in a toxic relationship is that you avoid looking at the red flags in a relationship long after the rose colored glasses have come off. And maybe that&#8217;s when love truly becomes blind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-do-we-put-ourselves-in-a-relationship-that-is-toxic">Why do we put ourselves in a relationship that is toxic?</h2>



<p>Mental health expert at Lifehack, <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/778281/toxic-relationships" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">George Alonso lists a number of reasons </a>why we get into toxic relationships &#8211; which mostly ring true. </p>



<p>And deep down, the ones who get into toxic relationships do know when they&#8217;re in one, (and this is the opinion of the writer only, not of the organization) but we also enjoy it to an extent. </p>



<p>Not to say we&#8217;re all masochists by nature. But we enjoy it in the sense, that when our brain knows a kind of love that is toxic, it&#8217;s always on the hunt for known patterns, as opposed to trying something new.</p>

<p>Think about how soon you can get bored when learning a new skill and you hit a roadblock, as opposed to continuing to scroll through Instagram thinking &#8216;I wish I was as talented as that person.&#8217; </p>



<p>Known patterns are the traps of our own minds, even when we know we could do better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-we-learn-from-toxicity-in-a-relationship">What can we learn from toxicity in a relationship?</h2>



<p>As mindfulness suggests, when we&#8217;re trapped in something because of set patterns in our mind, the first step, and sometimes all we can do is to observe our own patterns, thoughts and actions.</p>



<p>The truth is, it&#8217;s often simpler to say that the other person is toxic. &#8216;My boss, parents, SO, friend or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/6-telltale-signs-that-your-roommate-is-toxic-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate is toxic</a>.&#8217; </p>



<p>But it&#8217;s tough to sometimes accept &#8211; that I might be toxic too &#8211; to others and to myself.</p>



<p>Or it might go the other way in a relationship and you constantly cover for the other person. Additionally putting the entire blame on yourself. </p>



<p>However it may be with you, all we&#8217;re saying is: stop trying to find something or someone to blame. No good ever comes from that.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-there-an-approachable-starting-point-to-break-the-pattern">Is there an approachable starting point to break the pattern?</h2>



<p>The first step is to understand yourself. Understand why you went with it in the first place. Was it a desperation or fear of being alone? Or maybe you thought you couldn&#8217;t do better?</p>



<p>Was it because you&#8217;ve only seen toxic relationships in your family? Or if it&#8217;s a job, you think you&#8217;d never find a job that treats you better? Or was it because the other person was manipulative and charming like most toxic people are.</p>



<p>Because understanding yourself is how <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/30-quotes-about-loving-yourself-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">self love</a> in a relationship can begin. And that&#8217;s the only way that toxic relationships can end.</p>



<p>So when you finally see the flaws in yourself and others, forgive yourself, and forgive those around you, but don&#8217;t forget! Take as many learnings from it as you can. And hopefully, you&#8217;ll start a new chapter in your beautiful life and never look back.</p>



<p>Good luck and love to you, dear reader!</p>

<p>The stress caused by a toxic relationship is tough to fathom for somebody who hasn&#8217;t experienced one. But chances are, we all have had at least one toxic relationship in our lives, romantic or platonic. And the worst part is, you can fall into the grips of a toxic relationship, even if you&#8217;re strong, healthy, and independent. Also, while most do, not every single toxic relationship starts off on a bad note. Humans evolve and so do our relationships. We love the idea of love and often give in to it so strongly, that all else ceases to make sense. When the hot pursuit of love turns out to be blinding, the lines of healthy vs. unhealthy attraction and love blur. And sometimes, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/uncategorized/5-things-to-help-a-roomi-through-a-break-up-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">it&#8217;s not until it&#8217;s too late</a>, that people realize they never saw the signs of a toxic relationship.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s us dissecting two very important questions when it comes to being in unhealthy relationships.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are there any signs of a toxic relationship?</h2>

<p>A relationship that makes you feel like your self-esteem and your idea of happiness are completely bruised, is essentially a toxic relationship.</p>



<p>Being able to tell if you&#8217;re in a toxic relationship also takes a lot of strength. And almost no toxic relationships make the leaving part easy. But being aware of the signs of a toxic relationship is an excellent way of equipping yourself, and allowing yourself to analyze your situation. And then move on to finding effective ways of addressing the situation, and getting yourself out of it.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/dealing-with-a-coronavirus-quarantine-breakup-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">What To Do When You’re Stuck With Your Ex During The Coronavirus Quarantine?</a></strong></p>



<p>Of course, not all unhealthy relationships will display all the signs of a toxic relationship that will be mentioned below, but that doesn&#8217;t make them any less toxic. An unhealthy relationship is defined by consistency, and the intensity of the damage being caused.</p>



<p>Here are some of the major signs of a toxic relationship:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sometimes you see the toxicity coming, sometimes you don&#8217;t.</h3>



<p>Being in a toxic and unhealthy relationship feels like a car ride you&#8217;re constantly holding the seat belt for. You know something could go wrong, you just don&#8217;t know when, and <strong>you&#8217;re constantly braced for some reason.</strong></p>



<p>And what follows is a series of blaming aimed towards you that just ends with one conclusion: <strong>you&#8217;re not good enough.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Happiness is an ideal your relationship feels like it wasn&#8217;t made for.</h3>



<p>You just <strong>can&#8217;t get yourself to relate to other couples who are happy</strong>, in love. And your justification always ends up being, life isn&#8217;t like the movies.</p>



<p>The truth is, that kind of love happens for some people, especially those who are open to receiving it. Leaving a toxic relationship is never easy, but staying in one for long periods ensures that <strong>all strength and confidence in you is diminished.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You&#8217;re never admitting your needs to yourself or your partner.</h3>



<p>We all have needs that only certain relationships can fulfill. Some of the most common ones include validation, appreciation, love, sex, connection, and affection. When those <strong>needs become the cause of our mockery, or worse, are ignored and unacknowledged,</strong> there seems no hope in even addressing those needs.</p>



<p>Say <strong>your attempts to talk about what you need normally end in a fight.</strong> Or you&#8217;re <strong>faced with empty promises, accusations of neediness, insecurity, jealousy, or madness</strong>. It&#8217;s time to admit that this relationship is toxic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">There&#8217;s a scorecard ruling your relationship.</h3>



<p>We&#8217;re human, and humans err. It&#8217;s the most human thing we do, and that&#8217;s our way of learning, growing, and evolving. It&#8217;s also our way of finding what we like and don&#8217;t like. And this applies to people too.</p>



<p>But in a classic toxic relationship, <strong>your mistakes will be brought up by your partner over and over again</strong>. And they become a reason for them to go on and do things to hurt you, instead of talking through them and helping you and your relationship.</p>



<p><strong>It just never feels like you and your partner are a team</strong>. And before you know it, you&#8217;re both resorting to <strong>passive-aggressive behavior.</strong> And <strong>nothing ever gets resolved.</strong></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a high chance that the toxic behavior of your partner comes from other people treating them similarly. Toxic people notoriously get attached to people with open hearts, who are less likely to fight and abandon them.</p>

<p>And as we mentioned before, toxic relationships don&#8217;t have to be just romantic. Toxic families are a whole other kind of pain and need years of unlearning and therapy to process.</p>



<p>But for every disempowering lesson, there is one of empowerment, strength and growth that exists with it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Once you know you&#8217;re in a toxic relationship, you have to consciously choose something better for yourself. And then act on it.</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s what we suggest doing:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Do not make excuses</strong> for your partner or family member&#8217;s toxic behavior.</li><li><strong>Limit the time you spend with them</strong>, however, and whenever possible. This might also enable you to process your feelings justly. And take the necessary action required.</li><li><strong>Keep a journal!</strong> This won&#8217;t just help you track patterns that you might otherwise forget. It will also help you process your thoughts better!</li><li><strong>Seek support from family members, friends</strong>, and licensed professionals. You can also seek help once you&#8217;re out of a toxic relationship.</li><li>Find alternative sources of happiness and wholeness for yourself. Do things to relax, reward yourself, and learn new things about yourself. Find ways to make yourself happy and keep yourself engaged. And actively work on undoing your dependency on this person.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Most toxic relationships can be left safely, but for those that can&#8217;t, there&#8217;s help available.</h3>



<p>The emotions involved in leaving a toxic relationship can be manifold. And range from anywhere between sadness, confusion to even anger and rage.</p>



<p>If you no longer feel safe in a relationship because of history of trauma, or violence, we implore you to seek the help of authorities, friends, and professionals.</p>



<p>Here are some helpline numbers that can help you leave your toxic relationship safely:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The truth is that love is one of those things that’s difficult to understand no matter whether you’re 18 or 80. It’s nearly impossible to describe the frustrating-wonderfulness that it is and it can be ridiculously difficult to deconstruct why some relationships work or why others are just not meant to be.</p>



<p>What we are sure about, though, is that some common misconceptions have gotten way more credit than they deserve. In fact, we can all do without them, thank you very much.</p>



<p>In this article, we pick four misconceptions that have no place in a healthy relationship:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Your #couplegoals need to be the same as everyone else’s</strong></h2>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/655555289499609274/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/655555289499609274/</a>



<p>Say you’re scrolling through your feed and up pops a sweet photograph informing you that someone you know has just gotten engaged. Are you happy for them? Of course! But are you now also wondering if you should pop the question to your partner of 2 years?</p>



<p>You should go ahead if you think you&#8217;re ready and feel it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. Be careful to not do it just because all your friends are doing it.</p>



<p>Every relationship is different and goes at its own pace. In a healthy relationship, the pace is set by the people who are in it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>‘Happily, ever after’ means nothing ever goes wrong</strong></h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l0Ex3er7csRTcMz3q" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Ex3er7csRTcMz3q/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>There are a couple of misconceptions to clear up here. The first is that marriage automatically equals happiness. But if you’re unhappy in your relationship, marriage doesn’t automatically make things better. Actually. it often exacerbates problems that already exist.</p>



<p>Secondly, marriage is often treated as the ‘end goal’ of a relationship. In fact, there&#8217;s so much more that happens <em>after </em>the wedding &#8211; maybe kids, career growth, retirement etc. Life brings with it an array of joys and challenges, whether there’s a ring on your finger or not. Having a committed partner by your side can help in facing those life challenges better.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Relationships should always stay the same</strong></h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

				</div>

	</div>
	


<p>Isn’t it human nature to grow and evolve? Both you and your partner are bound to change as the years roll by. To keep up, a healthy relationship will grow and adapt as well. Your honeymoon phase will not last forever, but that’s not a bad thing.</p>



<p>Arguments are sometimes looked at as ‘failures’ in relationships; constructive disagreements can be a healthier form of communication. During a disagreement, let go of trying to prove ‘I’m right’ and attempt to learn something new about your partner. Ultimately, this strengthens relationships.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Being in love, in a relationship will make you happy</strong></h2>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/9640586682907927/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/9640586682907927/</a>



<p>Being in a relationship makes life more colorful and adds a certain glow to it. But your general state of happiness ultimately lies in your own hands. Giving someone else the responsibility to make you happy is really a big ask. If you’re dependent on being in a relationship to be happy, you will likely fall into traps of insecurity and jealousy. Which, in turn, puts a strain on your relationship.</p>

<p>No matter who we are or where we are in life, it’s important to remember that in a healthy relationship, there’s no winning or losing. Love is all about connecting with someone else. Sometimes these connections fade but that doesn’t lessen its value. There are always learnings and memories to hold on to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whether you&#8217;re already in a long-distance relationship and currently dating someone or single and swiping away on dating apps, having to self isolate thanks to the pandemic has been especially tricky for our love lives. While still respecting the safe at home order, it is only natural to feel a little antsy to not to be able to go out and see people. Well, this is where one has to start thinking of virtual date ideas.</p>



<p>We are sure the bars and the parks miss you, but just because you can’t go out on outdoor dates and see each other in person, doesn’t mean you can’t build relationships from the comfort of your house.</p>



<p>This could also be the perfect time to not only get to know someone on a deeper level but also introspect and further invest in your existing relationships.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick list of some fun activities you can do with someone when you’re not physically in the same space. A lot of these things could also be done with your friends and family; they don&#8217;t have to be specific to romantic or sexual partners.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Virtual date ideas for gamers! </h2>



<p>There are so many different kinds of games out there, both competitive and cooperative. Be it easy breezy and accessible fun mobile games or serious sit-down PC / console gaming, the possibilities are endless!</p>



<p>A lot of games that you play online together don&#8217;t involve speaking to each other, so a video call is a good way to carry on communicating whilst you’re playing the game.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse">Make it more fun by adding your own twists to it, such as the person who wins a game gets to ask the other person a challenging question or give them a dare.</pre>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Virtual date ideas for your inner nerd!</h2>



<p>Make a book club! Read a book together and then organize a time to have a video call to discuss the said book. Consuming the same things together and discussing them is a great way to connect with your partner. Reading to each other is also a great virtual date because it can inspire thoughtful conversations.</p>



<p>You can experiment with a book, an article, or even a podcast episode! Taking an online personality test or relationship quizzes together is not only entertaining, but the results could be very amusing too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Netflix and….party?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.netflixparty.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix Party</a> (or Teleparty) is a chrome extension that allows you to watch content simultaneously while texting on the little chat box that appears.</p>



<p>And it is always a good idea to either have an audio or a video call or even plain texting to make sure its a conjoint experience.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Groovy virtual date ideas!</h2>



<p>This one’s for all the music lovers out there &#8211; Create a joint playlist!</p>



<p>You can create private playlists that you both have access to, can add songs to, and listen to at the same time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Get back to the classics</h2>



<p>Cooking and eating dinner together over video calls and the quintessential dinner dates never gets old. To spice things up, you can also decide to buy the same ingredients and plan what you’re going to cook. You could also get adventurous and order a surprise meal for each other.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><strong>Warning:</strong> Not for picky eaters.</pre>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Sing your sorrows away…</h2>



<p>Karaoke night is our favorite! Get some tunes up on YouTube, put your video call on, have a few drinks, and burst into song! Also, a good day to put on your favorite concert outfit and dance your heart out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Pop open a bottle!</h2>



<p>Wine nights are a must if you&#8217;re going to try out one of these virtual date ideas. Sorry, we did not make the rules. Hop onto Zoom or FaceTime and pour a glass of wine and talk about anything and everything. Don’t be afraid to get a little tipsy for a little wine helps to loosen up the conversation like nothing else can.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Last but definitely not least, make sure to treat it like a real date! Just because you’re alone in your room doesn’t make it any less of a date. Dress up in something that makes you feel confident and don&#8217;t forget to have fun y&#8217;all!</p>



<p>(If nothing else you&#8217;ll have some very interesting stories to tell your grandchildren!)</p>
