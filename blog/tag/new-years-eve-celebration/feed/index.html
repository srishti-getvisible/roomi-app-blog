										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>New Year’s Eve is a time when many people want to have fun, let their hair down and celebrate with friends and family. But as we recover from the pandemic that swept through our streets this year, it’s a good idea to remain cautious. New variants of the Covid-19 virus are still being observed in several parts of the world. For some of us, this will mean hosting our festive celebrations entirely online. However, for those of us who’ve been vaccinated, there are also some brilliant in-person New Year’s Eve party ideas that are both safe and fun.</p>

<p>So, pull out your New Year’s decorations and send the e-invites. Whether you host your parties online or offline, there are plenty of ways to celebrate with your loved ones and give them your best wishes for the coming year. We have some brilliant New Year’s Eve party ideas in store for you to fill your celebrations with joy and laughter.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="glow-up-your-apartment-with-new-year-s-decorations">Glow up your apartment with New Year’s Decorations</h2>



<p>Blow up the balloons and hang up the fairy lights by all means. But there are so many New Year’s Eve party ideas for decor to make the occasion Instagrammable! Here are some fun ways to jazz up your space and welcome 2022.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-have-an-nye-theme">1. Have an NYE theme</h3>



<p>Working around a theme can make your decorations unique and quirky. You can work with a color palette and add more accessories to highlight the theme. You can also choose to make it glamorous or minimalistic to fit your style. Make your own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHjE7pSxXk0">disco ball</a> for a vibrant disco-themed party. A Roaring Twenties party theme will also call for lots of glitters! Alternatively, you could fast forward to a futuristic setting and add bold neon signs. Don’t forget the props and costumes to match!</p>

<p>If too much bling is not your thing, you may want to go for a more elegant NYE aesthetic. Try Winter Wonderland style decor with paper-cut snowflakes and pine cones on a white backdrop. You could also try a <a href="https://liagriffith.com/our-boho-glam-new-years-eve-party/?sscid=c1k5_kulwn">bohemian theme</a> for a warm and welcoming gathering. Arrange a low, comfortable seating area and decorate the space with artificial feathers, printed sheets, and some gold accents. A pajama party or movie marathon session will also work perfectly with simple New Year’s decorations.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-create-a-countdown-wall">2. Create a countdown wall</h3>



<p>The countdown to the coming year is the most awaited part of any New Year’s Eve party. A countdown wall can also make for an excellent photo opportunity. <a href="https://thehousethatlarsbuilt.com/2017/12/countdown-to-midnight-backdrop.html/">Create a wall art</a> clock with bold arrow hands and have fun posing with friends in the lead up to midnight. Use your art and craft skills to make some cardboard cutouts and stick them up. Or else, you can use balloons to stick your numbers on and put them up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-photo-backdrop">3. Photo backdrop</h3>



<p>If not a countdown wall, you could create a festive photo backdrop to snap some memorable moments. You can make a simple fringe curtain or spruce up a wall with gold balloons for glamorous parties. A curtain made of feathers and beads will work beautifully for a bohemian theme. And don’t forget the photo props for some extra fun!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-best-new-year-games"><strong>What are the best New Year games?</strong></h2>



<p>Whether you do a pajama party or a dance fest, New Year&#8217;s games can be the best way to break the ice in an intimate party hosted online or offline. Here are some exciting New Year’s Eve party ideas for games that you must try!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="nye-charades">NYE Charades</h3>



<p>The classic game of charades is ideal for filling the room with laughter. There are multiple themes to choose from, so you can opt for something that most people in the room are familiar with. Movie names are often a popular choice! Write the names on tiny slips of paper and divide everyone into two groups. Every person will come up once to pick a slip and act out the theme without speaking. Their team members then have to guess the right name to score a point.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="card-games-for-new-year-celebrations">Card Games for New Year Celebrations</h3>



<p>Interesting card games can be the best way to socialize at a party and get to know everyone. Fill-in-the-blanks games like Cards against Humanity can pull out fun anecdotes and the best jokes to laugh out loud. You could also organize a poker tournament to fill the room with competitive energy or arrange printables for prompt games recapping the year’s highlights.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="guessing-the-resolutions">Guessing the Resolutions</h3>



<p>Resolutions are one of the most popular New Year topics, so why not make a fun game out of them? You can ask everyone to write their resolutions on a slip of paper and put them in a box. You can then pick them out and guess who the resolution belongs to. Alternatively, try Two Resolutions and A Lie to make the game more interesting.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="virtual-scenario-games">Virtual scenario games</h3>



<p>If you’re hosting an NYE party online, virtual games can be the best of New Year’s Eve party ideas to get started with the fun. <a href="https://teambuilding.com/blog/virtual-murder-mystery" class="broken_link">Murder mystery</a> may sound like a subject for Halloween but it can be super fun with an online group. Plus, there are all kinds of themes to choose from. You can also go play the good old Bingo and even create your own <a href="https://teambuilding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/virtual-new-years-bingo.jpg" class="broken_link">templates with interesting captions</a>. Trivia games, Two Truths And a Lie, and guessing resolutions, are also perfect for virtual settings.</p>

<p>Okay, this year is FINALLY coming to an end, and aren’t we all grateful for it? So much of this crazy year has been a blur (we might have had a super important election in there at some point?) but most of us have never been more excited to say bye-bye to a year than this one. While this year has been pretty terrible overall, that does not mean we can’t celebrate New Year&#8217;s Eve with a bang. In fact, that’s actually more of a reason to celebrate even harder this year.</p>



<p>But the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic</a> isn’t over yet, so let’s celebrate this New Year’s Eve the way we’ve spent the majority of this year &#8211; camped in our cozy homes with some booze and delish meals.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/8-fun-virtual-activities-to-celebrate-2021-roomi-2/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Related : Fun Virtual Activities To Celebrate The Beginning Of 2021 At Home </a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Spice up your decor</h2>



<p>A New Year’s Eve party isn’t really a party if there aren’t any decorations! The day demands elaborate decor to get everyone in the mood. Bring out those Tik Tok LED lights and your Christmas candles. Get 2021 glasses, and hats and balloons and whatever else that strikes your fancy. You can even pick a wall in your living room and turn it into a DIY photo station. Believe me, you will want pictures from this unique year. So, get out your craft box, you’re going to need it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theme party</h2>



<p>It’s pretty common for NYE parties to have a theme, it’s a fun way to bond with your friends and get creative with your clothes. This year doesn’t have to be any different! There’s so many themes to choose from- maybe you want to have a 1920s theme party, or a Tiger King theme party (remember that phase of the pandemic? Haha, fun times&#8230;) The choice is yours, but maybe pick a theme where everyone gets to wear wigs, because.. Well, because it’s really fun and all of us deserve to have some fun on New Year’s.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Game night!</h2>



<p>This is probably one of the few years where you are encouraged to have small gatherings, so take advantage of that. A small party is the perfect way to have a game night. Can you even remember the last time you had a game night with your friends? <em>Exactly.</em> Pull out your board games (or card games, whatever you prefer) and get ready for the funnest night you’ve had all year. Booze plus friends plus board games always equal an interesting time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">BOOZE!</h2>



<p>One final drink before we launch into Dry January? Many adults will attest to the fact that booze helped most of us get through this year with some sanity still intact. So, just as an ode to this year, pay extra attention to the booze that you serve. Maybe you can come up with a signature cocktail for the party to commemorate 2020. It’s really fun to pretend to be a bartender every once in a while, and this is the perfect opportunity. Get out your jigger and your shaker and get to work on your personalized cocktail&#8230; Maybe watch a few YouTube videos first, and don&#8217;t go overboard, Roomis!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A delicious meal</h2>



<p>A party needs good food. Period. You cannot throw a NYE party without having a thorough plan about what you’re going to serve your guests. You don’t have to go broke trying to impress your friends, but you do need to serve food that is delicious. Here’s the thing: most people don’t want to have a sit-down dinner on New Year’s Eve. Most people want some casual snacks that they can nibble on throughout the evening.</p>



<p>Some great options you can consider are cheese and crackers, chicken wings, chips, samosas &#8211; things that you can easily eat without making a mess. You don&#8217;t even have to cook. Get some take-out from your favorite local Chinese place and get the party started!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dance Dance Revolution</h2>



<p>Listen, no New Year’s Party is totally complete without everyone dancing by the end of it- the situation demands it. Of course, I’m not saying hire the actual Dance Dance Revolution game (although if you can, that will be AWESOME), but make some space for people to dance at the end of the night. You can also have the New Year countdown here. It’s really special to have every one in one place to ring in the new year. So move some furniture around and make your own temporary dance floor!</p>
