<p>The search for good movies on Netflix can be a daunting task. It&#8217;s especially a struggle when your partner or Roomi have to agree on something. You may spend forever arguing about the dishes or cleaning, but we&#8217;ve got your back on what to watch on Netflix next. Our recommendations for the top Netflix movies of 2020 will solve all your troubles. Don&#8217;t worry, we googled the IMDb rating already.</p>



<p>In conclusion, spend less time arguing and more time chilling in front of the TV with Roomi&#8217;s picks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movies on Netflix to watch #1: Icarus</h2>



<p>Genre: Documentary/Thriller</p>



<p>IMDB Rating: 7.8/10</p>



<p>Icarus is a dope sports documentary film (<em>no seriously, it&#8217;s about doping</em>) on Netflix directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Fogel" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bryan Fogel</a>. The documentary sets out to uncover the truth about the usage of drugs in the sports industry. It hits a gold mine when Bryan Fogel stumbles upon Russia&#8217;s state-sponsored doping program. Consequently dirty urine, unexplained deaths, and Olympic gold are all part of the exposure of the biggest scandal in sports history.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movies on Netflix to watch #2:365 DNI (365 Days)</h2>



<p>Genre: Romance/Drama/Erotica</p>



<p>IMDB Rating: 3.3/10 <em>(Don&#8217;t go solely on this rating, this one of the most-streamed movies on Netflix)</em></p>



<p>The world couldn&#8217;t get enough of the Fifty Shades Trilogy and their absurd storylines, so the directors in Poland thought &#8211; <em>&#8220;hey why not give the world what it wants &#8211; EROTICA!&#8221;</em> Therefore, this erotic movie revolves around Stockholm syndrome, incredibly steamy scenes, and seriously questionable behavior from the protagonists. Don&#8217;t watch this movie expecting a great storyline but watch it for the steamy chemistry between the leads. So the question prevails- <em>are you gonna watch it baby gurl?</em></p>



<p>Fun fact: 365 DNI is one of the most-watched movies on Netflix in 2020.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movies on Netflix to watch #3: I Lost My Body</h2>



<p>Genre: Animation/Fantasy</p>



<p>IMDB Rating: 7.6/10</p>



<p>Guided by the memories of a boy named Naoufel and his love for Gabrielle, a severed hand sets out to reunite with its lost body. To illustrate, the movie paints a beautiful picture of reunion. It is the story of a hand that scrambles through the serene and sometimes cruel pitfalls of Paris. Therefore, it is a MUST WATCH!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movies on Netflix to watch #4: Dolemite Is My Name</h2>



<p>Genre: Drama/Comedy</p>



<p>IMDB Rating: 7.3/10</p>



<p>This Netflix original comedy film is thoroughly entertaining and very inspiring in many ways. Specifically, it is based on the true story of Rudy Ray Moore, a comedian who wanted his dream character &#8220;Dolemite&#8221; to be viewed by millions. Therefore, he aimed to achieve his goals by writing, producing, and starring in his own extremely low-budget film. Eddie Murphy takes the cake with his fantastic performance and witty demeanor.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movies on Netflix to watch #5: The Irishman</h2>



<p>Genre: Crime/drama</p>



<p>Rotten Tomatoes Rating: 7.9/10</p>



<p>Ahh, The Irishman is a straight-up jackpot &#8211; an excellent director and a dream cast! Martin Scorsese&#8217;s epic creation encapsulates the life of a truck driver Frank Sheeran who climbs the crime ladder to become one of the top hitmen. Basically, the 3.5-hour runtime on The Irishman flies by as it moves from an entertaining mob story plot to realization and speculations. The Irishman is not just another Scorsese &#8220;mob movie&#8221;;  To conclude, it&#8217;s profound and explores the realms of crime and life attached to it.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movies on Netflix to watch #6: Uncut Gems</h2>



<p>Genre: Crime/thriller</p>



<p>IMDB Rating: 7.4/10</p>



<p>IMO, Uncut Gems is by far the best Adam Sandler performance Hollywood has seen. To illustrate, the thriller is played by a Jewish jeweler and a gambling addict in NY City&#8217;s Diamond District, who makes a high-stake bet that could make or break him. The film is tense and will have you at the edge of your seat from the minute it starts till the end. Truly, it is an exhilarating piece of work directed by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1EJFC_enIN889IN889&amp;q=Josh+Safdie&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LVT9c3NEzPMTMqSSnJVeLSz9U3sCyuzCmK1xLLTrbST8vMyQUTVimZRanJJflFi1i5vfKLMxSCE9NSMlN3sDICACf8yrBGAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiGgJaR4JbrAhUW_XMBHbSHBkEQmxMoATA1egQIFhAD" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Safdie</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1EJFC_enIN889IN889&amp;q=Benny+Safdie&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LVT9c3NEzPMTMqSSnJVeLSz9U3sCyuzCkq0hLLTrbST8vMyQUTVimZRanJJflFi1h5nFLz8ioVghPTUjJTd7AyAgBDUyYhRwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiGgJaR4JbrAhUW_XMBHbSHBkEQmxMoAjA1egQIFhAE" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benny Safdie</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movies on Netflix to watch #7: Okja</h2>



<p>Genre: Adventure/Drama</p>



<p>IMDB Rating: 7.3/10</p>



<p>From Korean director Bong Joon-ho (<em>Parasite</em>), this Netflix original follows the journey of a young girl and her companion Okja. Basically, it all starts when the Mirando Corporation kidnaps Okja and transports her to New York as a prototype for their invention of meat, which leaves a minimal carbon footprint. Subsequently, Mija, the young girl, sets off on an adventure across the world to save her best friend. </p>



<p>Finally, she crosses paths with consumers and protestors who each have their own agendas. The movie paints the harsh reality of the livestock industry, cruelty, and hardcore consumerism. All animal lovers watch this movie with a box of tissues!</p>
