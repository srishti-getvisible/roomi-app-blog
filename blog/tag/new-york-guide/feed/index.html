So, if you liked seeing Barney Stinson and friends having quality time at their &#8216;pub&#8217;, then here are some pubs in NYC that may be a good fit for you.</p>

<p>Dubbed by its official website as &#8216;Staten Island&#8217;s Popular Meetings Place&#8217;, Joyce&#8217;s Tavern is a local favorite. You&#8217;ll find many events here such as live music bands, Reverse Happy Hour, Country Night Thursdays, Spring and Summer BOGO, and much more. Just recently, they organized a &#8216;Free Britney&#8217; Party in support of Britney Spears. With a recently opened back patio deck, you can enjoy your meal below the NYC sky.</p>

<p>Every day is St. Paddy&#8217;s Day in Flanagan&#8217;s Tavern. This is a fully-fledged Irish-themed bar, which How I Met Your Mother fans may love. This is also great for sports lovers, as they screen games every Sunday while serving great food and drinks. Live music entertainment is also on offer, so what are you waiting for?</p>

<p>Not many bars in NYC are located close to the Staten Island Ferry, which is why this is one of the coolest New York pubs. They offer great service and beer, and even have a jukebox! Events like Martini Madness, Happy Hour, and Karaoke night will be sure to spice up your night.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When in NYC, you&#8217;ve got to dress like a New Yorker! If you&#8217;re planning a trip to visit New York over the Holiday Season, gurl &#8211; bundle up! New York&#8217;s infamous winter chill can literally quote, unquote,&nbsp;<em>freeze you</em>&nbsp;if you&#8217;re not packing mindfully. Especially for someone who&#8217;s coming from a place where it doesn&#8217;t snow. Personally, I feel winter is like the best time to visit NYC! Why? Because NYC Christmas is like no other, and everyone should witness it at least once in their lifetime. However, if you&#8217;re not prepared for the cold, you will be unable to experience its true beauty. So without further ado, here&#8217;s a survival guide with NYC winter essentials to prep you for the sweater weather.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Open your suitcase and add the following NYC Winter essentials!</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Warmers</h3>



<p>Layering is key! Especially if you want to survive the NYC winter! However, layering can be quite difficult if your sweaters are all thick &amp; heavily knit. I mean the last thing you want to do is end up looking like a fine lookin&#8217; pumpkin on your 2021 vacation. Unless that&#8217;s the look you&#8217;re going for. So do this instead &#8211; invest in good quality warmers. Not only do they keep you super snug, but you can also slide them under your favorite outfits with ease.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Winter Jacket</h3>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Comfortable sneakers</h4>



<p>Ask any New Yorker what their favorite mode of transport is, and they will say &#8216;walking&#8217;! No, seriously, that &amp; the subway. I know that Carrie Bradshaw had us believe that we could walk anywhere in the six-inch heels. But it&#8217;s not a practical choice. So you want to pack sneakers that allow you to stay comfy around the clock.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">NYC Winter Essentials: Boots</h4>



<p>No winter survival guide is complete without the staple winter boots. You need a functional pair that&#8217;s waterproof &amp; comfortable. Please skip bringing any cutesy ballerinas, heels, or fancy suede footwear! They will end up getting wet &amp; dirty in the snow, leaving you to fend for yourself barefoot.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. A comfortable bag</h3>



<p>To enjoy NYC for all its beauty &amp; traveling within the city you need a bag to add all your travel essentials. New York is an expensive city, so you want to carry things that don&#8217;t let you exceed your budget and helps you explore the city comfortably. I personally like to carry a backpack that can accommodate my camera and other NYC winter essentials like:</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Water bottle</h4>



<p>Stay hydrated on the go with a leak-proof water bottle. Additionally, I also like to carry an insulated water bottle for my caffeine fix. It helps me save on the crazy coffee charges that can go anywhere between $5 to $20.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Lip Balm</h4>



<p>Cold winters and chapped lips are like that cringe couple that loves to PDA. It&#8217;s hard to break &#8217;em up unless you have a lip balm that believes in third-wheeling like a boss.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Portable Charger</h4>



<p>Don&#8217;t you hate it when you see a beautiful scene, and before you can capture it, your battery dies. This honestly has happened to me(even as a local) way more than I&#8217;d like to accept. Anywho, as a traveler, you need it more than anyone &#8211; <strong>for beautiful snaps + google maps</strong>. There&#8217;s nothing worse than getting lost in a new city w/o a map.

<p>So, your hard work has finally paid off- you’re going to be living in New York in the fall! Your dream of studying in the Big Apple has come true! We’re sure it wasn’t easy, but you did it! Student life in NYC is a magical experience- we can only imagine what getting that acceptance letter felt like! But as exciting as all of this is, there’s probably something else on your mind as well. Something that’s a bit more troubling- the cost of living in NYC as an international student. It is after all one of the most <a href="https://www.timeout.com/news/revealed-the-most-expensive-cities-in-the-world-right-now-112520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive cities </a>in the world to live in. Well, don’t you worry because Roomi can be your very own personal New York guide!</p>

<p>We know the idea of living in a foreign country for the first time can be very daunting. So, to make the transition a little easier for you, we’ve broken down all the costs that you should expect to encounter when you come to live in the city. So, let’s dive right in, shall we?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the cost of living in NYC for an international student?</h2>



<p>It’s no secret that the cost of living in NYC is extremely high. I mean, there’s enough jokes about it already. So, we’ll spare you the trite remarks. But, don’t worry, there is some good news here. If you’re a student living in New York, things will probably be relatively cheaper for you. <em>Relatively</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Remember, international students in NYC have to pay a set minimum cost of attendance (CoA)</strong>. Different schools can have wildly different CoAs, depending on your course and whether it’s a public or a private university. You need to prove that you can at least cover the CoA amount to secure your visa. But this is just the minimum cost of attendance, you will have to prepare for other costs as well.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of concessions available for students all over the city that you can take advantage of. And as your New York guide, we’ll get to that in a minute. But before we do, let’s take a second to look at the basic costs that you need to be prepared for before you begin your life in NYC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Want to find roommates and ways to save up on costs as an international student? We&#8217;ve got your back!</h3>

<p>To make it easier, here are the average costs that a student will encounter while living in NYC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Average cost of living for students in NYC</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Particulars</td><td>Average Cost </td></tr><tr><td>Rent</td><td><a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/New-York" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3,089.42/ month</a></td></tr><tr><td>Travelling</td><td><a href="https://new.mta.info/fares#30day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$127/ month</a></td></tr><tr><td>Food</td><td><a href="https://livingwage.mit.edu/states/36" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3,477/ month</a></td></tr><tr><td>Utilities</td><td>$63.59/ month</td></tr><tr><td>Health Insurance</td><td><a href="https://www.internationalstudentinsurance.com/explained/international-student-health-insurance.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100/ month</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Yes, we know it’s a bit steep. But these are just an average of all the costs. If you budget correctly, you will be paying much lower than the above mentioned costs. Lucky for you, there are quite a ways to save money while living in New York. So, read on!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to afford living in NYC?</h2>



<p>Now that you have a fair idea of all the different costs of living in NYC, we can show you how you can afford them!</p>



<p>For starters, if you have the option, choose on-campus housing! It is the easiest way to save money on lodging. Think about it- you won’t have to worry about furniture, or monthly rent or even utilities! As a student, you only need to pay the housing fees at the beginning of the year, and then you can pretty much forget about it!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>And it’s not just that! By living on-campus, you save on food as well! Colleges and Universities have meal plan options for its students that cost a fraction of what meals would cost otherwise! Not to mention, living on-campus is an experience unto itself and you really shouldn’t miss out on it. Roomi recommends trying it out at least once in your college life, even if you can afford the alternative!</p>



<p>If living on campus is not an option, check out this <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/a-first-time-renters-brilliant-guide-to-living-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">helpful guide</a> for first-time renters in NYC!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to live life to the fullest in NYC!</h2>



<p>Well, now that the boring technical part is over, we can concentrate on the fun part of living in New York! As your New York guide, it is our duty to tell you all the fun things you can do in the city <em>for free</em>!</p>



<p>This list about living in NYC wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the Museum of Modern Art. Admission is free for all visitors on Friday evenings from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. And on other days students get a discount as well! While we’re on the topic of museums, you also need to check out The Metropolitan Museum of Art! For New York State residents and NY, NJ, and CT students, the amount you pay is up to you! (So, basically, free!).</p>



<p>You can also take the Staten Island ferry (for free), have a picnic in Central Park, explore Chelsea Market, wander around the Brooklyn Botanical garden and SO MUCH MORE!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Does <em>living in NYC</em> and <em>zero waste living</em> really go hand in hand? Well, yes.</p>



<p>There are New Yorkers who have done and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zerowastehome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documented it. Meet Béa Johnson</a>. Her family of four generates only a small jar of waste each year. I know, we can&#8217;t believe it either. If this gets a little part of you excited to try it out too in your shared apartment, then you’re in the right place. Read on for a realistic New York guide to start your zero waste journey.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“Refuse what you do not need; reduce what you do need; reuse what you consume; recycle what you cannot refuse, reduce, or reuse; and rot (compost) the rest.” </em></p><cite><em>Bea Johnson on zero waste living in NYC</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>The key is to start slow and continue steadily. Take it a step at a time rather than trying to do zero waste life at once. The ultimate aim is a lifestyle that is both sustainable and comfortable to live. If you find it inconvenient, you are unlikely to stick to it in the long term.</p>

<p>Carrying your own bag is a great start. The next step is being mindful about what you buy. Try bulk buying, so there’s no plastic packaging. Farmer’s markets often have products available that aren’t wrapped in plastic. Living in NYC also gives you access to some zero-waste stores, which makes sustainable shopping more straightforward.</p>



<p>Packaging takes up a lot of room in our waste-paper bins. So just by choosing products sold loose or with reusable packaging, you make a big difference!</p>



<p>Once you successfully practice zero waste shopping with your groceries, you can branch out. There&#8217;s a New York guide for almost everything, so it would be easy to find the right stores for sustainable shopping. Think clothes, cosmetics, and even vehicles.</p>

<p>Living in NYC is turning eco-friendly. The city has committed to reducing overall landfill waste by 2030. We have the largest composting program in the country, open to over 3.5 m residents.</p>



<p>The city has also partnered with non-profit organizations to redistribute pre-loved and reusable items. Instead of ending up in a landfill, second-hand products reach those in need through <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/donate/index.shtml" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">donateNYC</a> or <a href="https://www.housingworks.org/donate" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Housing Works</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Alternatively, you can compost at home for your plant babies! Composting is easy-peasy and can be done in any space. Even in a shared apartment or a condo. Trust us- your plants will thank you for it!

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enjoy <em>delicious</em> zero-waste meals</h2>

<p>There’s a common misconception that those who practice sustainability are somehow ‘missing out’ on common experiences enjoyed by others. This may have been true to some extent at the beginning of the movement but no longer. With more and more people seeing the value of a mindful, sustainable lifestyle, even restaurants in the city are looking toward zero-waste functioning. So, when it’s safe to go out again, you can take a break from your shared apartment (finally!) and enjoy a meal out without compromising your chosen lifestyle.</p>

<p>As we said at the beginning of this handy zero waste New York guide, this is just a practical place to begin. There’s a lot more you can do. Everyone&#8217;s zero waste journey looks different.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re sure once you get used to thinking about the sustainability of your habits, you&#8217;ll automatically be more mindful of your choices. Good luck to you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Well, congratulations are in order, you just signed the lease to your first New York apartment! Your dream of living in NYC has finally come true! After all that day-dreaming, hard work, and lots of saving- you finally have the key, literally, to your dream! But since this is New York you’re probably going to have to share an apartment with some stranger you met 20 minutes ago. But let’s not ponder over that! After all, you’re living in NYC, the greatest city in the world!</p>



<p>But before you go falling in love with the city, there are some things you need to keep in mind as a first-time renter, especially when you share an apartment. And we are here to help you with that. Consider us your New York guide who will show you all about making smart choices and investments so can have the perfect NYC life that you always dreamed of!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Living in NYC- Where do I begin?</h2>



<p>We get that living in NYC is your dream, even if it means that you have to share an apartment. But before you go signing anything, you should make sure you’ve done thorough research about what neighborhood you want to live in. And this research will have to be a little deeper than just re-watching Friends for the 100th time. Every neighborhood in the city is a world in itself- you need to find a neighborhood that suits your personality.</p>

				</div>

	</div>
	


<p>Of course, since we are your New York guide we will help you understand the personality of each neighborhood a little better. Here is a wonderful page to <a href="https://www.platinumpropertiesnyc.com/neighborhoods" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">find out more about each neighborhood in New York</a>. Once you get through the hard task of finding a neighborhood that suits your personality (and your budget), everything else will become easy. Even the fact that you have to share an apartment.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Roomi Tip</strong>&#8211; Most buildings demand that your annual income should be at least 40 times the monthly rent. So, prepare yourself for the possibility of having more than one roommate.</p></blockquote>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Look into short-term rentals</h2>



<p>We would not be a good New York guide if we didn’t tell you to at least consider looking into short-term rentals. A short-term rental is basically any place that you will stay for a couple of months just to see what it’s like living in NYC. This is a great way to experience living in a neighborhood of your choice and see if it really fits you. You can also assess who you want to share an apartment with during this stay. We know, the idea of a short lease can be scary for people, after all, you don’t want to keep apartment hunting every two months. But this is an option for first-time renters.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Roomi tip:</strong> You can use google for short-term rentals in New York, but to get the real picture, we suggest getting in touch with a real estate agent.</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get your paperwork in order!</h2>



<p>Okay, picture this- you have found the perfect apartment- it’s got everything you want- a big window, spacious kitchen and a bedroom. You’ve even found the perfect person to share an apartment with. But wait, you don’t have any of your paperwork in order. And just like that, all your dreams of living in NYC have gone down the drain. Don’t be a fool, listen to your New York guide and get your paperwork together. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nyrentownsell.com/blog/list-of-document-required-to-rent-an-apartment-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here is a list of paperwork you will need</a> to be able to rent an apartment and start living in NYC!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know your rights</h2>



<p>As a first-time renter, you are the most vulnerable to being taken advantage of by your landlords. And as your trusted New York guides, we cannot let that happen. It is always good to know what your rights are, but especially so if you’re dealing with NYC real estate. Trust me, living in New York City is not child’s play. As tenants, you and the person you share an apartment with need to know what you can demand from your landlords and what are the services that need to be provided to you. Check out what your <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/renter/tenant-rights.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">rights as a tenant are here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pace yourself</h2>



<p>Now that you’ve finally moved into your apartment, you’re probably really excited to decorate! After all, this is the most fun part of moving in the first place. Not to mention, this can be a great bonding exercise to do with whoever you share an apartment with. But you should learn to pace yourself. Don’t buy stuff in bulk and put yourself in debt. Instead, buy over time and let your decor reflect the kind of life you&#8217;re living in NYC.</p>

<p>With that, your New York guide will take your leave and let you enjoy your new apartment in peace! See you next time!</p>

<p>If Manhattan is XS and Brooklyn M, then <em>Queens is XL.</em> Notably, in all departments. An extra-large palate of food, diversity, and also <em>literally in size!</em> Queens is the largest and the most diverse of all the five boroughs in New York. The borough encapsulates a beautiful medley of cultures and experiences, which is a result of residents from far lands calling Queens their home.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p>The borough is a favorite among nature lovers, history fanatics, sports fans, and modern-art aficionados. If you&#8217;re someone who&#8217;s living in NYC, you can&#8217;t deny seeing the large Pepsi-Cola sign that draws many influencers and tourists from around the world. It&#8217;s quite cute!</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Want a spot you can enjoy art and a picnic at the same time? Head to&nbsp;<a href="https://socratessculpturepark.org/">The Socrates Sculptural Park</a>, an outdoor space where sculptors showcase their best work in 3D. When it&#8217;s time to hop back on the tour and explore more of Queens, you can tap on your New York Guide&#8217;s shoulder – that&#8217;s me! Some other cool places to visit are the Noguchi Museum and the famous modern art museum MoMA PS1.</p>



<p>If you love being in or next to water, make sure to visit the Rockaway beach that allows surfers (in summers). The beach has breweries and great food to relish while checking out the majestic views. Oh s<em>o pretty!</em></p>



<p>As your New York Guide, here are my top recommendations when visiting Queens:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The Unisphere, Corona Park</li><li>Ferry ports</li><li>New York State Pavillion – It&#8217;s surrounded by beautiful Cherry blossoms in spring, and is a real sight to behold</li><li>Fort Tildon &#8211; For people who love to visit unconventional spots while traveling. An adventurous trip for people living in NYC too!</li><li>Museum of the Moving Image</li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.louisarmstronghouse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Louis Armstrong House Museum</a></li></ol>

<p>The beautiful island is only a scenic ferry ride away. As your New York Guide, I must express how much I personally love Staten Island. It&#8217;s the greenest borough; a magical Narnia escape within the city (minus the white witch, which at this point is probably the pandemic). Staten Island offers the most stunning views, beaches, immersive Maritime history, and even a fully preserved colonial village. Hop on folks, we are taking the ferry!</p>

<p>As someone who&#8217;s not acquainted with&nbsp;living in NYC, you may not realize the city has more to offer than Manhattan and Brooklyn alone. New York is a city rich in history and heritage with each Borough offering a unique flavor. So what exactly is a &#8216;borough&#8217;?

<p>Home to music and baseball lovers. This borough encapsulates a rich history and the inception of two of the most cherished and loved experiences in the world today – Hip Hop and Team Yankees! The&nbsp;**Bronx once homed legends and hip hop masters like Grandmaster Flash from Morrisania, DJ Afrika Bambaataa from Bronx River Houses, DJ Kool Herc from the Sedgwick Avenue. These artists and many others played an instrumental role (quite literally) in making the hip hop genre what it is today.</p>

<p>We are now at the most iconic (and most expensive) borough of New York. For instance, the feel and the whimsical magic of skyscrapers, blinding city lights, and famous movie sites will leave you in awe of this borough. Manhattan, most commonly referred to as &#8216;the city&#8217;, is also the business heartland of the USA.</p>



<p>If you look back at NYC&#8217;s history, some of the most crucial decisions were made in this borough. Moreover, the tall, untouchable peak of the Empire State Building continues to bring many dreamers to the city that never sleeps. Whether you&#8217;re a tourist or someone&nbsp;living in NYC, a visit to Times Square is a must. Especially at night, when the whole city seems to come alive as the billboards light up the central crossing and yellow taxis rush to get people where they need to go.</p>



<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong>&nbsp;Broadway was born in Manhattan!</p>



<p>Our top recommendation as your New York Guide while visiting Manhattan are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Empire State Building</li>



<li>Times Square</li>



<li>Wall Street</li>



<li>Broadway</li>



<li>Grand Central Terminal</li>



<li>Central Park</li>



<li>The High Line</li>



<li>Chelsea Market</li>
</ul>

<p>A haven for history buffs and hipsters, Brooklyn has something for everyone. While Manhattan is the epicenter of New York, Brooklyn is an epicenter for people living in NYC. This populous borough draws people in with live music, pro sports, rich heritage, delicious food, majestic places to unwind like Pebble beach, and the infamous Coney Island.</p>



<p>Brooklyn was once an independent city until it merged with NYC in 1898. Today, the borough retains its own artsy style, immigrant history, and multi-ethnic culture. As your New York Guide, allow us to add how awesome and diverse Brooklyn&#8217;s palate is. Not only do they have famous cheesecakes at Junior, they also have a large selection of vegan and kosher options – Brooklyn is literalllly every foodie&#8217;s dream come true.</p>



<p>Here are our top recommendations to visit as a tourist or even as someone who&#8217;s living in NYC:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Brooklyn Bridge</li>



<li>Prospect Park</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>New York City is a prime destination for tourism and living. The social life, career opportunities and bragging rights can’t be beat! But the first year after moving to NYC can be really rough, especially if you move here without doing a little homework first or have friends in the city to turn to for advice. After all, there isn&#8217;t an NYC 101 class you can take.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before moving to NYC I wished I knew that making and keeping friends would not be easy. I wish I knew that getting and staying employed would not be easy. But most of all I wish I knew that someone would have told me ahead of time that Joe&#8217;s Pizza is the best damn pizza in the city.”</span></i></p><cite>Varun Ramprasad, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</cite></blockquote>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the team at Roomi has created a list of super helpful things to know before moving to NYC with real, honest and handy tips from Roomi customers who already made the big move. Read up and be ready for everything NYC has to offer with these tips and tricks to save money, have fun, and stay sane in one of the coolest places on Earth.</span></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before I moved to NYC I wished I knew that the dating scene can be exhausting due to all the options!”</span></i></p><cite>Fausto Matta, Baltimore, MD</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>1. If you&#8217;re moving to NYC</b>, you should know the<b> rent is insane.</b></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before I moved to NYC I wished I knew that Manhattan rental prices and spaces weren&#8217;t the average and weren&#8217;t the only option. Now I live in a Brooklyn apartment double (maybe even triple) the size that costs $300 less per month. Face palm.”</span></i></p><cite>Sibabalwe Mona, Johannesburg, South Africa</cite></blockquote>



<p>If there was an NYC 101, this would be the first lesson. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The average rent in the Big Apple is $3,105. A two bedroom averages $3,407 and a one bedroom goes for $2,730. You might also have to deal with the infamous broker fees which may not exist where you come from. Rent prices will definitely be one of the hardest things to overcome if you live in New York City. </span></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rent is so expensive. If you&#8217;re an adult in your late 20&#8217;s you&#8217;ll probably still need a roommate! Save as much as you can since each move costs so much!”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><cite>Abby Salgado, Houston, Texas</cite></blockquote>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not all bad. Some places are </span><a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170217/astoria/millennials-new-york-city-roommates-roomi" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more affordable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than others and good deals do exist.

Staten Island might surprise you with its affordability compared to the Bronx, where </span><a href="https://www.metro.us/new-york/bronx-rent-increases-are-outpacing-manhattan-brooklyn/zsJpha---F8OS9GTha9YN6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rents are rising faster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than you could believe.</span></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before I moved to NYC I wished I knew that I should have moved to a less desirable neighborhood that still offered an affordable rent. I had the chance to move to an amazing apartment in Bedstuy 12 years ago but chose not to because the area was kinda gritty. The rent was reaaaaally affordable but I passed and regret it to this day.”</span></i></p><cite>Stacey Walters, New Orleans, LA</cite></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>2. The cost of moving and living in NYC is nuts.</b></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before I moved to NYC I wished I knew that it&#8217;s not like the movies. It&#8217;s VERY competitive. Commutes home can be up to an hour even if you don&#8217;t live far. Everything really is expensive. Negotiate your salary hard!”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><cite>Abby Salgado, Houston, Texas</cite></blockquote>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC has some of the </span><a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/what-is-the-cost-of-living-in-new-york-city" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highest income tax rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country at 7%-12% and a cost of living 68.8% higher than the national average. Rent is so high, it’s easy to develop tunnel vision. Don’t let that happen to you or the cost living will leap out of a side alley, tackle you on your way home from work and run off with your fun money. </span></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keep your expectations in check &#8211; a lot of regular things here are astronomically priced (like rent and movie tickets) and not everything is common (like washer and dryers in the units and closets that fit adult clothes!).”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><cite>Whitney Williams, Chicago, Illinois</cite></blockquote>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning a budget and sticking to it is important in any city, but that goes quadruple for New York. Which brings us to our next point . . . </span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>3. If you&#8217;re moving to NYC, roommates are a requirement.</b></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Be prepared to hustle. Rent goes up every year for most people. And sometimes your job salary doesn&#8217;t go up with it. My rent only costs me 1/3 of my monthly paycheck after taxes but I also have roommates to cut costs. If I didn&#8217;t have roommates I would not be able to survive in a studio, let alone an apartment without roommates.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><cite>Kayla Preston, Maryland</cite></blockquote>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it’s so expensive, a roommate should be treated as non-optional. Water, shelter, food, roommate. That&#8217;s NYC 101. Those are the four requirements of any New York City Survival Guide. But this is actually good news! You moved to one of the biggest, most awesome cities in the world because you enjoy being around people. Maybe it’s social, or perhaps for you, it’s strictly business. A blend of motivations is pretty common. Regardless of what drives you, there are many reasons, financially, socially and for your career, why&nbsp;NYC is the best place to have roommates.</span></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The best advice I was given &amp; would give to someone else moving to NYC is to move to Brooklyn. Everybody commutes, so don&#8217;t confine yourself to neighborhoods close to work if they don&#8217;t fit your budget and lifestyle.”</span></i></p><cite>Sibabalwe Mona, Johannesburg, South Africa</cite></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>4. Don’t experience the city alone.</b></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Always get a roommate for your first apartment in this city. Sign and notarize a roommate agreement regarding expectations, rules and consequences for breaking the agreement. Submit this agreement to your landlord along with your lease. It will give you peace of mind.”</span></i></p><cite>Stacey Walters, New Orleans, LA</cite></blockquote>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If saving money on rent and experiencing NYC in all its glorified awesomeness isn’t enough to motivate you to find yourself a partner in crime, then think of your health.&nbsp;Studies have shown that living alone can shorten your lifespan. It shouldn’t come as a big shock, people are social by nature!</span></p>

	</div>
	


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That said, being independent offers unique life experiences. Like investigating that weird sound in the kitchen at night armed with a cardboard tube and protected by little more than Ninja Turtle underpants&#8230; Only to find out it was just a massive leak ruining the floor. What a relief. But&nbsp;a little independence goes a long way for city living. So take a dip into that lifestyle, it’s good for you. Just don’t be SO independent that you find yourself without a community and support group here in the city. </span>If there&#8217;s anything you can take away from this NYC 101 lesson, it&#8217;s this point!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>5. You know what cars and bedbugs have in common? They both suck in NYC.</b></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before I moved to NYC I wished I knew that having a car wasn&#8217;t worth the parking tickets!”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><cite>Whitney Williams, Chicago, Illinois</cite></blockquote>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You seriously don’t even need a car in NYC, that&#8217;s a very important lesson of NYC 101. The public transit system and your own two legs can get you to all kinds of places and wherever there’s a gap, there’s a taxi ready to serve. You don’t want to get stuck choosing between (legal) parking fees and eating out. And pay attention, renegades in the crowd . . . entire career paths have been built around the art of dispensing parking tickets in this town. It’s just not worth it.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before I moved to New York City I wish I knew about mattress protectors. There wasn&#8217;t really too much about New York City that I wasn&#8217;t expecting, except for an unfortunate experience of having bed bugs when I first moved to New York City! I had to throw everything out. The only thing that I could save with my clothes after washing them three times.”</span></i></p><cite>Kayla Preston, Maryland</cite></blockquote>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bed bugs in NYC are beyond gross. It’s bad enough they are disgusting, vile, spawns of evil. They are also resilient, tough to see, and oh yeah, </span><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/avoid-mutating-bed-bugs-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mutating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In New York, it’s going to get crowded. S</span>o, y<span style="font-weight: 400;">ou will brush shoulders with all kinds of people. </span>But s<span style="font-weight: 400;">ome of </span>them <span style="font-weight: 400;">could make your evening or your career. Others you won’t so be thrilled about. So while you might be tempted, for perfectly reasonable reasons, to snag that “free sofa” on the side of the road… just don’t!</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>6. There are actually lots of affordable things to do in NYC.</b></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The best advice I was given &amp; would give to someone else moving to NYC is to move to Brooklyn. Everybody commutes, so don&#8217;t confine yourself to neighborhoods close to work if they don&#8217;t fit your budget and lifestyle.”</span></i></p><cite>Sibabalwe Mona, Johannesburg, South Africa</cite></blockquote>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so much doom and gloom about the cost of living and rent, you’ll be happy to know that NYC has a ton of cheap stuff to do. This is the fun section of NYC 101!

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>7. Watch out for scams.</b></h3>



<p>You will graduate NYC 101 they day you learn to recognize all the weird little scams in New York City. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Online scams, shady brokers, and opportunistic bottom feeders are not, contrary to some gritty movies, the majority of the population in NYC. There are plenty of great people to get to know. But. sneaky scammers are out there. They want your money and they are pretty flexible with how they acquire it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So stay enthusiastic about moving to the Big Apple, because it really is one of the coolest places on Earth. But just watch out for any shady deals.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snag that selfie stick, mount up your camera, and set out for the best places to take spots in NYC. New York has plenty of Instagram worthy places</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you just hang around long enough, a photo op will find you. Just one of the many perks of living in one of the most exciting cities in the world. So, here&#8217;s a list of the five most Instagrammable places in NYC. Just a friendly reminder, though, it’s a selfie stick, not a bludgeoning tool for self-defense. So always look both ways before swiping the street.</span> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of the most Instagrammable places in NYC: <b>Empire State Building Observation Deck</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re new to New York,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this is a <a href="https://www.esbnyc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">must</a>. Yes, it’s a little cliché, but you can get an astounding view of the city right behind you. </span>So, i<span style="font-weight: 400;">f your parents are worried about you moving to the Big Apple, this is the best place to put their fears at ease by sending a selfie pic of you sporting your brightest smile with the city of opportunity as the backdrop. Unless, of course, your parents are afraid of heights.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Brooklyn Bridge</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to bring more waterfront property and emotionally gripping sunsets into the mix, then head on over to the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.freetoursbyfoot.com/walking-the-brooklyn-bridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooklyn Bridge</a> and get a shot of the skyline with your smiling mug in it. </span>You can click plenty of great snaps along the pedestrian walkways.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Keep it cool, though</span> because t<span style="font-weight: 400;">his is not the place to do your personal imitation of King Kong. Two tourists</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">got <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://nypost.com/2017/01/25/tourists-arrested-over-risky-brooklyn-bridge-selfies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested</a> for climbing out onto a narrow beam and getting a little too adventurous in search of an epic shot.</span> Just because it&#8217;s one of the most Instagrammable places in NYC, doesn&#8217;t mean you need to go to all out for the snap.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>The Highline Park</b></h2>



<p><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/the-high-line" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Highline Park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an elevated rail system turned gorgeous walking path. It’s located in the lower section of Manhattan and offers views of the waterfront plus great views of the city. With plenty of native plants growing along the well maintained path, this is a pleasant, natural setting to take a selfie in.</span> Trust us, this is definitely one of the most Instagrammable places in NYC, don&#8217;t miss it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Coney Island</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a place a little more off the beaten path if you’ve already racked up selfies in the more popular NYC areas.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.coneyisland.com/tourist-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Coney Island</a> is a big amusement area with over 50 rides. </span>And it is one of the most Instagrammable places in NYC, maybe even the whole world. So, <span style="font-weight: 400;">there’s a bunch of little businesses all operating independently, so it feels more like a bazaar than Six Flags. There is a Ferris wheel on site, which is just screaming for selfies. </span>I<span style="font-weight: 400;">f you can keep it all contained within the safety limits of your seat. There’s never a good time to drop a cell phone. But there are some spectacularly bad ones.</span> </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Wall Art And Street Performances</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC has lots of unexpected selfie spots that pop up when you least expect it. You can round the corner and find a masterfully crafted piece of art painted on the side of a wall, just begging for your personal interpretation of awesomeness. While fixed locations have the benefit of being . . . well, fixed, don’t overlook the random events that find you when you’re exploring one of the coolest places on earth.</span> These happen to be some of the most Instagrammable places in NYC!</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No time to wait</span> because t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he next viral internet phenomena could have your face written all over it. </span>So, g<span style="font-weight: 400;">rab your phone and start your journey into the the city in search of the next big thing to hit the internet since Instagram was invented.</span> And we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll discover many more Instagram worthy places in New York!</p>
