<p>In New York, it&#8217;s a bit impractical to get an apartment by yourself.

<p>Roomi also conducts background checks and ID verification to avoid fraud and scams. Plus, in-app messaging to ensure that the conversations you&#8217;re having are safe and secure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-look-for-roommates-through-facebook-or-craigslist">2. Look for roommates through Facebook or Craigslist</h3>



<p>Before roommate finder apps and websites existed, Facebook, Craigslist, and even Reddit were the go-to platforms. It&#8217;s a bit old school as numerous people just post statuses that say: <em>&#8216;looking for roommates!&#8217;</em> and hope that someone they&#8217;ll eventually get along with answers.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it&#8217;s still effective, but you have to take precautions as there are a lot of scammers and fake profiles that can trick you if you&#8217;re not careful. To avoid this, be specific with your listing, and once you&#8217;re talking to a potential roomie, call them through video call (to ensure they&#8217;re actually the one in the profile!).</p>

<p>Roommate flyers may seem old-fashioned, but it&#8217;s never out of style. Sticking roommate flyers or posters on public bulletin boards, residence halls, lamp posts, walls, etc., is still as effective as posting a listing online. Just make sure that you have permission to stick your flyer in different places. </p>



<p>Roomi Tip: Be specific about the roommate that you&#8217;re looking for in your flyer. List down the specific qualities you&#8217;re looking for and the dealbreakers. This way, people will know if they fit the criteria or not.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-ask-friends-and-family">4. Ask friends and family</h3>



<p>A roommate doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be a stranger. You can ask family members and close friends if you have any around the area to be your roommate. Having a roommate who you already know and trust makes the prospect of living together more enjoyable.</p>



<p>However, some also advise against living with a close friend or relative as arguments or misunderstandings may happen. There may be disagreements that can become too personal and lead to a broken relationship. Still, all these can be avoided with proper communication.</p>



<p>If not friends and family themselves, maybe they know someone who&#8217;s also looking for a roommate and they can refer you. New York&#8217;s a big city with over 19 million people living in the city, it&#8217;s impossible that you wouldn&#8217;t be able to find a roommate!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-go-to-mixers-and-meetups-and-network-with-potential-roommates">5. Go to Mixers and Meetups and network with potential roommates</h3>



<p>Mixers and meetups in New York are common: it happens almost every week with different groups all around the city. Specifically, there are meetup events and roommate mixers hosted by local community organizations, apartment complexes, or social networking groups that you can attend.</p>



<p>This way, you get to meet your potential roommates in person, talk to them, get a feel of their vibe, and see if you&#8217;ll get along well. More than that, these events are a sure way of avoiding scammers and fake online profiles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-hard-is-it-to-find-a-roommate-in-nyc-well">How Hard Is It to Find a Roommate in NYC? Well&#8230;</h2>



<p>Finding a roommate in NYC may seem like a daunting task, but it&#8217;s definitely achievable. With a positive attitude, thorough research, and a bit of patience, you can find the perfect roommate to share your NYC adventure with.</p>



<p>Attend local events, utilize online platforms, and network with friends and colleagues to increase your chances of finding a compatible roommate. To make roommate finding easier for you, use Roomi. It&#8217;s the best app to find apartments and roommates without having to worry about your security and privacy being breached.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Finding a roommate is tough. Let&#8217;s say you finally found your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/9-reasons-why-living-with-a-roommate-is-awesome-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">dream roommate</a>. Now what? Time to find fun traditions to explore with your roommate! When you find a Roomi as awesome as you, you need to make sure they stick around. First, make sure that you are a good roommate to them. Then, break the ice by spending time with roommates with these easy and fun roomi traditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Spa Day: Skincare tradition to explore with your roommate</h2>



<p>Going out to get a facial and massage can cost you close to a hundred bucks. Now that all of us live under an umbrella of coronavirus, it&#8217;s best to avoid going out anyway. Having a spa day at home won&#8217;t cost you more than a few dollars, max. Plus, you&#8217;ll be inside the comfort of your house and be free to enjoy a glass of wine while you&#8217;re at it! So take out your fluffy robe and comfy slippers and explore with your roommate, all the new skincare fads!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/heyarnold-nickelodeon-hey-arnold-xT1Ra0MKzjbQhpz4NW"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/xT1Ra0MKzjbQhpz4NW/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="Hey Arnold Nickelodeon GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="360" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Plan one day out of the month to be your spa day. If a monthly routine seems like a big commitment, just pull out the &#8220;us-time&#8221; when you feel like you need to relax and rejuvenate. You can plan to do each other&#8217;s nails and face mask, but nothing beats a good foot massage! Once you rub your roommate&#8217;s feet, you&#8217;re practically best friends.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Venting Time: Explore your deepest feelings with your roommate</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s be real. One thing people love more than complaining about their life is talking about how busy they are and how being busy is adding stress to their lives. But why does it feel sooooo good to vent about your stress and life issues?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/cbs-h50-hawaiifive0-3o6gEcsu2lapoSO3N6"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/3o6gEcsu2lapoSO3N6/giphy.gif?resize=400%2C225&#038;ssl=1" alt="Roommates Roomies GIF by CBS - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="400" height="225" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Eva Stubits, Ph.D., a Houston-based clinical psychologist specializing in stress management, says that talking about your personal stress can help you get it out of your system. Basically, talking about the feelings that are bothering you enables you to process them faster. You and your roommate can have a day or two during the week to open the lid and let off some steam. It&#8217;ll be a great way to mutually <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-benefits-of-living-with-roommates-vs-living-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support each other</a> and catch up on the craziness of your lives.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Furniture Shopping = Retail therapy + company of a good roommate </h2>



<p>With the dawn of the &#8220;work from home&#8217; culture, it&#8217;s going to be up to you to make your space more inspiring and Insta-worthy. Since you and your roommate could be looking at spending most of your hours at home, this is a good activity for you both. You can make it a regular tradition to explore with your roommate for thrifty furniture and home decor items.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Weekly Clean-up: Productivity + opportunity for spending time with roommates!</h2>



<p>Cleaning up after yourself is a good roommate etiquette that you should practice every day. Decluttering, washing your dishes, and watering your plants (if you have any) is something you should engage in daily. A weekly cleaning session with your roommate where you can sweep, mop, and vacuum can be a fun exercise. Instead of dreading the effort required from your end to complete these chores, you&#8217;re more likely to hang out and chill if you&#8217;re sharing tasks with your roommate and doing them together. So blast that cheesy Spotify playlist, and get scrubbing!</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Movie Night: spending quality time with roommates made easy</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that this tradition is loved worldwide. Just the thought of coming home to a glass of margarita and a dose of laughter from your favorite standup comedian on Netflix, while you chill on the couch with chips down your shirt. Co-living doesn&#8217;t get better than this! To make your monthly movie night even better, bring some buttery popcorn and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/easy-cocktail-recipes-to-try-at-home-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">DIY your favorite drink</a>!</p>

</div></figure>



<p>No matter what you do, spend time with each other; you don&#8217;t get to chose the family you&#8217;re born into but you do get to chose your friends. If you&#8217;re a friend to your roommate, your roommate is going to consider you one as well.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you invest the time to find a roommate in NYC, put together a list of everything you want to check. Asking lots of questions up front can be time-consuming, yes. And doing something like a background check can be a little intimidating at first, true. But think about it. You are about to open the door wide open, hand over a set of keys, provide easy access to all your stuff, and place your financial well-being in the hands of a complete and total stranger.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, sounds like a good time to be thorough.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Do a background check</b> if you want to find a good roommate in NYC</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a <a href="https://www.realtor.com/advice/rent/run-background-check-roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">background check</a> on a roommate is street smart. I</span>t&#8217;s not just the tatted up guys with leather jackets who might be trouble.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just look at politicians these days. Sure, they smile nice, and they’ve got pleasant things to say. But you wouldn’t trust at least half of them to babysit a basket of dirty laundry, let alone have access to your iPhone while you’re not around.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do a <b>credit check</b> when you are trying to find a roommate in NYC</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The harsh reality is that your roommate’s credit score is going to affect your ability to sign a lease. Having a great roommate can go south fast if you discover later that they have bad credit and you can’t renew. Next thing you know, you’re moving into a lousy room in a bad part of town with your super sweet, mired in credit debt roommate. Who will totally take you out to dinner to make up for it if you just spot them twenty dollars.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Do an employment check</b> when trying to find a roommate in NYC</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because someone has <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/score-basics/what-is-a-good-credit-score/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">good credit</a> doesn’t mean it’s going to stay that way. It’s a tough economy, and you might be tempted to cut someone a break. Especially if they have a plan that sounds good. But do yourself a favor and get two paystubs, or at the bare minimum, an acceptance letter for a new job with the salary right there, plain as can be. If you don’t, you could end up stuck shouldering their part of the rent on top of your own in a matter of months.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Furniture wars: avoid a broken home</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways to get tripped up by furniture and appliances: Not having enough, and having way, way too much. The latter is easier to bump into than you might think. Rooms in NYC are small. A couch is going to occupy a considerable amount of real estate. Picture this. Your roommate shows up on move-in day, dazzling you with their sunny disposition and eye-catching organizational skills. You both suddenly realize there isn’t enough room for the combined might of your couches. Your roommate is now stuck trying to find <a href="https://metropolismoving.com/blog/best-storage-facilities-nyc/" class="broken_link">storage</a> last minute or selling it fast at a lost. You are so losing your BFF card over this. </span>So th<span style="font-weight: 400;">e moral of the story</span>&#8211; sort out your furniture before anyone moves in. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Conflict is ultimately driven by resource mismanagement: AKA food</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people think it’s hilarious when other people name their sandwiches. MIA leftovers and filthy cooking areas are one of the first places roommates discover just how well they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get along. Lay the ground rules down for food and cooking during the interview. And if it gets really bad, start making sandwiches with expired anchovies and excessive abuse of hollandaise. People will steal your food less if you give them the impression you’re a terrible cook.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Parking meters: the unsung hero of utility bills</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where is your roommate going to park their car? How accessible is parking? Does your roommate have other means of transportation, like a bicycle or moped? If so, where are those going to go? Don’t make the mistake of omitting parking problems if you know it’s tough in your neighborhood and your prospective roommate fails to ask. Head off the problem before it starts.</span> So, make sure everyone is clear beforehand about parking. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>It’s better together . . . until it’s not: guests</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re roommates great. Wish you could say the same about their entourage. Mixed social gatherings, girly hordes, rambling bro-packs. Overnight guests that never seem to leave. People popping in and out, slamming doors, eating your food, taking your parking spot. The number of ways that guests can mess with your real estate relationship is literally without end. Check with your roommate beforehand to get a sense of how much socializing they plan to base out of the apartment. </span></p>

<p>When moving to a new city, you take into consideration things like potential job opportunities, affordable housing, and the social scene. While working your dream job may be your top priority, finding ways to enjoy your time off comes in as a tight second. While you may assume you need to jump on a plane and fly across the world to explore, don’t forget about the endless adventures to be had in your backyard. And who better to experience them with than your co-living partner in crime? Baltimore roommates are among the lucky ones, who won’t have to leave town just to get away. Here’s just a short list of how you and your roommate can enjoy an awesome staycation in Charm City. So if you don&#8217;t have roommates, it&#8217;s time to use a roommate finder in Baltimore. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A staycation for Baltimore roommates</h2>



<p>In brief, a staycation refers to a vacation that doesn’t involve traveling. But rather spending time close to home and enjoying local attractions in your own city. It’s the perfect way to embrace a new city or neighborhood. Or even discover the unknown in a place you’ve been in for a while. The charming city of Baltimore has something for friends, lovers, and families to enjoy year-round, all in its very own Inner Harbor. So gather your Baltimore roommates and get ready to enjoy a lovely staycation. And if you&#8217;re looking for roommates, get that roommate finder in Baltimore out and search for the person to celebrate staycations!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">For the animal lovers</h3>



<p>The Inner Harbor is known to most as a port of call for cruise ships. But the Harbor is also a landmark for the city of Baltimore and a major tourist attraction just waiting for locals to enjoy. One of the most popular attractions at the harbor is the National Aquarium. With over 20,000 aquatic animals, there’s surely a creature or two you’ve never seen before. Baltimore roommates will love the aquarium’s newest exhibit, the Living Seashore, which has become the hot spot for guests, says Kate Rowe, Director of Media Relations at The National Aquarium.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Moreover, this exhibit showcases a mid-Atlantic seashore habitat and features two large touch pools where guests can actually walk up and touch the animals (with proper guidance from our team),” explains Rowe.</p></blockquote>



<p>Some of the animals in this exhibit include Atlantic stingrays, sea stars, horseshoe crabs, and moon jellies. The staff works hard to create engaging experiences that are inspiring for all guests. So time to take your animal loving Baltimore roommates for the best possible staycation ever! </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“From tactile learning in our new touch pool exhibit and fully immersive experiences in our rain forest and Australia exhibits, to our close to 40 daily talks with animal care staff…there’s something for everyone at the Aquarium! It’s a place to build and make connections,” she adds.</p></blockquote>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Looking for a deal? We&#8217;ve got you! </h4>



<p>They also offer great deals. Head over any Friday night after 5 p.m. and get the full aquarium experience for half price. That’s right, bring along your Baltimore roommates and that’s a two-for-one special you can enjoy together. You can even make it a double date! The more the merrier, right? Additionally, if you’re bringing along miniature roommates, kids eat free Monday through Thursday at The Hard Rock Cafe. Check out the <a href="https://aqua.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">aquarium’s website</a> for a number of year-round discounts including military, parking and other promotions.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">For the food loving Baltimore roommates</h3>



<p>If you’re a foodie (especially a seafood lover), you’ve picked one of the coolest cities to settle — and dig — into. Baltimore Ravens Defensive Back Nick Perry says that eating is for sure one of his favorite things to do in Charm City, and there’s rarely a dull moment for Baltimore roommates. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“There’s always something to do. Baltimore is known for its seafood. Their crab cakes are out of this world!” he tells us.</p></blockquote>



<p>Surprised? Don’t be. Baltimore’s foodie reputation is often overlooked. In fact, Thrillist named it one of the seven most <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/where-to-eat-in-america-the-7-most-underrated-american-food-cities-in-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underrated American food cities</a> in 2015, saying Baltimore is a kind of “petri-dish” left to its own instrument. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“It sits there just out of the spotlight until you take off the lid and realize all of the crazy stuff happening inside. The art, music, and food scenes are filled with thriving communities that not only don’t frown on experimentation, but expect it,” Dan Gentile, the article’s author, writes.</p></blockquote>



<p>Even better? There’s a plethora of farms within a 15-minute drive of downtown. And weekly farmer’s markets to assist the farm-to-table advocates and&nbsp;vegan Baltimore roommates in stocking the fridge.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">For the Art and History Buffs</h3>



<p>Moreover, for Baltimore roommates who are feeling artsy or are in the mood to learn about history or culture, the city has enough museums to keep you busy and learning for weeks on end. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Just for starters, there’s the <a href="https://artbma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baltimore Museum of Art</a></h4>



<p>The largest museum in Maryland, the BMA has over 90,000 works of art available to you for free, every day. The Matisse collection is especially perfect for modern and contemporary art lovers and includes a state-of-the art lighting showcase.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thewalters.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Walter’s Art Museum</a></h4>



<p>Celebrating 55 centuries of art from around the world ranging from the Millenium B.C. to the early 20th century, is ideal for the Balitmore roommates more into classic art. Once you’ve roamed the museum and fueled up on inspiration, Walter’s also gives you a chance to make some art of your own on the weekends with their Drop-In Art events.
