<p>New York City is a vibrant and diverse metropolis with countless neighborhoods to explore. While some areas may get more attention than others, there are plenty of hidden gems that offer a unique and authentic New York experience.</p>



<p>From cultural hubs to up-and-coming communities, these underrated neighborhoods are worth considering if you&#8217;re looking for a fresh perspective on city living. Discover the top 10 underrated neighborhoods in NYC to live in for 2024 and see why they&#8217;re the best-kept secrets of the Big Apple!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-underrated-neighborhoods-in-nyc">10 Underrated Neighborhoods in NYC</h2>



<p>New York&#8217;s about branching out beyond what&#8217;s familiar and comfortable. So, here’s a list of underrated neighborhoods in NYC that deserve your attention.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-yorkville">1. Yorkville</h3>

This neighborhood doesn’t score particularly high on the “cool radar” but Yorkville has virtually no violent crime and overall an extremely low crime index. The neighborhood is also commuter-friendly as it&#8217;ll only take you around 15 minutes to get to Times Square with the Q train.</p>
