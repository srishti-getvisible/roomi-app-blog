<p>Living in New York City can be an exhilarating and rewarding experience, but it can also come with a hefty price tag. Whether you&#8217;re a student, a young professional, or just looking to supplement your income, finding ways to make extra money in NYC can feel like a daunting task. But, there are plenty of opportunities waiting for you in the city that never sleeps.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore eight different ways you can make some extra cash by working part-time. From freelance gigs to sharing economy platforms, these options are sure to get you excited about the possibilities of earning more in the Big Apple. So let&#8217;s dive in and explore the many ways you can fatten your wallet and make the most of your time in NYC!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-extra-ways-to-make-money-in-nyc">8 Extra Ways to Make Money in NYC</h2>



<p>Especially if you’re starting by yourself professionally and don’t have much to fall back on, the financial stress is real! You’ve got to find that side hustle! Check out these part-time jobs in New York to make some extra cash.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-drive-for-uber-or-taskrabbit"><strong>1. Drive for Uber or TaskRabbit</strong></h3>



<p>If you don’t mind driving around NYC – given the crowded streets and rush-hour madness – you can consider driving people or goods across the city. It works best if you have a car, but you can rent one too.</p>



<p>If you’re sure that moody customers can’t get through your bubble of Zen, you’ll make a great Uber or Lyft driver, picking a schedule you&#8217;re okay with. You can also deliver groceries or packages through FreshDirect or TaskRabbit.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what else you can do:</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Deliver food for UberEats, GrubHub, Doordash, Eat24, etc.</li>



<li>Deliver clothes for ByNext.</li>



<li>Deliver packages with Amazon Flex.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<p>New York has enough customers for all these services to have constant delivery needs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-pet-sit-or-walk-dogs"><strong>2. Pet-sit or walk dogs</strong></h3>



<p>If you like pets, this is a great part-time job for you! There are many New Yorkers who have beloved dogs, but no time to take them for walks. Some dog owners pay good money for someone knowledgeable about dogs to take their pet for a walk and make sure it gets exercise and playtime.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on the owner’s cat, dog, or bird (and let’s hope it’s nothing more dangerous), feed them, give them their meds, etc. Find your side gig on pet-sitting websites like Pet Sitters International or Pet Sitting NYC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-freelance-for-small-businesses"><strong>3. Freelance for small businesses</strong></h3>



<p>The big, diverse city of New York has many small businesses popping up every day. They all have requirements for amateurs and side hustlers like photographers, blog writers, social media managers, graphic designers, web developers, etc.</p>

<p>Create a website portfolio, however basic, so prospective hirers can understand what you do. Most work will be simple, but the core team just won’t have enough time or enough expertise to make a good job out of it.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can find other freelancing jobs to do remotely for people from across the country. For both kinds of gigs, keep checking career websites like&nbsp;LinkedIn or Indeed.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Become a personal chef</strong></h3>



<p>This is a great side gig for that extra cash if you&#8217;re good at cooking and enjoy the task. The busy lifestyle of New Yorkers doesn&#8217;t allow time to cook for themselves. However, most residents are highly concerned about their health and are eager to improve it.</p>



<p>Sign up on websites that act as a platform between people looking for food and people who cook. Depending on your schedule and the client’s needs, you can decide what meals you can cook for them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Become a personal trainer or a coach</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re into physical activities and sports, you can become a personal coach for people looking for a range of different services. Since the pandemic, a lot more people have opted to do workouts from home through YouTube or by hiring a personal coach.</p>



<p>So, if you can coach someone for activities like home workouts and running in the parks, this is a good time for you. Sign up on platforms like&nbsp;CoachUp&nbsp;where you can meet clients and like-minded coaches.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Babysit or House sit</h3>



<p>Babysitting is a classic way to make extra money and the role of a babysitter is very commonly seen in popular movies and TV shows. But remember, babysitting is a serious job too! You&#8217;ll have to spend time and care for babies and children, make sure they&#8217;re fed, bathed, and put into bed at the right time.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>So, make sure that before your first babysitting job, do some research on your own and talk to the parents about the child you&#8217;re babysitting. It&#8217;s better to be prepared!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Do private classes or tutoring online</h3>



<p>There are a lot more opportunities online now, so one way to make extra money in NYC is to offer your tutoring services. You can start by messaging your contacts, broadcasting your services on social media and tutoring platforms, and applying to different job offers that are looking for an online teacher.</p>



<p>Just make sure that you’re knowledgeable on the subject or topic that you’ll be teaching, whether it’s math, science, or <a href="https://brighterly.com/reading-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading classes</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Buy and resell stuff</h3>



<p>Buying and selling takes a lot of work, but if you have the eye for hunting for things that could still be used, maybe this is the extra work for you. You just have to ensure that the things you&#8217;re buying can actually sell or are still in good condition to be housed by another person.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Ways to Make Extra Money in NYC: Final Word</h2>
