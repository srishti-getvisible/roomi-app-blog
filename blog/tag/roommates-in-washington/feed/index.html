<p>If you’re on the hunt for a new home, you’re likely looking for the most affordable apartments for rent in Washington D.C., right? Rent control is a pretty nice setup in some of America’s major metros. And Washington D.C. renters are among the&nbsp;lucky ones who can benefit from it.</p>



<p>A lot of the usual rent control laws apply in Washington D.C. as they do in cities like San Francisco&nbsp;and New York City. Whether you’re a new or veteran renter, here’s what you should know. Plus, some tips and a free online tool for finding rent-controlled apartments in Washington D.C.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-rent-control">What is Rent Control?</h2>



<p>Rent control is a legal system administered by the government to limit the amount that landlords can charge for in rent and lease. This also limits how much landlords can raise rent for tenants.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-state-rent-in-washington-d-c">The state rent in Washington D.C.</h3>



<p>Finding apartments for rent in Washington D.C. isn’t complicated, as long as budget isn&#8217;t a factor. With a $1,500 budget, one can find an empty rental unit and the price increases the more amenities you need.</p>



<p>And while that might sound frustratingly similar to a lot of major rental markets plagued with high rent prices, the City has been doing its part to make affordable housing more available. Introducing rent control was one of the first steps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rent-control-in-washington-d-c">Rent Control in Washington D.C.</h2>



<p>Rent control is a hot-button issue in cities across the United States, and Washington D.C. is no exception. With skyrocketing housing costs and a dwindling supply of affordable units, many residents are finding it difficult to keep up with the rising rents.</p>

<p>Rent-controlled apartments in Washington D.C. provide a glimmer of hope for those struggling to find affordable housing. But what does it entail?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What buildings qualify for rent control?</h3>



<p>A&nbsp;majority&nbsp;of rental units in D.C. fall under rent control, yet a surprising number of residents aren&#8217;t aware of how pervasive rent control laws are. All rental complexes with four or more units fall under rent control, thanks to this law, with a few notable exceptions. A dwelling is exempt from rent control if:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>It was built after 1975.</li>



<li>The unit has been continuously vacant since January 1, 1985.</li>



<li>The dwelling is owned by a person not owning more than four rentals.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s subsidized by the Government or the District.</li>



<li>The building is under an improvement plan receiving rehabilitation assistance through the Department of Housing and Community Development.</li>
</ol>



<p>Another exemption is if a rental unit isn&#8217;t registered with the Rental Accommocations Division (RAD), it&#8217;s automatically under rent control even if it counts under these exemptions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How much rent in Washington D.C. increases yearly?</h3>



<p>Basically, if you find apartments for rent in Washington D.C. and they’re in buildings with more than four rental units, and they aren’t new, they’re very likely rent-controlled.</p>



<p>All rent increases are based on a yearly adjusted Consumer Price Index (CPI-W), which factors in workers’ wages. This allows the population to keep up with inflation. Meaning, all rent-controlled units increase in rent each year. But by marginally less&nbsp;than newer rentals and other non-rent-controlled units. Landlords can’t increase rent more than 10 percent each year.</p>



<p>But for most tenants, the average yearly increase is the CPI plus another 2 percent. For disabled or elderly tenants, it’s even lower, with a maximum increase of 5 percent per 12 months.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exceptions to the&nbsp;rule</h3>



<p>In the case that a unit becomes vacant, the landlord can raise the rent&nbsp;price more than once in the same year. The “vacancy increase” rule allows the landlord to:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Increase rent by 10 percent more than was charged to the former tenant; Or,</li>



<li>Rent it for the price of a comparable rental unit, but the rent hike can’t be more than 30 percent.</li>
</ol>



<p>There’s also a clause in the Rental Housing Act of 1985 that allows landlords/property owners to claim hardship. Essentially, if they find themselves unable to make a 12 percent rate of return on the property (with 12-15 months of paper proof of the fact), they can raise the rent to make that 12 percent.</p>



<p>Additionally, a property owner can petition to raise the rent to make improvements to the building required by local law. That being said, tenants should stay in the know about whether their landlord is following the legal processes to raise rent. And if you live in a home that falls under rent control&nbsp;but hasn&#8217;t been registered, you should file a complaint.</p>

<p>All you have to do is input the location or area you&#8217;re planning to move in to and Roomi will show you a list of affordable apartments available for rent. You can then filter your search by duration (flexible, fixed, and 12 months), layout, type of property, number of bedrooms, and popular amenities. Aside from these, there are options to show only ID-verified listings and to input an age range, preferred gender, and the amount of monthly rent.</p>



<p>Roomi also protects its users with its background checks, ID verification, and in-app messaging features.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. With the Section 8 voucher program</h3>



<p>When finding rent-controlled apartments in Washington D.C., the issues lie in vacancy rates pricing, and availability in general. If you’re moving to D.C. with little in the bank, you might apply for&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/find-section-eight-housing/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Section 8</a>, a voucher program for low-income, elderly, or disabled renters.</p>



<p>Due to the increase of rents in the city, with the Section 8 voucher, you&#8217;ll most likely have better luck with smaller units. It&#8217;s less common to find more than a three-bedroom section 8 house in Washington, D.C..</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Scoping out the rent-controlled buildings</h3>



<p>If you don’t qualify for Section 8, there are still plenty of techniques to finding affordable apartments in D.C. The first step is to do some research before you hit the streets looking. Use D.C.’s affordable housing locator, and see what comes up. Research the neighborhoods, and use a realtor to help with the legwork.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a tip: Always&nbsp;ask your landlord&nbsp;about the details of the place you want to rent. Because the landlord will have to disclose that information, legally speaking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Washington D.C. and Its Rent-Controlled Apartments: The Verdict</h2>



<p>With low vacancy rates, it may be difficult to secure a rent-controlled apartment from scratch. But you&nbsp;can&nbsp;run into some luck by finding a housemate who already did the dirty work of locking one down and has an open room to fill. Even if it doesn’t have every amenity on your list, locking down an affordable apartment offers you a lot to gain.</p>

<p>So, you’ve pledged your allegiance to a political candidate, followed the debates and made your obligatory visits to the White House and Washington Monument. Now that America’s political hub is your new home , you’ve committed to fulfilling your duties as model roommates in Washington. But despite going through the motions, you’re not into politics as much as you hoped. Sure, you’ll discuss the topic in passing, but at the end of the day, you’d rather spend your time at art galleries, open mic nights, and every Smithsonian museum for the hundredth time. Hillary Clinton’s in town? That’s neat, but you’d rather go to that Walt Whitman reading on Friday. In a city saturated with politicians, lobbyists, and activists, roommates in Washington wonder how to survive and thrive in D.C. </p>

<p><strong>Perfect for:&nbsp;</strong>The thrill-seeking roommates in Washington</p>



<p>If the idea of hidden rooms, secret passageways, and treasure hunts evokes a sense of excitement and thrills from within, the <a href="https://omansion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mansion On O Street tours</a> are a perfect day activity for roommates in Washington to enjoy.

<p><strong>Perfect for:&nbsp;</strong>The indie-film buff roommates in Washington</p>



<p>There’s really nothing better than a movie date, but when you’ve already seen every film out in mainstream cinemas, you’ll want to take a chance on the <a href="http://www.wpfs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Psychotronic Film Society</a>. Free to attend for those 21 and over non-profit organization screens old-school. Also, independent films from the Psychotronic genre.

<p><strong>Perfect for:&nbsp;</strong>The rock n’ rollin’ roommates </p>



<p>You won&#8217;t have a problem to find roommates in Washington who love to rock out. D.C.’s Rock &amp; Roll Hotel is not actually a hotel — it&#8217;s an awesome music venue with a rooftop deck, concert hall and lounge. Similarly, notable artists like Rooney, Big D &amp; the Kids Table, and American Authors pass through. Thus, this popular location never fails to draw a crowd with its impressive lineup of rock and indie bands from around the globe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the best offerings the northeast metros have is their variety of transportation options. Using public transportation or driving&nbsp;through hour-long traffic aren’t your preferred methods of getting around? Then biking through the capital city is another great option. For roommates in Washington D.C., who are already battling rising rent costs, using programs like <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Capital Bikeshare</a> or investing in your own two wheels can be both cost-effective and a great way to experience the city. But wait before you hop on and ride off into the sunset. First, familiarize yourself with the biking laws for when you find roommates in Washington D.C. who are like minded. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s a brief list of biking laws for roommates in Washington D.C.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stopping at lights</h3>



<p>Many D.C. cyclists <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/4ayvsr/anyone_willing_to_speak_about_biking_in_dc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">tend to agree</a> that it’s OK to bike through red lights. Only as long as they aren’t interfering with traffic or doing something that could cause an accident or harm others. Though it’s a common occurrence, it’s actually illegal and could land you in the slammer should something go awry. (You don’t want to be <em>those </em>roommates in Washington D.C.)&nbsp;However, a proposal that would allow cyclists to simply yield at red lights is currently under review. And it “would apply to quiet residential areas where under current law cyclists are required to stop even when there’s no one around,” according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2015/12/08/d-c-considering-letting-bicyclists-roll-through-stop-signs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">The Washington Post</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The law would not allow any behavior that threatens the safety of others,” says Tamara Evans, advocacy director for the Washington Area Bicyclist Association. “Stop as yield would apply where no one else currently has the right of way. It would help divert bicyclists from more dangerous streets to safer streets that they might currently avoid because those streets often have stop signs at every block.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Evans says that the proposal, which Council Member Mary Cheh introduced through The Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety Act, might also encourage the Metropolitan Police Department to concentrate on enforcing traffic laws that would be more likely to cause injury or death. Cyclists throughout the city, many who don’t follow the standing law regardless, support the proposed bill. So when you find roommates in Washington D.C. who are cyclists, make sure you tell them that! </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Under the law, cyclists would be required to stop at a red light, but if no traffic was coming, could then proceed through the intersection with caution,” Evans says. “The law distinguishes between red lights and stop signs.”</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What you should know about riding two abreast with roommates in Washington D.C.</h3>



<p>When the weather is nice and you’re looking for something to do, taking a bike ride with roommates in Washington D.C. is a great outdoor activity. Though riding two abreast (when two cyclists ride side-by-side) is legal, it’s more common to see people biking single file. But because bicyclists can use the full lane they’re in, riding two abreast occupies less of the road, according to Evans.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“This is a contentious subject out of the city on two-lane roads, where it is difficult and sometimes dangerous (or illegal) for drivers to pass,” says Evans. “There is an infraction for impeding the flow of traffic by riding two abreast, as we mention in the pocket guide. So it is somewhat situational depending on how many lanes of traffic there are.”</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stay informed about required bicycle parking</h3>



<p>New to biking and worried about where you would store your own? Fortunately, this is no longer a problem for apartment residents and roommates in Washington D.C. Especially for those who don’t want the hassle of lugging a bike upstairs and finding room for it in their home.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“All new and existing buildings in the District now require bicycle parking,” says Evans. “Locations and types of bicycle parking must be shown in building site plans and be approved by the District Department of Transportation during the development review process. There are two sets of regulations governing bike parking in D.C. Code: Title 11 (zoning) shows number of spaces related to size of development and Title 18 (traffic) governs residential specifications, rack placement, and abandoned bikes, where bikes may legally park.”</p></blockquote>



<p>For a full list of D.C. bike laws, WABA’s pocket guide is available <a href="http://www.waba.org/resources/bikelaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use capital bikeshare</h3>



<p>If buying a new bike isn’t in <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/tips-on-how-to-save-money-for-everyone/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">your budge</a>t, Capital Bikeshare is the next best option. The program offers numerous passes allowing roommates in Washington D.C. to rent bikes to commute to their destination. As a member of the program, you can use a bike for a free 30-minute ride. An additional fee will be added to your bill if you go over the first 30 minutes. But every new bike you take offers another free 30-minute trip. So essentially, customers can bike for 30 minutes. Then park the bike in a Capital Bikeshare station (if one is available.) Take out a new bike and ride for 30 minutes again. Considering the inexpensive membership cost, many roommates in Washington D.C. enjoy the convenience of the program.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Biking is my primary mode of transportation. Plus, you can get practically anywhere in D.C. in 30 minutes,” says Erin Gifford, a marketing professional. “The metro is terrible, buses are OK, and walking is great but slow. My company has nine locations throughout the D.C. area, so it’s nice to be able to move about the city easily and quickly on a bike.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Though Gifford notes that it’s frustrating when a bike isn’t available, Capital Bikeshare’s app and the station kiosks notify its members of availability at other stations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Take advice from the pros</h3>



<p>As a cyclist, you really can’t win; cars loathe driving around you, and pedestrians will curse the day you accidentally side-swipe them on the crosswalk. Despite the reputation cyclists have with both parties, however, there are things you can do to avoid confrontation and prevent potential accidents. So when you find roommates in Washington D.C., here&#8217;s something to discuss before you venture out. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“My number one rule is to be predictable,” Mike Abrams, a D.C. paralegal says. “If the cars, pedestrians and other cyclists are expecting you to do what you do, you’ll probably be fine.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Abrams advises practicing safety. Even as an experienced biker! That means going the correct way on one-way streets or using lights and neon vests when biking through the dark. Likewise, cyclists should exercise caution on sidewalks around pedestrians. And they should mind the actions of those around them. If, say, a driver is texting or a passenger of a cab is exiting the car.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“My biggest pet peeve when driving around cyclists is when they pass on the right at intersections,” says Abrams. “The most dangerous interaction between cars and bikes is when the car passes the bike. The cyclist passing the car at the intersection just forces the car to have to pass the bike repeatedly, which is dangerous.“It’s not worth the extra 20 feet by moving to the front of the intersection. When I ride, I try never to force someone to pass me more than once. I act like a car and stay in the middle of the lane at lights. Not saying the cyclist should move to the back of the line at an intersection. But forcing unnecessary extra passes is just stupid, in my opinion.”</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Document everything</h3>



<p>Gifford agrees with the above notion. And while biking is her main mode of transportation now, she admits that cyclists and drivers attempting to pass each other at lights is a common problem. Of course, drivers and pedestrians have their own faults as well.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Pedestrians cross the street whenever they want and jaywalk, forcing me to slam on my brakes so I don’t end up in prison,” Gifford says. “Drivers unaware get way too close, drive in the bike lanes and don’t always look for cyclists. Pedestrians feel like they always have the right of way and refuse to pause for two seconds while I pedal past so I don’t have to stop completely.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In any case, it’s not a bad idea to prepare for the worst case scenario. One precautionary&nbsp;action you can take? Using technology to document what happened.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use technology</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I ride with a GoPro on my handlebars because D.C. has contributory negligence and that combined with MPD’s general apathy toward bike/car crashes doesn’t leave me with much confidence,” says Redditor tiny_apt_brewer. “I got burned once so the GoPro became a $200 insurance policy.</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s not a bad idea, confirms another Redditor by the name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/voikya" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">voikya</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I do the same. I got hit by an Uber driver one time and it proved beyond any doubt that I was completely in the right. Completely paid for itself.”</p></blockquote>



<p>For roommates in Washington D.C., biking can be the ultimate way to experience your new city. So when you find roommates in Washington D.C. who love to bike around, be smart, be safe, and leave your tips for fellow cyclists below!</p>
