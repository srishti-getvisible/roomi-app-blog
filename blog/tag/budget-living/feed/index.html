<p>A brightly lit living room that is decorated with reflective surfaces and mirrors that leave small specks of dispersed sunlight rainbows across the room isn&#8217;t just the perfect decor for the living room — it&#8217;s also a sure shot way to keeping your spirits high throughout the day.</p>



<p>In big cities where finding an apartment of your choice is anyway a task of the highest order, we recommend keeping one requirement consistent throughout your search — <strong>natural light.</strong></p>



<p>Having spent most of the past year indoors, natural light has now become more important than ever. And this is not just for pictures that go on the gram. But for the essential nourishment that our minds and bodies get from natural light.</p>



<p>Feel like it&#8217;s finally time for you to move to a new city? <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-signs-youre-ready-to-move-to-a-new-city-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here are 6 signs that show you&#8217;re ready to move to a new city, even amid the pandemic.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why direct natural light you ask?</h2>



<p>In big cities like New York, where finding an apartment you like is one of the biggest tasks you&#8217;ll go through in your 20s, finding one that fits into your budget will probably end up feeling like a complete blessing.</p>



<p>Sure you&#8217;ll make some compromises to find an apartment that fits your budget. But we would recommend getting a place that has some form of direct sunlight or other. Why?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Direct natural sunlight increases focus and productivity. It has also been proven great for decreasing anxiety and increasing immunity!</h3>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>If people are exposed to light in the morning that mimics the wavelengths of daylight, they become better at coping with anxiety-provoking experiences. The light simply improves the communication between the regions of the brain that are central to our handling of emotions such as stress and anxiety,” says <a href="https://sciencenordic.com/denmark-sleep-disturbance-stress/morning-light-relieves-anxiety/1397274">Ph.D. fellow Brenda Mc Mahon, MD, of the Neurobiology Research Unit at the Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark.</a></p></blockquote>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Natural light also plays an integral role in keeping our immunity, eyesight, and moods in check. Since it is a natural source of vitamin D, it <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/basics/definition/con-20021047">acts as the fool-proof cure to seasonal affective disorder</a> too!</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do I work with natural light to amplify my apartment decor?</h2>



<p>In bigger cities like New York, where coming across any apartment at all is a big task, we recommend all our readers to not be dissuaded by the lack of big windows, or the absence of a killer view.</p>



<p>These things might seem like a drawback in the beginning and you&#8217;d probably feel like you are settling for <em>less</em>, but a smaller window, with limited potential of what one may refer to as a &#8220;killer view&#8221;, isn&#8217;t the worst thing your apartment could have.</p>



<p>Moreover, we&#8217;ve got some pretty easy apartment hacks — that can make even the smallest windows in your apartment act like the best decor ever!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Start by furnishing with light colours.</h3>



<p>Pick a lighter color as often as you can. Making this philosophy the basis of your apartment decor will result in a brighter space, even before the sunlight hits in. Whiter and lighter shades naturally reflect light, and darker shades do the exact opposite.</p>



<p>Pay special attention to your floor, as it receives the most amount of sunlight. This includes the rugs too!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Make decluttering your mantra, as well as the staple piece in your apartment decor.</h3>



<p>Whether your apartment has one small window or 10 large ones, it&#8217;s best to keep this place clear and without any obstruction to allow ample light to pass through. This is by far the easiest way to maximize light in your room. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/caring-for-your-indoor-plants-in-6-simple-tips-roomi/">It is also (one of) the best possible things you can do for the indoor plants you might be interested in keeping!</a></p>



<p>Oh and also, regular cleaning of your window area means you are ensuring that the source, as well as the path of light, remains clean.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Use the following strategies for reflective and non reflective items:</h3>



<p>When it comes to window treatments like blinds and stains, we recommend treating them as lightly as possible.</p>



<p>Ditch the blinds and opt for lighter shades for your curtains. This is especially important if your ultimate goal is to use natural light as an apartment decor piece. Bonus? You wouldn&#8217;t have to switch your lights on!</p>



<p>Some of us may be giving up on some much-desired privacy if we keep all our windows open all day. A better option for those of us would be to opt for lighter blinds. These don&#8217;t completely restrict light from entering your apartment. And get their job done! Also, slivers of light penetrating through lighter blinds look pretty darn cool.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A. <strong>THE LESS SHADOW AN ITEM CREATES THE BETTER</strong></h4>



<p>Using reflective objects like glass for cabinet doors, vases, and shelves are one of the simplest ways to create an airy atmosphere for your apartment. You can also dress these pieces up or down, depending on the season or festival!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">B. <strong>MAXIMISE NATURAL LIGHT BY PLACING MIRRORS AND REFLECTIVE ITEMS ON THE EAST-WEST AREAS.</strong></h4>



<p>We recommend doing this as the sun focuses on each of your east and west walls for half the day.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">C. <strong>TRACK WHERE BEAMS OF LIGHT HIT AND ADD REFLECTIVE PIECES THERE.</strong></h4>



<p>This one&#8217;s quite simple. You&#8217;re the new mayor of Natural Light City. ?</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s a certain room of your apartment that you never need to close the door of, consider removing the door completely. </p>



<p>Or! Replace your pre-existing doors with French doors that can be opened completely, letting in ample amounts of light during the day, across all rooms!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Life hacks 101: Frame EVERYTHING</h2>



<p>Okay, not everything… but you know where we’re going with this. The good news is that you don’t have to throw your favorite posters away. All you need to do is buy actual frames for your posters, artwork and photographs of you with your friends. Your chosen frames don’t have to be fancy either, a simple black or white frame from somewhere like Target or Ikea will do. The addition of framed art and photographs will definitely add personality to your space without breaking the bank balance. This is one of the best apartment hacks that will give your home a personality on a budget!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Life hacks for the plant lovers!</h2>



<p>Nothing, we repeat NOTHING elevates a space more than a houseplant. From succulents to cacti- there are different types and sizes for every type of home. Start off with a couple and add to your collection if and when you can. There’s no such thing as too much when it comes to our green friends. Roomi team recommends the snake plant, it&#8217;s a favorite over here. And while we’re on the topic of how much we *love* plants, did we mention how good they are for you? They purify the air, boost your mood and can even reduce symptoms of mild stress and anxiety? The power of mother nature.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not sure about what plants to get, here&#8217;s a <a href="https://savvygardening.com/apartment-plants/">really helpful guide</a>!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use books as decoration</h2>



<p>If got heaps of books and random knick-knacks lying around at home, this one&#8217;s for you. Instead of hiding them under your bed never to be seen again, consider piling them on your coffee table, near the couch or even stacking them on some shelves near framed photos. Super affordable without looking ‘cheap’, decorating with books is a trick used by interior designers all over the globe. It&#8217;s truly one of the classiest life hacks of all time! From<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/6-travel-books-for-your-wandering-soul-roomi/"> travel books</a> to your favorite fictional tale- they add color and personality to your space! And what’s not to love about showing off how well-read you are?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Portable home bars and trolleys</h2>



<p>This is one of our favorite life hacks! If you’ve got wine bottles taking up valuable space on your kitchen counters, it’s time to give them a proper home. That’s right, it’s time to organize your booze! How very adult of you. We recommend getting a cheap and cheerful bar cart or home trolley. Not only are they great for entertaining, but they add character and color to any home. Another bonus? When your friends leave bottles behind, you can simply pop them on to your bar and add to your collection or tasty décor. Win, win!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Invest in your lighting</h2>



<p>People often forget about lighting when they&#8217;re redecorating and it&#8217;s a big mistake! When you first walk into a room, one of the first things people tend to notice is the lighting. This is one of those cheap life hacks that will completely transform your home without much effort! </p>



<p>Many rental apartments come with standard (and not so stylish) lighting fixtures. So, mixing it up with your own light shades, floor lamps and table lamps will make all the difference. From industrial Scandinavian vibes to bohemian style rattan and bold, statement colors, the options are endless. Not only can you change the whole appearance of your apartment whilst remaining within your budget, but there’s something super cozy and welcoming about warm, low lights. Apartment hacks FTW!</p>
