										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The pandemic is not over yet. It&#8217;s 2021, and while some things have resumed, we still are combatting the Covid-19 virus globally. Recovery of all forms is important, global and individual. And one of the easiest ways of allowing yourself to recover is by practicing gratitude. How does practicing gratitude during a pandemic help? It allows you to see those sides of your days that you may have otherwise forgotten to appreciate. This allows you to be more mindful of the blessings in your life, and more cognizant of the things you have accomplished. It&#8217;s honestly quite simple, you don&#8217;t have to spend money to be happy. Finding alternatives is the healthier way we all need, now more than ever.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">But what does recovering from a pandemic really entail?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Recovery from this year wouldn&#8217;t just mean the introduction and availability of a vaccine, it would also mean policy changes, guided transitions into a pandemic-less world that is created in conjunction with medical experts, scientists, and economists alike. But recovery from this year would also need to mean individual recovery. It becomes generally difficult to gauge the weight on the shoulders of an individual. Especially for a young one, trying to make ends meet, provide for themselves and their family, and navigate a pandemic.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not promising that the following will fix everything. But they might make your every day a little better. So maybe, give it a shot and see if some of them help you make a difference to your days.</p>



<p><strong>Here are 10 things that can possibly make your days better, pandemic or not.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Notice and get excited about the little things.</h2>



<p>You really don&#8217;t have to travel to act like a tourist. Wild, don&#8217;t you think? Act like a tourist with the little things around you and let their normalcy exhilarate you. Also, do yourself a favor and take the negative connotation out of the word &#8220;normal&#8221;. your normal has its own beauty, keep telling yourself that. Gratitude for the little things is the shortest ride to happier days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be easier on yourself.</h2>



<p>As a golden rule of thumb, dont take yourself so seriously!</p>



<p>Realize that you’re not the only one on a journey; you are a small part of a much bigger picture. It’s not all on you, and you are not alone. Especially in 2020, everyone’s just trying to FIGURE. IT. OUT. Allowing yourself to be nicer to yourself, pandemic or not, can also open multiple doors towards a gratitude-filled life.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be a cheerleader (mostly figuratively)</h2>



<p>Watching your friends&#8217; success can be one of the ebst feelings in the world. So be their hype man. Push them, root for them and be there when need a little pick me up. Being a part of someone else&#8217;s happiness can help add to yours. And gives you yet another reason to feel gratitude in your days.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be as present as you can.</h2>



<p>Yeah, this was all over the internet this year and the last and you might call it a cliché but, being present means allowing yourself to not waste your time over things that don&#8217;t matter. And your time is the most important thing. Be in the here and in the now and don&#8217;t spend too long thinking about the fact that your boss can sometimes forget everything we&#8217;re dealing with collectively as the human race.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take some risks and then some more.</h2>



<p>Amazing things can happen outside of your comfort zone. Everything in life is either a lesson or a blessing. What might feel like a mistake, is just proof that you tried! It’s your one life to live, so make it a great story. You don’t want to look back on your life with a tally of things you wish you had done.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Marie Kondo your mind</h2>



<p>No we don&#8217;t mean forget everything unwanted but that is also kind of what we mean. There&#8217;s a million things to keep up with everyday. But if we all got rid of the clutter in our heads, can you imagine what the world would look like? Starting each day with a clean slate is as important as making sure you&#8217;re out of the house catching some fresh air at least for 1/24 hours in your day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let yourself look forward to things</h2>



<p>Whether it’s your cat’s birthday tomorrow or a vacation in 6 months, have something to prep for and get excited about! Having something on your agenda to look forward to makes every day a little more compelling. Even if it&#8217;s a very materialistic thing, keep yourself engaged. This becomes a very important aspect in maintaining a sense of normalcy. Especially in times when we&#8217;re dealing with a global crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic, gratitude can and must be practiced in the smallest of things.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do. Not. Give. Discounts. On. Your. Worth.</h2>



<p>Knowing your worth and value are key in getting to know yourself and being nicer to yourself. Practice self-love, know your value, and never settle for less. Know when to leave the table if respect is no longer being served. You are the only you, and you need to be taken care of, a one-of-a-kind piece.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Open thy mind</h2>



<p>The world turned upside down in a lot of respects in 2020. There was immense pain and the a gaping need for healing. There has truly been no better time to move past shades in our mind. don&#8217;t stop yourself from growing, and promise yourself to see and learn something new everyday. That&#8217;s all.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let yourself slow down</h2>



<p>And finally, know when to slow down and know when to walk away. Give yourself the gift of a couple extra deep breaths, get in your car for a coffee run and blast your favorite tunes. Squeeze in some time for an extra walk and slow down and enjoy your day.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s wishing you a very fruitful 2020 to you, dear reader. Thanks for your time!</p>

<p>Before we begin, stop and take a deep breath. Straighten your spine and unclench your jaw. Yep, let&#8217;s begin. </p>



<p>2020 was the year of a lot of highs and many lows, but history will remember this year as the year of the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://combatcovid.hhs.gov/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=mmg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. (But also the year Trump left the White House after a single run <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/263a.png" alt="☺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). The response to the pandemic has been a difficult one globally.</p>



<p>The US alone averaged at extremely high rates of cases as well as the people we lost. Meanwhile, the world found itself amidst the climate change emergency as well.</p>



<p>However, recovery from this year wouldn&#8217;t just mean the introduction and availability of a vaccine. It would also mean policy changes. As well as a guided transition into a pandemic free world in conjunction with medical experts, scientists, and economists alike.</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s complex times, it becomes difficult to gauge the weight on the shoulders of an individual. Especially a young one, trying to make ends meet, provide for themselves and their family and navigate a pandemic. But recovery from this year wouldn&#8217;t just mean recovering from the pandemic. It would also need to mean individual recovery.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not promising that the following will aid the healing of all your wounds. But they might make your days a little better. So, maybe, give it a shot and see if some of them help.</p>

<p>Yep, taking note of the many small things that make life what it is, is a great way to feel gratitude. It also helps break the rut we find ourselves in every day.</p>



<p>Take a second to watch the lake you drive by. Take a picture of the bird that comes and sits on your balcony or the way the sunlight hits your kitchen counter. Nature should be the last thing we take for granted, as it&#8217;s the shortest route to any recovery.</p>

<p>Yep, you heard us right. We really think it&#8217;s time to let go of posting on social media as per highest traffic times, what gets more likes, etc. Because that rarely ever translates into sustained happiness.</p>



<p>Tell yourself your social media is for you, before anyone else. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you post something that others don&#8217;t like. Treat your social media as your memory album. It can be more, but only when that more pleases your being.</p>



<p>Not to sound cheesy but, nothing is ever too big or too small. Allow yourself to enjoy your scrolling. Fill your feed with people and content that make you feel good.</p>



<p>Checking your social media platforms shouldn’t be a chore for any of us! Help yourself by eliminating the immediate blockages to your healing process.</p>

<p>Recover from the pandemic by prepping your body for the day it is about to take on, with a glass of hot water (not boiling, of course). And your mind with things you are grateful for. Make a mental list of the things you&#8217;re grateful for — even if it&#8217;s just a couple. Then see how your mood changes for the better! (You can always get yourself a gratitude journal as well.)</p>

<p>If you feel something that hurts, and it makes you sob until snot bubbles form, embrace it. If you came across a hilarious joke that literally makes you want to howl, go ahead!</p>



<p>Don’t stunt your emotions; nobody can stop you from expressing yourself. Kneecapping your emotions can be a burden — but letting go is absolutely essential in your journey to healing and allowing yourself to just be!</p>

<p>No one expects you to do <em>everything.</em></p>



<p>No one. Understand your limits and do yourself (and those close to you a favor) and avoid reaching burnout as much as possible.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t yet have that quarantine bod? Don&#8217;t have as much saved as your thought you would? Learn to note the progress you have made still, and how far you have come from the starting point. If you take a step back and can see that you’re in a better place than you once were, that’s all that matters.</p>

<p>Noting things down has an incomparable beauty in itself. And it is only human to forget the things we swore we wouldn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>Recovering from the pandemic will require active work on all our parts. And this is one of the most helpful ways of recognizing your feelings before you begin to process them.</p>



<p>Remembering every single thought we had is impossible. It really is. So do yourself a favor, and note it down. In whatever form you think is best.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take up the things you liked as a child.</h2>

<p>Sure we were all locked in this past year — but so many people took up childhood activities again! From puzzles, to painting, and making pillow forts. There&#8217;s a ton of activities people found comfort in this past year, in their own journey of recovering from the pandemic.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s so much we loved as kids and let go of as we grew older. Find those things again and yourself, through them! From making Christmas villages to taking pictures, to collecting bottle caps and making elaborate houses out of cards, go wild!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living with roommates is more than just split bills, rent and space. Unfortunately, this closeness brings with it a higher risk of transmitted infection during the pandemic. One of the most significant disagreements that roommates have in their cramped apartments is how to correctly social distance. Whatever your relationship with those humans you live with, establishing these 5 key rules can help you reduce both physical contact &#8211; and heated conflict.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Discuss boundaries while living with roommates</h2>



<p>Boundaries take on a new meaning and are critically important in a time like this. It may be that you and your roommate disagree on quiet hours and cleaning regimens during &#8220;normal&#8221; life, but a pandemic calls for some necessary changes. It&#8217;s healthy to maintain open communication with your roommates regarding social distancing and person-to-person interactions.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="281" data-attachment-id="10496" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/taking-coronavirus-precautions-with-roommates-roomi/attachment/pandemic-rules/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pandemic-rules.gif?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,281" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="pandemic-rules" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pandemic-rules.gif?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pandemic-rules.gif?fit=500%2C281&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pandemic-rules.gif?resize=500%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="roommates establishing boundaries during a pandemic" class="wp-image-10496"/></figure></div>



<p>Due to the health hazard that coronavirus presents, you and your roommates must read from the same page regarding social distancing and sanitizing. You can openly talk to your roommate if you feel uncomfortable with the idea of them stepping out often and meeting people for leisure. </p>



<p>One common problem is having to deal with your roommate&#8217;s significant other spending more time in your apartment. Be honest and open about your apprehensions with your roommate. It&#8217;s a good idea to set a few healthy boundaries while living with roommates so that both of you feel secure in your home.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Make a pact to stay home</h2>



<p>Being serious about staying home means no family visits, no vacations, and no balcony parties. You can consider putting it down in a roommate agreement for the benefit of all your housemates. If your roommates do not take this seriously, explain the consequences to them. The coronavirus pandemic doesn&#8217;t look at age, gender, or financial stability. It can happen to anyone &#8211; regardless of where they live and what their living situation is like. The least you can do for yourself and the people around you is practice social distancing and regularly sanitize your hands whenever you go out.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Come up with a contingency plan to stay safe </h2>



<p>Be prepared in advance! You should devise a contingency plan in case any of you gets affected by the coronavirus. Even if you&#8217;re practicing strict safety measures, it&#8217;s still possible to contract the virus, especially if one of you is an essential worker.</p>

<p>Think about what you&#8217;ll do&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-to-do-if-your-roommate-has-covid-symptoms-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">if someone falls ill</a>?

What about washroom visits? Will this person be allowed kitchen visits? Or will a roommate leave meals outside their bedroom door?</p>



<p>This conversation while living with roommates could be uncomfortable and scary, but it&#8217;s necessary. If you have a small apartment, your plan needs to be very creative, possibly with one roommate leaving the apartment altogether. The conversation should include finances; maintain an open dialogue with your landlord and consider requesting a payment extension if you&#8217;re facing financial issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Living with roommates calls for a cleaning schedule</h2>



<p>With COVID-19 pandemic raging, promote new routines, especially if your roommates go weeks without Clorox. Choose one day of the week to&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/deep-clean-and-sanitize-your-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep clean and disinfect</a>&nbsp;and share the responsibility while living with roommates.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to designate a space for dirty shoes, clothes, and items. You can immediately remove all your keys, phone, shoes, and clothes as you come back from the supermarket and prevent bacteria from tracking the entire apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Designate individual spaces for work</h2>



<p>Some roommates in the apartment may be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doorsteps.com/articles/working-from-home-without-a-home-office-6-ways-to-maximize-productivity" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">working from home</a>, and it&#8217;s wise to designate a suitable workspace in your apartment.</p>



<p>If someone is continuously on their phone, it may be worthwhile to give them a room with a door. You may also need to establish quiet hours. Try to keep an open mind and remain flexible, as the pandemic situation is temporary and will soon subside.</p>

<p>The spread of COVID-19 continues to have unpredictably adverse impacts across the world. The United States, much like the rest of the world, has suffered an exponential loss. This applies to the housing market and regulations followed by property managers.</p>



<p> Experts believe that the changes adopted, as we shifted to the “quarantine economy”, will have a long-term impact. The complete extent of these changes is yet to be predicted. While the reality of eviction has been met with several governance policies, there are only a handful of policies that provide renters with the safety they hope for.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Changes_to_rent,_mortgage,_eviction,_and_foreclosure_policies_in_response_to_the_coronavirus_(COVID-19)_pandemic,_2020#States_that_implemented_policies_related_to_evictions_or_home_foreclosures" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">states protecting renters</a> through moratoriums, suspending evictions and foreclosures, there has been a notable decline in the population actively searching for new homes to rent. This changed the dynamics of the housing market. To create a demand for the same, property managers and renters’ apartment associations have to make their properties stand apart by “pandemic proofing” it.</p>



<p>The pandemic, property managers say, has forced them to make certain tweaks. Some stand hopeful that the pandemic may no longer be an issue for instance in 2024, when projects are completed.  However, none are shying away from providing a list of well- equipped amenities. As that would provide the renter with an increased sense of security at least. </p>

<p>Gloves and masks for all employees at the building is going to become the norm and cleaning is going to take on a whole new meaning in apartment buildings.</p>

<p>Limit on the number of people that can enter an elevator at once.</p>



<p>Ample supply of hand sanitizers across the building. Some might install fancier dispensers that come with multiple types of sanitizers.</p>

<p>Limited office hours / shifting to an online administration system entirely.</p>



<p>Pre-booking of common-area spaces via apps available to those living in that particular building. For instance, properties like Gotham West in Manhattan require their tenants to use an app called Amenity Boss &#8211; created during the lockdown for tenants to reserve outdoor time.</p>



<p>Virtual collection of bills and rent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-transformation-of-the-building-structure">Transformation of the building structure</h3>



<p>Decks are now the hot commodity &#8211; many buildings (Eg: Astoria Lights, a Co-Op in Queens) might soon extend their roof to double its original size after the pandemic made their dock extra popular.</p>



<p>Alchemy properties, set to start sales on the Upper West Side this fall, are opting for copper in place of steel because studies claim the virus does not live on copper as long as it does on steel. Increased use of copper for handles, gym equipment, etc. is to be expected but at a highly inflated price as copper costs 6 times more than steel.</p>



<p>Social distance gyms will also follow suit. Ashland, a Brooklyn rental, has unplugged every other treadmill they have so runners don’t get too close. To make up for the time lost, their gyms are now open 24/7.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-less-shifting-and-house-mobility">Less Shifting And House Mobility</h3>



<p>People have been generally apprehensive of moving out amid infection concerns &#8211; this poses as one of the biggest threats to the housing market which thrives on people shifting houses. Until we see a vaccine approval close on the horizon, moving will remain a concern restraining people from the market. </p>



<p>However, once we’re past the peak, those wanting a safer housing environment will definitely find themselves doing so. Many construction and upgrading projects might be postponed by property managers instead of facing a complete shutdown.</p>

<p>Affordability in the housing market, this past decade, has been somewhat of a white whale for most of us. Studies claim that in 2019 alone, a quarter of all renters spent half their yearly income on rent. But with the pandemic and current governance policies, available homes and moving families might both become a rarity. So while competitor rates in some localities might cause rents to fall, this might only be a short term phenomenon. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-housing-inequality">Housing Inequality</h3>



<p>Income inequality in the U.S. has been exponentially exaggerated in the past decade. Close to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/28-million-americans-face-eviction-because-they-cannot-afford-rent.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">28 million Americans</a> faced evictions this year alone. While the richer have witnessed their housing market prices fall, the bottom 10% has witnessed a sharp incline. The pandemic’s economic trends are likely to make this gap bigger, this paves a profit for property managers. Thus, the future for renters looking to eventually own a home seems much tougher. </p>

<p>Following the Great Recession, part of the reason behind construction recovery has been the demanding nature of luxury housing. These property managers offer high-end facilities to those that are willing to pay more. This particular communities in the housing market promises to make their lives better, with higher pay. </p>



<p>Permissions handed to Multifamily Units in the past three years passed a thirty year high. These facilities will continue to offer an exquisite inventory to those willing to seek long-term refuge in their offerings.</p>

<p>The past months have made a notable dent in the average millennial’s savings. Those hoping to own a home soon might have to shift expectations and delay home ownership even further. This is because home values are expected to decrease due to low supply of available homes and decreased mobility of homeowners. However, some are considering opportunities abroad, with &#8220;<a href="https://www.karenrealestate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">properties in Costa Rica</a>&#8221; becoming an appealing option for those seeking affordable investments and lifestyle changes in Central America.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the NYC Lockdown in place, we at Roomi found ourselves in an unfamiliar state of flux. In 2020, we found the entire world locked in their homes, only stepping out for essentials. But we also found ourselves confused about what the term &#8220;essential&#8221; really means. </p>



<p>2020 also brought us to terms with the idea that we&#8217;re now living in an era where rules are constantly changing. Be it the NYC lockdown caused by disease or other reasons. The point is that things are changing.</p>



<p>2020 also became the year with so many new rules governing how we live. How can we tell if we&#8217;re breaking the law by doing something as simple as shopping?</p>



<p>The question we&#8217;re answering today is, what does a lockdown in NYC look like? What were some of the key inferences of the NYC lockdown of 2020? Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the NYC lockdown put in place on March of 2020, with the pandemic at its peak.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Matilda&#8217;s Law: the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of a lockdown in NYC.</h2>



<p>In March of 2020, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-new-york-state-pause-executive-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Cuomo put the state “on pause”</a>, effectively instating the NYC lockdown. This meant that all non-essential businesses were shutting down until further notice. And non-essential workers were to work from home as of March 22nd.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.news10.com/news/ny-news/matildas-law-know-the-rules-to-stay-safe/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Cuomo introduced “Matilda’s Law”, which is designed to protect New York’s most vulnerable members of the population</a>. This includes those above 70, those with a poor immune system, and those with underlying health issues. The law prevents this group from leaving their homes and limits visitation to only their immediate family.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Visiting the elderly and immunocompromised.</h3>



<p>By law, you&#8217;re allowed to visit an elderly or <a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2020/may/what-it-means-to-be-immunocompromised" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunocompromised</a> individual. But the law also demands you undertake a temperature test and visit when you&#8217;re showing no flu-like symptoms. You should also wear a mask and gloves for your visit. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shopping for groceries during a lockdown in NYC.</h3>



<p>It’s best to keep visits to the grocery store to a minimum, but we’ve all gotta eat. If possible, plan two weeks in advance to avoid having to make extra visits. However, this doesn’t mean hoarding food or supplies!</p>

<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-new-york-ny-update-news/6032843/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The guidance is that New Yorkers can go out to buy food or essential supplies, which includes medicine. </a>If more than one person lives at home, consider taking it in turns to buy what you need, to keep bodies in the stores to a minimum. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">? <strong>Keep your distance, and wipe the handle of your grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe. Remember to wash your hands when you get home.</strong></pre>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Getting some outdoor exercise when there&#8217;s a lockdown in NYC</h3>



<p>It’s natural to feel like you’re going stir-crazy when you’re stuck inside. Cabin fever is real and it hit all of us pretty hard. And with gyms closing across the state, how can you make sure you’re staying fit and healthy? The good news is you can go to the park for a walk or jog &#8211; or even to just get some fresh air.</p>

<p>Make sure you maintain a 6 feet distance between you and anyone else that doesn’t live in your house. For some extra peace-of-mind, avoid touching surfaces outside such as benches, pull-up bars and the button on stop lights. It’s best to avoid drinking from water fountains. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/well/live/coronavirus-contagion-spead-clothes-shoes-hair-newspaper-packages-mail-infectious.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Experts agree that it’s not necessary to change clothes or take a shower when you return home, but only for those who are taking strict social distancing measures.</a></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">? <strong>If you’re showing flu-like symptoms and are self-isolating, you must stay at home. Consider resting but if you must get in a work-out, sign up for some online training videos.&nbsp;Or just try some indoor jump rope!</strong></pre>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Visiting friends during a lockdown in NYC</h3>



<p>Unfortunately not. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/taking-coronavirus-precautions-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unless you’re one of the lucky ones and you live with your friends, an NYC lockdown means it&#8217;s the time to cancel all dinner parties, and other gatherings</a>. Social distancing means that you can only see other people in essential scenarios. This could be to offer medical assistance, buy food or exercise outdoors.</p>

<p>Well, the pandemic in New York is getting worse by the minute. As of March 17th, there were at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/new-york-coronavirus-cases-governor-andrew-cuomo" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">1374 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York</a>, with over 4000 cases across the US. Because the virus has spread across 100 countries, The World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">(WHO) has officially characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic</a>. A Pandemic can be defined as “the worldwide spread of a new disease”. As things get worse, a lot of us are asking ourselves how we can stay safe during NYC Coronavirus Pandemic.</p>



<p>Roomi is dedicated to the health and well-being of our community. Because, we’ve seen a lot of false information circulating online about COVID-19, we thought we&#8217;d set the record straight. So, we’ve carried out our own research from reputable sources. And we&#8217;ve brought to you 5 things you need to know during the NYC coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. State of emergency</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/03/13/new-york-city-state-of-emergency-de-blasio-says-schools-and-mass-transit-will-stay-open/#fb193886af1d" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayor de Blasio has declared a state of emergency in New York City</a>. In a press conference on March 12th, he predicted that the coronavirus,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p> “could easily be a 6-month crisis” </p></blockquote>



<p> He also expected the number of cases to continue to rise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This emergency will allow the government to establish curfews, ration supplies and order people off the streets where appropriate. All of which can be helpful when trying to deal with the pandemic in New York. </p>



<p>But despite his concerns, he was adamant at the time that schools and public transport would not be affected. He said </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“we are going to fight tooth and nail&#8230;do our damnedest to keep the schools open.&#8221; </p></blockquote>



<p>de Blasio’s reasoned that kids need meals. Moreover, the parents need a place that can care for their children while they go to work.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ban on gatherings of 500+ people because of the pandemic in New York</h2>



<p>On March 12th, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned until further notice. He has also said that venues with a capacity of less than 500 will have to halve that number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only exceptions to the rule are hospitals, nursing homes and mass transit. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This ban will obviously change day-to-day life for all New Yorkers. For example, bars and restaurants will have to reduce the number of patrons they serve. This ban has also led to cancellation of concerts all over the city. Tourists that visit us for our vibrant culture will be reduced for a while to cope with the pandemic in New York.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-shutdown.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Last Sunday saw the closure of the city&#8217;s public school system</a>. COVID has also forced bars and restaurants across the state to shut down. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The subway is still open despite the pandemic in New York</h2>



<p>Mayor de Blasio has expressed has said that he would like to keep some things the unchanged. Despite the pandemic in New York becoming worse. The subway is a primary focus here; Mr. de Blasio sees public transit as the foundation of the local economy and a vital resource for working people.</p>



<p>On Thursday he said, “if it’s not coming from my mouth, don’t believe it.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper relaxed"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">THERE IS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA:<br><br>ONE TWEET IN PARTICULAR IS FALSE. CONTRARY TO WHAT IT SAYS THERE ARE NO PLANS BY THE NYPD TO SHUT DOWN ROADWAYS OR SUBWAYS.</p>&mdash; NYPD NEWS (@NYPDnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/1238195296250847233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 12, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The NYPD has plans in place to protect New York’s residents</h2>



<p>The NYPD is not only taking to Twitter to dispel myths, it’s also taking precautions. They&#8217;re also changing how it responds to emergencies and non-emergencies during NYC Coronavirus Pandemic. For instance, <a href="https://apnews.com/af8e6e9b265d5f0fa7a29f6ceaa287db" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">department has issued guideline </a>on how to deal with interactions with people showing signs of the virus. Additionally, more gloves, masks and hand sanitizer have been given out to adequately deal with the pandemic in New York.</p>



<p>Union president Pat Lynch said in a statement- </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“No matter how this pandemic progresses, New York City police officers will remain on the front lines and will continue to carry out our duties protecting New Yorkers&#8230;But we shouldn’t be forced to do so without adequate protection.”</p></blockquote>



<p>At the time of writing this blog, no NYPD officers have been confirmed to have contracted COVID-19. However, that might change if the virus begin to affect manpower. For example, switches to 12-hour rotations will be put in place to deal with the pandemic in New York.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. You can take steps to help slow the spread of COVID-19</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of good that can come from all of us following the protocols put in place. Protect yourself and others during the pandemic in New York by taking the following precautions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water</li><li>Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze</li><li>Don’t touch your face with unwashed hands</li><li>Don’t shake hands with others</li><li>Monitor your health for cold and flu-like symptoms</li><li>Stay at home if you feel any symptoms.
