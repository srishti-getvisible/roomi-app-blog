<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-sunnyside-in">2. Sunnyside in</h2>



<p>While you want your space to be cozy, it&#8217;s still important to let fresh air and sunlight into your apartment every day. The best time to do take up this apartment cozying idea is during the late afternoon when the sun rays will warm up your apartment <em>and</em> keep it looking fresh and bright.</p>



<p>Open up the curtains and windows for a couple of hours during the day to bring in some natural heat before the evening comes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-shut-santa-s-doorway">3. Shut Santa&#8217;s doorway</h2>



<p>If you still believe in Santa, we&#8217;re sorry to inform you that he&#8217;s probably not coming this year&#8230; Anyway! Keep your chimney blocked when you&#8217;re not using them in order to prevent heat loss. If you can, cover it up with a cardboard or wood board to keep any breeze from coming in. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/diy-christmas-decorations-a-hygge-experience-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you have a non-working fireplace, try decorating it with candles, perfect for warm and inviting nights on the couch.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-soft-bedding-warm-bedding-and-maybe-a-little-ball-of-fur">4. Soft bedding, warm bedding, and maybe a little ball of fur</h2>



<p>Apart from your soft, warm kitty, we recommend switching up your bedding to winter bedding that&#8217;s soft and warm. If you don&#8217;t have different bedding, it&#8217;s time to get your bedding shop on! During winter, it&#8217;s all about the warmth anyway! Get bonus cozy points with extra throw pillows, wool knit shawls, bed covers, or blankets.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-let-your-lights-take-inspiration-from-the-sun">5. Let your lights take inspiration from the sun</h2>



<p>Anything to remind you of the warm sun on the cold winter nights, right? Switch to subtle yellow light bulbs to make your bedroom look extra cozy and inviting. Decorate your apartment with beautiful lamps or hang fairy lights all around for the festive, winter season. This is also one of those cozy apartment beautifying ideas that work across seasons!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-enhance-your-kitchen-environment">6. Enhance your kitchen environment</h2>



<p>One of our favorite places to be during the cold winter months? The kitchen of course! <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/10-life-lessons-learned-from-cooking-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luckily, there&#8217;s no need to drain your savings or spend a lot of time achieving a cozy kitchen environment. </a>With a few simple touches, you can easily enhance your kitchen with some truly festive winter vibes. Incorporate copper gadgets and wooden tools as they will help to create a warm feeling in your space, and include candles for that &#8216;fireside feel&#8217;.</p>



<p>Make a list of ingredients for recipes (particularly baked goods!), and make space for all your munchies using our favorite kitchen storage hack and hang your pots and pans on the wall.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-the-warmth-of-diy">7. The warmth of DIY</h2>



<p>There are things you might not want to spend money on and that is okay because DIY can be a lot of fun!</p>



<p>For heavy curtains &#8211; why not try adding a thermal lining yourself? <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-simple-diy-repairs-for-your-home-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our blog on DIY hacks,</a> we covered some things you&#8217;d want to take up over the weekend. For that homely smell that only the festive season can bring, you could try natural ways to make your home smell good &#8211; think dried cinnamon in a bowl.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing better than using things you made with your own hands, and the art of DIY will keep you warm and active during the lazy winter months.</p>



<p>Stay warm, y&#8217;all!</p>
