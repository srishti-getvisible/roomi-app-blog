										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So, you&#8217;re living with a roommate who has an eating disorder and you don&#8217;t know what to do. Well, first of all, give yourself on the back because you&#8217;re doing a great job. Finding out more about people with eating disorders to help your roommate shows them that you care. Your involvement also indicates that you understand how your roommate must be feeling and what they might be going through emotionally. But before we go any further, there are a few things you should know about people suffering from eating disorders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is an eating disorder? </h2>



<p>You will hear from most people that an eating disorder is not a disorder. Or that it&#8217;s just about losing weight and looking good. But the fact is that every person has a deeply unique experience when it comes to their eating disorder (ED). Now that you live with a roommate who has an eating disorder, you should be sensitive about how you speak of their illness. Remember also the fact that the person suffering from this <strong>doesn&#8217;t have a choice;</strong> it&#8217;s a mental illness that needs diagnosis and medical care. If you or your roommate are suffering from ED, know that it&#8217;s nothing to be ashamed about, seek medical help, and let someone know (someone you trust) about how you feel. With the right support from family and friends, it is possible to come out of this experience fully recovered.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think people realize, when they&#8217;re just getting started on an eating disorder or even when they&#8217;re in the grip of one, that it is not something that you just &#8220;get over.&#8221; For the vast majority of eating-disordered people, it is something that will haunt you for the rest of your life. You may change your behavior, change your beliefs about yourself and your body, give up that particular way of coping in the world. You may learn, as I have, that you would rather be a human than a human&#8217;s thin shell. You may get well. But you never forget.&#8221;</p><cite>â€• Marya Hornbacher,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1256238" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia</a></cite></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are a few things to keep in mind if you&#8217;re <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-roommate-eating-disorder/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living with someone with an eating disorder:</a></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Take time to listen to them, and avoid giving advice or criticism</li></ul>



<p>Just because your roommate has an eating disorder, doesn&#8217;t mean you get to lecture them. This can be tough as you might disagree with their life choices and eating habits. But, keep in mind that you don&#8217;t need to know all the answers. Ensuring that they know that you are there for them is essential. So that your roommate doesn&#8217;t feel the need to reject your help, friendship, or support.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Build up their self-esteem</li></ul>



<p>Let them know they are a great person and that you&#8217;re happy to have them in your life. They might not want to go out or join in with regular activities, but you should keep stretching your extended hand of care and love. They will still appreciate being asked to join in social events. Even if they do not accept, it will make them feel valued as a person. That&#8217;s what living with a roommate is all about- supporting each other in their time of need.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How are eating disorders treated?</h2>



<p>Eating disorder&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eating-disorders/in-depth/eating-disorder-treatment/art-20046234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatments are varied</a>&nbsp;depending on the exact nature of the eating disorder. Treatment usually involves talking/counseling therapy, to improve the patient&#8217;s relationship with food and get to the root of the disorder. If your roommate has an eating disorder, it would be a good idea to take them to a therapist first.</p>



<p>Prescriptions hover around a combination of psychotherapy, nutrition education, medical monitoring, and sometimes medications. It also involves addressing other allied health problems that could be serious or even life-threatening if they go untreated for long. Your roommate could need hospitalization if the disorder does not improve with standard treatment or causes more extreme health problems.</p>



<p>The therapist will encourage your roommate to talk about the emotional issues that led to their eating disorder. They will also learn healthier ways to cope with these feelings. So, you might have to monitor your roommate&#8217;s self-help program. Since the treatment takes place over weeks, it provides time for your roommate to make changes slowly. An early start ensures better chances of a good recovery.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should your roommate go to the hospital?</h2>



<p>If your roommate has an eating disorder, they might need hospitalization. But that&#8217;s only reserved for extreme cases. However, most patients get treated as outpatients, and they are required to visit the hospital one day a week. Keep in mind, that the frequency of hospital visits depends on the severity of the case.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should you visit your roommate in the hospital?</h2>



<p>The prime goal is to let them know you&#8217;re thinking of them and would like to visit them. So, visitations will depend on the treatment center rules and what your roommate wants. If visits are not possible, you can always call, text, or leave a voice note letting them know you&#8217;re still there to support them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is it okay to force my roommate to get help with an eating disorder?</h2>



<p>If your roommate has an eating disorder, it&#8217;s possible they&#8217;ve lost a lot of weight. If that&#8217;s the case, they are in danger of starving themselves and developing severe complications. It&#8217;s possible that they may not be able to think clearly because of the lack of food. If this has been going on for too long, they might even require life-saving treatment. If you think this might be happening, you should reach out for medical help ASAP!</p>

<p>They say that it takes 21 days to form habits. What! Just 21 days? So, that means change is possible! But when thinking about breaking a routine can make us feel like it&#8217;s an impossible journey, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been struggling with this for ten years. How will I ever overcome it?&#8221; The ultimate answer &#8211; you need to be super intentional. If you can consciously choose and have a challenge written out on a piece of paper to stick it in ten different places, you continuously remind yourself about it. Remember, it&#8217;s all about the small choices you make every day that can help you break bad habits. Even when they are bad eating habits like over eating and mindless snacking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9 Questions to ask yourself to determine the source of your bad eating habits!</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Are you a heavy snacker?</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/l44QwkaFyR4dqF2nK"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/l44QwkaFyR4dqF2nK/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C240&#038;ssl=1" alt="Yas Yes GIF by SkinnyPop - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="240" /></a></div>

<p>You could be overeating. A small healthy snack between meals is fine. Snacks can keep blood sugar steady. When you snack instead of having real meals, you are more likely to lose track of how much you are eating. Since a small serving of snacks is not that satisfying, it is easy to overeat.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to avoid getting &#8216;snacky&#8217;?</h4>



<p>To satisfy your hunger and keep your energy up, allow yourself to have two&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/cheap-and-healthy-snack-ideas-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-calorie snacks</a>&nbsp;a day of 100 to 300 calories each. Have something that feels like real food, e.g., half a sandwich, a handful of nuts, whole-grain crackers, baby carrots with hummus, or yogurt sprinkled with cereal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Are you a mindless muncher?</h3>



<p>It could be the telly or mindless Netflix binge, but people who eat while watching the TV can take in about 20 to 60% more. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">How to break this eating habit? </h4>



<p>Figure out your trigger situations and set limits on what you will eat. Help yourself with a single serving before you sit down on the couch, or delay your snack until you can pay attention. Minimize damage by dipping into low-cal foods, such as cut vegetables, air-popped popcorn, rice crackers, and whole-grain cereal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Do you eat your way out of a bad mood?</h3>

<p>Many people turn to carbs that produce tryptophan, a type of amino acid used by the brain to manufacture serotonin. With the brain making more serotonin, your mood temporarily improves. Feeding your fears and frustrations, instead of confronting them, can lead to a cycle of worse moods and steady weight gain.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The solution!</h4>



<p>Stop thinking about what&#8217;s bothering you. Try a nonfood mood booster, like walking, watching a movie, or calling a friend. If nothing else works, get your serotonin boost without triggering a binge. Go for a whole-grain treat to get more fiber and less sugar.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Do you eat all week carefully, but blow it over the weekend with your eating habits?</h3>



<p>It is possible to undo five days of good eating with weekend binges. If you are consistent in your eating habits, you are 1.5 times more likely to stay within five pounds of your weight than those who are vigilant only on weekdays.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Fix your eating habits with this ??</h4>



<p>Don&#8217;t severely restrict yourself from Monday to Friday to feel the need to indulge on weekends. You can strategize your weekend socializing by having a &#8220;mini-meal&#8221; before you go out. You can even offer to be the designated driver for the day to limit alcohol intake.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Do all your meals come in cans, bags, or boxes?</h3>

<p>Most packaged foods can be sneaky sources of unhealthy fats, sugar, salt, and excess calories. Even a can of low-fat soup can contain more than half a day&#8217;s worth of sodium.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The solution!</h4>



<p>Be smart about it, not guilty for relying on packaged foods. Lower calorie or lower-sodium versions of frozen food can provide a quick controlled meal. Check labels to find the healthiest ones that are high in fiber and lower in salt, and have whole grains, nutrient-rich vegetables at the top of their ingredient lists. You can wrap up your meal with a piece of fruit or low-fat yogurt for dessert.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Do you eat on the run?</h3>



<p>You ignore what&#8217;s going into your mouth if you eat while driving, walking down the street, or shopping. It can mean an upset stomach and can leave you dissatisfied, unsure of what you ate that didn&#8217;t agree with you.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The solution!</h4>



<p>If you need to schedule a reminder, do it, but build time to eat into your day. When you don&#8217;t have the option,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi/1981/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come prepared</a>&nbsp;with a granola bar, nuts and dry fruits, and a single-serving packet of crackers. Store them in your bag, glove compartment of your car, or office drawer. Even fast-food joints are today offering healthy options for satisfying real food.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Are you a speed eater?</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>Gulping food makes you take in excess air, which can lead to bloating. Research says that it takes about 20 minutes for your brain to realize that your stomach is full. Consequently, a recent study concluded that women who ate within 30 minutes ate 10 percent fewer calories than those who finished their food in 10 minutes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Slow down with this eating habit!</h4>



<p>Avoid finger foods, and instead, choose items that require a plate to eat with utensils. Pause often, and&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.self.com/story/how-to-drink-more-water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drink water throughout meals</a>. Try to slow down.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Do you skip breakfast?</h3>



<p>Studies have shown that cognitive skills and memory improve once you&#8217;ve had breakfast. Blood sugar usually drops overnight, so the brain runs on empty until you eat in the morning. People who skip breakfast also lean on eating more calories during the day than do people who don&#8217;t.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The solution!</h4>



<p>If you are habitually short on time, you can stock&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.self.com/gallery/high-protein-breakfasts-that-arent-eggs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easy-to-make breakfast foods</a>. Keep packets of oatmeal handy in the office. Your breakfast need not be a drawn out affair, but you should aim to eat within an hour or two after getting up. Try to have around 250 &#8211; 400 calories and include at least one serving of whole grains, a protein source, and one serving of fruit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Is sugar your BFF?</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>A sugary snack provides very few nutrients and is mostly empty calories. Too much sugar can make you obese but also undernourished. Sugar gives that high energy but will slump you down later. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s what you ought to do ??</h4>



<p>Unsweetened dried fruits, peanut M&amp;M&#8217;s, and a handful of lightly sweetened whole-grain cereal are all excellent swaps for candy or cookies. This way, you don&#8217;t have to go off the sweet stuff altogether. Read labels and seek out less-sugar or sugar-free versions of your favorite food. This is primarily the most important aspect of fixing bad eating habits!</p>
