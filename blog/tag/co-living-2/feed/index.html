<p>For better or for worse, co-living with another person and sharing your living space can leave a lasting impact. The facts about roommates and co-living with them are that it’s not easy&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/9-reasons-why-living-with-a-roommate-is-awesome-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">but it does have its perks</a>.</p>



<p>Apart from companionship, co-living with a roommate helps you save money as you can split bills and other utilities with another person. So when you find yourself in a co-living situation, you need to be aware of the facts about roommates and the types of roommates and personalities that you’ll see.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-14-types-of-roommates-you-ve-probably-come-across">14 Types of Roommates You&#8217;ve Probably Come Across</h2>



<p>Here are 14 types of roommates you&#8217;re sure to come across, or have already had an encounter with in the past.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-the-neat-freak">1. The Neat Freak</h2>



<p>The neat freak comes with unexpected cleaning standards (think dust free picture frames and a labeled kitchen cabinet). These types of roommates are so dialled into the itty-bitty details, and it can be fun (for a time!), but if you’ve been living on a different planet and haven’t watched&nbsp;<em>Friends</em>, how will you learn about managing your real-life Monica Gellar at home?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s mostly easy to deal with the type of roommate who like things clean and organized. The trick is to make sure you do your part to keep common areas clean. You can trash your room all you want, but never let the mess go out of your own space. If you&#8217;re sharing the room, then your junk should only be on your bed.</p>



<p>Look at the bright side, appreciate your sparkling apartment, and do your bit to keep it looking beautiful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Clingy Roommates</h2>



<p>Making new friends is important, but some roommates tend to be too friendly that they become &#8216;clingy&#8217;. They invade your personal space and can even act as your shadow. Sharing a co-living space assumes a license for the clinger to be friends with your friends and go wherever you go.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make boundaries when living with a clinger</h3>



<p>With the clinger type of roommates, try to keep your private life private and don&#8217;t share too much. Be gentle in drawing lines, as they might throw a fuss and create a self-pity situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The Quiet One</h2>



<p>With this type of roommate, there aren&#8217;t any greetings and they don’t talk unless you ask them a question. They’re in and out of the house like a stealthy cat. Don’t expect more than a wave or a subtle nod from them.</p>



<p>When living with <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/4-tips-to-overcome-social-anxiety-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">quiet roommates</a>, it&#8217;s best to leave a written note if you wish to communicate.&nbsp;You&#8217;re actually considered lucky if you&#8217;re living with quiet roommates, as compared to some of the others in this list.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The Party Animal</h2>



<p>This is the type of roommate who never goes to class unless surrounded by fraternal brothers or sorority sisters. Their favorite time is late at night when they’re partying, and they come back home with a crowd of people. They&#8217;re the extroverted version of the clingers who are often shy.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make house rules that limit guests</h3>



<p>To deal with this type of roommate, talk to them about it in a matter of fact tone with no overkill. Social butterflies always have a crowd buzzing around them, so try to setting boundaries in the apartment. Maybe you could limit guests to only stay until a particular time in the night or to tone it down after 10 P.M. because we all need our beauty sleep.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The Lover</h2>



<p>Since you’ve started living with them you’ve seen a a record breaking number of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/what-to-do-dont-like-roommates-partner/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">individuals</a> walk out of their room every morning. And sometimes this type of roommate carries their display of affection outside their bedroom.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Try to avoid being embarrassed when living with the romantic type</h3>



<p>Living with a romantic type of roommate means you need to have an unspoken code before you walk in the room, like a hat on a doorknob. If you still happen to walk in on them during an awkward lip-smacking session (or worse), suggest that they should have date nights someplace else other than your crash pad. They&#8217;ll get the picture.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. The Passive Aggressive One</h2>



<p>One of the reasons people behave passive aggressively is the fear of direct display of anger. The way to communicate with them is to keep it simple and to be assertive. It’s best to avoid gossip and huffing and puffing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Keep a check on the words you use</h3>



<p>The best way to communicate with passive aggressive roommates is through written notes. In case their random notes surpass your patience levels, you can join them at their own game. Leave a post-it note: <em>“Had your leftover pizza as I was hungry. It was yummy.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Slobs</h2>



<p><a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/help-roomate-is-a-slob/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">The slobs</a> are one of the most difficult types of roommates to live with. They have no basic hygiene or cleaning habits. They’re easy to spot – think dirty clothes piled up, food wrappers, unwashed dishes, and always in need of a shower.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" data-attachment-id="21083" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/10-different-roommates-you-might-end-up-with-roomi/attachment/slobs/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?fit=2250%2C1500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2250,1500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Slobs" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="Slobs" class="wp-image-21083" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=1250%2C834&amp;ssl=1 1250w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Slobs.png?resize=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Source: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/young-woman-watching-movie-in-headphones-in-messy-room-3795291/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Pexels</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Honestly, you can’t really do anything about them</h3>



<p>One thing you need to know about slobs is that they make those choices consciously, so a conversation may not kick them into action. The best way to go around this is to create boundaries for their mess, and deal with them as you would with a reverse of the neat freak. If creepy crawlers are coming up to your space or if you cannot do without an odor mask, talk to your resident assistant (RA) or start looking for a new place.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Night Owls</h2>



<p>This type of roommate finds themselves most productive when everyone goes to sleep. The night owl roommate lives with you but has the routine of a resident country on the opposite side of the globe.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s nice about this type of roomie is if you need someone to wake you up in the middle of the night, you can count on them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. The Hermit</h2>



<p>The live-ins love their room so much that they probably don&#8217;t come out of there. They even skip class or work to watch TV or play a video game in peace. Hermits are similar to the quiet ones, but hermits value their privacy and personal space more. Usually, this type of roommate engages in solitary activities, like reading or doing their own hobbies in their own space.</p>



<p>The best way to deal with hermits is to tell them that you need space to study or work, relax, and have friends come over. Come up with a compromised way of space sharing. If you have separate bedrooms and rarely see this roommate, consider it a blessing. Just keep an eye out to see if your roommate&#8217;s still <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/spotting-telltale-signs-of-anxiety-in-your-roommate-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">doing okay or not.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Types of roommates who “borrow” a lot</h2>



<p>These are the type of roommates who like to “borrow” your things. The items may not be generally expensive, but the habit is annoying.</p>



<p>Try to be honest with your your roommate and tell them how their behavior makes you feel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Give them a taste of their own medicine</strong></h3>



<p>Else try and behave like them and text them, “Can I borrow your perfume?” It might help.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">11. The Athlete</h2>



<p>Having an athlete as a roommate can be good and bad. Good because you can be inspired to hit the gym or try out some new sports, and bad because there could be a lot of workout gear in the apartment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">12. Mother/Father Figure Roomie</h2>



<p>These types of roommates are always looking out for you. The Mother/Father figure always ask, &#8220;are you okay?&#8221;, &#8220;have you eaten?&#8221;, &#8220;why are you home late?&#8221;. But don&#8217;t get them wrong, they aren&#8217;t overbearing, they just genuinely care about you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">13. The Chef</h2>



<p>Living with an aspiring chef, or just a person who knows how to make gourmet chicken nuggets, will have you eating good at the apartment. The only downside is that the kitchen can get messy, and your roommate may need a helping hand. Another could be hearing pots and pans at three in the morning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">14. The Roommate Turned Bestie</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s not always that you get a roommate and best friend in one, but sometimes luck is just on your side. These types of roommates give you a feeling like you&#8217;ve known each other for years, when in reality, it&#8217;s only been a few months.</p>

<p>Living with your friend sounds like a dream … unless you’re planning on sharing a studio apartment. Can 2 people live in a studio apartment comfortably? See Roomi’s tips for sharing a small space!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sharing a Small Space with Your Friend</h2>



<p>Living with a roommate is not easy, even if they’re your friend. It involves a lot of adjustment, patience, and compromise. When you’re planning on sharing a studio apartment with a friend, it is important to set boundaries to ensure that you do not drive each other crazy. Staying organised, setting schedules, learning to respect boundaries and even getting privacy dividers …there are many innovative ways to make sharing a small space easier.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do you share limited space?</h2>



<p>Finding innovative ways to maximise limited spaces can help you live comfortably with your roommate, even in limited spaces. Looking for inspiration?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make the most of room dividers</h3>



<p>If you’re a fan of medieval dramas, you’ll be familiar with room dividers or privacy screens. They’re not just a fancy addition to a room &#8211; they can also help you demarcate specific areas in a small apartment. If you don’t want to invest in a room divider just yet, you can also strategically place rugs around the apartment to create cosy nooks!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Get creative with storage</h3>



<p>Finding enough storage space for one person is a feat in itself, but when you’re sharing a studio apartment with your friend, you need to get creative. Apart from the usual spaces, try to incorporate additional storage using hooks or buying multipurpose furniture.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stay organised</h3>



<p>When sharing a studio apartment, organisation is key. You cannot leave your things lying around as if you are living alone. And the best way to ensure that your roomie respects your space? Make sure that you are respecting theirs!</p>



<p>Pack away anything that you aren’t using, and try to reduce clutter as much as possible. Not only does this help your studio apartment seem more spacious, but it also helps you be a good roommate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can 2 people live in a studio?</h2>



<p>Disagreements are common, even when you’re living with your friends. When you’re sharing a small space, it is easy to get frustrated with the person you’re living with. So, how can you ensure that your co-living situation doesn’t turn into a nightmare?</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Set your boundaries</h3>



<p>Before you live together, make sure that there are definite boundaries in place. Decide who is going to pay for the utilities and who is going to do the grocery shopping ahead of time. Plus, you&#8217;ll want to discuss the ground rules for things like having guests over. Make sure that these rules are agreed upon before you move in.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Set a cleaning schedule</h3>



<p>No one likes to live in a messy environment. But when you’re sharing a studio apartment, things tend to pile up much quicker. It is best to set a cleaning schedule or spend a few minutes tidying up each day. Not only will this help to keep your apartment in good shape, but it can also help you bond with your friend.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Shop for décor and furniture together</h3>



<p>Buying décor and furniture together can be a fun roommate bonding experience, and it will help you avoid any disagreement. While you may have a vision for the place you’re living in, your roommate might not agree with you. Whenever you’re buying something for the studio apartment, make sure that you consult your roomie.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-co-living-communities">What are Co-living communities?</h2>



<p>Co-living communities are a modern, communal form of living. Here, each of the residents have their own personal room and shared communal spaces. They provide residents with a personal room and privacy like an apartment. However, the communal or common areas are shared by residents like in a dorm. They are particularly popular among students, young professionals, and digital nomads. <a href="https://und.edu/blog/what-is-an-msw-degree.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Master of Social Work</a> students find these communities ideal for fostering a sense of belonging and support, while still allowing them to maintain the privacy needed for their intensive studies and self-care routines.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-co-living-communities-right-for-me">Are Co-living communities right for me?</h2>



<p>Now that you have an understanding of co-living communities, it is time to see if they are right for you. While they do have a lot of benefits, they are not for everyone. Here are some points that will help you decide if co-living communities suit you or not.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-budgets-in-co-living-communities">Budgets in Co-living Communities</h3>



<p>Co living communities will almost always be cheaper than an apartment. While having a roommate could bring the costs down, co living spaces will save you more. If you are on a tight budget, you will be better off going with co living communities. With the rents in major cities soaring, they are a way to ease the pressure on the housing market.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-privacy-in-co-living-communities">Privacy in Co-Living Communities </h3>



<p>While you do share communal areas, co living communities give you your personal space. Thus, you and the other residents have your personal rooms. This gives you a lot more privacy compared to a dorm and can be important for some people. You will still need to share communal spaces and use common utilities. However, you can always retreat to your own room if you need a break or some &#8216;me time.&#8217;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-utilities-in-co-living-communities">Utilities in Co-Living Communities </h3>



<p>Another area where you save cash in co living communities is utilities. Here, all utility costs are generally included in the rent you pay. You and the other residents, all share the cost of utilities. As a result, you can expect to pay lesser for utilities as well as other facilities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amenities-in-co-living-communities">Amenities in Co-Living Communities </h3>



<p>Co living spaces will generally come with certain amenities that you can avail of. Some common amenities are free WiFi, a laundry room, a recreational area. Some dorms even have gyms and televisions for you to use. This makes it a hassle-free way to live without you having to worry about buying any appliances. You also do not need to head out every time you need something as all you need is generally there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cooking-in-co-living-communities">Cooking in Co-living Communities</h3>



<p>Depending on the place where you are putting up cooking may not be an option. As you share communal spaces in co living communities, there generally won&#8217;t be a full kitchen. While there may be a few appliances, it usually won&#8217;t be enough for you to cook full meals regularly. If you have special dietary requirements or just love cooking, do keep this in consideration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are few things that get as overwhelming as the search for a new home. There&#8217;s rent to think about and utility bills. And if you&#8217;re looking for living spaces in New York, there&#8217;s a high chance you&#8217;ve considered co-living in NYC as well. Co-living has become an extremely popular alternative to traditional housing options. It especially appeals to renters looking to save money! But also to those living spaces that come with a sense of community.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is co-living? Why is it so popular?</h2>



<p>The recent popularization of the affordable housing-startups has led to the rise in group housing for adults. And this is essentially what we refer to as co-living.</p>



<p>Co-living in NYC, as well as around the world, has taken many forms. We have witnessed the transformation of apartments as well as high-rise buildings. They&#8217;ve transformed into either dorms or single houses where groups of people live together!</p>



<p>Co-living housing often entails short-term or flexible leases. They include perks such as cleaning services, professionally furnished common areas, and turn-key amenities and utilities.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s also important to remember that while co-living, is a currently trending term. It may refer to this housing model we just mentioned, but it also has a broader meaning. And in a broader sense, this could mean anything from intentional communities where people live together, to just simply living with roommates.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/whats-coliving-like-when-youre-over-40/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi’s Guide To Senior Home Shares &amp; Having Roommates After 40!</a></strong></p>



<p>The reason why this structure has risen to such immense popularity in recent times is the ease it provides to those looking for it. Similar to co-working offices, co-living disrupted the traditional housing model by borrowing the concept of resource sharing. Tenants trade personal space for a fully furnished bedroom, shared common areas, and sometimes group social events, all under a predetermined cost structure. While residents still have to deal with security deposits, and income requirements, coliving has made house hunting in NYC significantly easier.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s now take a look at the perks of co-living in NYC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">With NYC&#8217;s rental prices, co-living comes in as a very affordable option.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/workaholics-season-5-episode-2-3o6wrAkOFwn1PUFyN2"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/3o6wrAkOFwn1PUFyN2/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Season 5 Episode 2 GIF by Workaholics - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Rent can be the biggest expenditure for a lot of us. New York in itself can be an expensive city to live in. So if you&#8217;re looking to save money, co-living in NYC is a great option to accomplish that.</p>



<p>But with living spaces, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/takeaways-from-an-iconic-coliving-relationship-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rent isn&#8217;t the only thing that makes our pockets sore.</a> Coliving, however, makes it slightly easier. Because even if you&#8217;re paying the security deposit and rent (which will be considerably lower than living alone), you&#8217;re still not paying for a couch, and wifi router!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Co-living in NYC comes with a ton of convenience.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/broadcity-season-3-episode-9-l1J9ROcCSp6ryQ8fu"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/l1J9ROcCSp6ryQ8fu/giphy.gif?resize=474%2C260&#038;ssl=1" alt="Im Gonna Be In And Out Season 3 GIF by Broad City - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="474" height="260" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Moving into a new house requires a lot of household management, which in turn, requires a lot of time and money. But with co-living spaces, you don&#8217;t have to set up utilities, schedule monthly bills for essentials like wifi, gas, electricity, and spend time decorating your entire house.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also the added benefit of sharing and negotiating chores with your roommates! Administration of living spaces in co-living settings takes a considerably short amount of time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Co-living comes with a built-in sense of community.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/new-girl-fox-new-girl-newgirl-3oxRmtwrHmE9QB46wU"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/3oxRmtwrHmE9QB46wU/giphy.gif?resize=500%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="New Girl On Fox GIF by New Girl - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="500" height="281" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Making friends as an adult is hard. But the great thing that comes along with living in a shared space, is that you always have a sense of having someone around if you need that. And then, familiarity breeds friendship like nothing else. And in no time, you who moved to a new city with no friends at all, will have found your circle!</p>



<p>Co-living in NYC particularly would mean living in a city like New York, and having a group of people who won&#8217;t just be having similar New York-ish experiences as you, but also might be well versed with the city in a way that could really benefit you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Co-living in NYC means lesser financial liability as opposed to a group lease!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/broadcity-season-4-episode-1-3ohhwyUHGfdyY4rPOM"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/3ohhwyUHGfdyY4rPOM/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C259&#038;ssl=1" alt="Season 4 Roommate GIF by Broad City - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="259" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Basically, you wouldn&#8217;t be harassing your roommates to reimburse you for the months they skipped on paying rent. You wouldn&#8217;t have to bother with paying your utility bills upfront. And! you won’t ever be on the hook to find a subletter for your roommate!</p>



<p>Sounds like a pretty sweet deal to us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Congratulations on finding yourself an apartment with nice roommates! You&#8217;re finally ready to move out and take on the responsibilities of making house rules and living arrangements. It&#8217;s exciting and filled with hopes and dreams of living your best life, becoming best buds with your roommate, and all the niceties that come with sharing an apartment.</p>



<p>But now you find yourself wondering, would you be able to truly be yourself with strangers around the house? Would you be able to feel at home when sharing an apartment?</p>



<p>While you&#8217;re thinking about things like these, one important thing to keep in mind is that a roommate relationship is usually a two-way street. And what you give, is what you get.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s take a look at a few crucial do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts when sharing an apartment with roommates for the first time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The DO&#8217;S when sharing an apartment</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Make and follow a roommate agreement</h3>



<p>Now, you must be wondering how to write an agreement for sharing an apartment. Does it have to be intense like Sheldon&#8217;s roommate agreement from The Big Bang Theory? Well, that depends, on how intense you and your roommates are as people.</p>



<p>Secondly, many people would think if you&#8217;re sharing an apartment with friends as roommates, you can probably forego an agreement. But you shouldn&#8217;t do that. An agreement will ensure your friendship stays intact. Additionally, it will help keep your roommate relationship and home environment sane.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So how should you write an agreement for sharing an apartment, and <a href="https://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/roommate-agreement-essential-topics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what should you include in it</a>?</h4>



<p>It all comes down to the basic chores and duties of being a roommate. Start with the rent and bills. Calculate who owes how much and when. Additionally, include clauses about pets, about calling people over, and the notice period that needs to be given before moving out. These should cover the most important house rules and living arrangements that need to be agreed on by all roommates when sharing an apartment. Further, you should feel free to add clauses that are important to you such as quiet time in the apartment, or the hours you don&#8217;t wish to be disturbed, etc.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Divide the chores</h3>



<p>The one thing that could wreak havoc in a peaceful shared apartment is not being able to manage house rules and living arrangements as a team. So it&#8217;s important as roommates to agree on who is in charge of what chore.</p>



<p>You could try a weekly chore division so that everyone gets to do something different each week. Or you could try to hand over permanent responsibility for a particular chore to each of the roommates if that&#8217;s something you all agree on.</p>



<p>Just remember to take everyone&#8217;s input so everyone knows and likes what they&#8217;re supposed to handle. And sharing an apartment is going to be a cakewalk from thereon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The DON&#8217;TS when sharing an apartment</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Cross boundaries</h3>



<p>Boundaries are very subjective and can differ from person to person. But the ones we&#8217;re talking about here involves basic house rules and living arrangements that make personal boundaries clear. Here are some of the basic boundaries you shouldn&#8217;t be crossing so you stay out of the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/annoying-habits-to-avoid-when-co-living-with-roomis-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">annoying roommate zone</a>.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Don&#8217;t go around snooping in your roommate&#8217;s rooms when they&#8217;re not around.</li>



<li>Try to not be too friendly, or totally antisocial when you&#8217;re starting out.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t make your roommates uncomfortable by having people over all the time, or an SO who never leaves.</li>



<li>Gossiping about your roommates behind their backs is a big no no.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t take their food or clothes without their permission.</li>
</ul>



<p>And whenever you can, pause and ask yourself how you would feel if you were at the receiving end. Trust that this will make sharing an apartment a lot easier.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Make an issue about everything</h3>



<p>Living with roommates with proper house rules and living arrangements in place is tough. They can easily get on your nerves, just for the reason that they&#8217;re around so much. But to be a good roommate, and get that treatment back in return, you need to make sure you try and nip things in the bud as often as you can.</p>



<p>So if certain roommate behaviors annoy you, try telling them straight away instead of keeping it all in and letting it explode the one day they leave their stuff lying around on the couch.</p>



<p>If your roommate&#8217;s habits interfere with your way of living, then, by all means, talk to them first and turn the conflict mode on if they don&#8217;t comply. But if their behaviors just activate the mild OCD in you, then try to let it go instead of constantly poking them.</p>



<p>In conclusion, when sharing an apartment with roommates, it&#8217;s best to have empathy for your roommates and try to look at the bright side of things as often as possible.</p>

<p>So to make your shared living space and roommate relationship tranquil, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/healthy-living-for-you-and-your-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">you need certain house rules to keep your home environment a sane, peaceful and less awkward one.</a></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s jump right to some of the rules you NEED to talk about if you&#8217;re starting to, or planning to co live with the opposite sex.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Think about what your co living relationship would be like</h2>



<p>Nothing&#8217;s stopping you from <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/top-7-movies-to-watch-on-netflix-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting cozy on the sofa with your roommate to watch a movie</a>, on a cold wintery night, especially in the middle of the pandemic. Humans get lonely, and your roommate is all you have in your shared apartment. We understand.</p>



<p>However, before you share an apartment with a roommate of the opposite sex, make sure you keep your intentions absolutely clear. We recommend discussing your personal relationships, expectations, and boundaries, to keep the sanity of your living space intact!</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-i-am-in-love-with-my-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you do fall in love with your roommate</a>, well, deal with it later. But it&#8217;s best to start out with the intention of a platonic relationship to avoid making co living messy.</p>

<p>And the same goes for men!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Establish co living boundaries</h2>



<p>To share an apartment with roommates peacefully, you need to establish certain boundaries about what&#8217;s allowed and what&#8217;s not.</p>



<p>What about the hair in the drain? The mess in the kitchen in your shared living space? And of course, knock, knock, knocking on your roommate&#8217;s door before entering should be a must!</p>



<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/new-girl-schmidt-go-on-2FaGi5y7T7xBK"></a></p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Niqulaz/" class="broken_link">Reddit user Niqulaz</a> suggests</p>



<p><strong><em>Get some ground-rules established fairly quick, like what&#8217;s an acceptable level of filthy for the kitchen, and what&#8217;s an acceptable amount of time to spend continuously occupying the bathroom. This will help immensely.</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Figure out the guest rules at your shared apartment</h2>



<p>Other than having your hot friends over for a party that will benefit you both, there would be times when they get their SO or dates over for a night in your shared apartment.</p>



<p>Make sure you discuss the rules beforehand to avoid any awkwardness in the future.</p>



<p>Can you get your respective SO&#8217;s and coochie coo with them on the couch in your shared living space? Can they be naked in the kitchen getting some OJ in the morning?</p>



<p>Establish these ground rules in your shared apartment. So you won&#8217;t be annoyed or embarrassed when something odd happens.</p>

<p>And of course, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shepsus/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Reddit user Shepsus</a> says, it&#8217;s knowing about your own preferences well.</p>



<p><strong><em>Guys would bring girls home, I&#8217;d meet them in the morning, or find them rummaging my fridge, no big deal really, have some OJ.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>But when I found a guy rummaging in my fridge wanting some of my OJ, I had an issue with it. I don&#8217;t trust random strange males. Yes, I should have the same apprehensiveness toward strange females, but I don&#8217;t.</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Practice open communication</h2>



<p>If it&#8217;s your first time co living with the opposite sex, you should anticipate and accept that awkward things might happen. So if and when you find something wrong, make sure you openly communicate with the other!</p>



<p>Make sure none of your concerns, or theirs are swept under the rug. Try to bond with them just like you would with any other roommate. This will make your co living conditions and shared living space comfortable!</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hammelltime/" class="broken_link">Reddit user Hammeltime</a> rightly suggests</p>



<p><strong><em>Ultimately, regardless of age and gender, some people are just better roommates than others. For me it&#8217;s about a 50/50 split between how many male and female roommates I&#8217;ve had and I can&#8217;t say I prefer one to the other.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Checking references and pre-interviewing roommates is about the best you can do to guarantee a quality roommate. Good luck</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We&#8217;ve learned a lot this year! One of the highlights though has been ironing out the rough edges of communal living in a shared living space. If you think your roomis are the best and you have no complaints, well, you&#8217;re one of the lucky ones!</p>



<p>However, when we practice communal living, it&#8217;s easy for certain habits to start getting to each other. So to make sure your shared living space stays happy and healthy, being a good roomi is essential.</p>



<p>Here are some habits that you should avoid when living with roomis in a shared living space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. In a shared living space &#8211; when you snooze, your roomis lose</h2>



<p>Do you hit snooze on your alarm at least 10 times before you wake up? Well, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qz.com/1637910/hitting-the-snooze-button-is-bad-for-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it&#8217;s bad for you</a> &#8211; as well as your roomis &#8211; in a shared living space. They might have a different sleeping schedule. And hearing that alarm tone over and over is never a good start to someone&#8217;s day.</p>



<p>So when living with roomis, stop snoozing those alarms to make communal living less cranky for everyone!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. You aren&#8217;t the eternally designated DJ in your shared living space</h2>



<p>We know this one stings. But the truth is: except for when it&#8217;s a party and you want to play DJ while everyone socializes and gets drunk, no one likes listening to your music all the time.</p>



<p>So when in a communal living situation, do your roommates a favor. Invest in a good pair of earphones or headphones to keep them sane. Even if your choice in music is outstanding, not everyone might want to listen to music when you do!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">RIP non headphone using roommates</h3>



<p>And when you do plug in your earphones, don&#8217;t sing along in your shared living space all the time. It might be cute for a while but can easily cross the line and enter the dreaded annoying zone!</p>

				</div>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The sound of discord</h2>



<p>So you&#8217;ve decided to pick up a new skill? And you&#8217;ve finally started taking online classes to learn the instrument you&#8217;ve always wanted to. Cheers to you! But we pity the roomis that are in a communal living situation with you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sound waves travel through closed doors in your shared living space</h3>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s great to learn a new skill, if it&#8217;s at the expense of the people in your shared living space, you need to be a bit more mindful of your practice. If you can&#8217;t sleep, 3 am is not the best time to be practicing your disharmonious tunes.</p>



<p>Even if you play well, your roomis might be sleeping or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/reddit-tips-for-when-you-cant-sleep-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to sleep</a>. So if you have to, keep the volume down. Also, ask your roomis what time of day they&#8217;d prefer you to get some practice in.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. The Grudge</h2>



<p>Finding hair in the drain in shared living spaces is pretty infuriating! Remember the disgusting scene from The Grudge when hair would pop up from the everywhere? If you leave hair in the drain after a shower, your roomis are faced with this scene in real life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pick up your hair!</h3>



<p>So be a good roomi and clean up after a bath when you&#8217;re in a communal living situation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. I love you baby</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s adorable how you and your SO get along. And even more so, when you talk all day about nothing. Also, you make the world a better place with your love. But it is rather annoying when you choose to make everyone listen to it ALL THE TIME.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stop broadcasting your love in a shared living space</h3>



<p>So if you like to talk to your SO all the time, make sure you do it in your room. And not in the shared living spaces in your apartment. Even if your roomis haven&#8217;t recently got their hearts or relationship broken, it&#8217;s annoying to listen to you baby talk to your baby all the time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Hey, you listening?</h2>



<p>As a rule, when your roomis have their earphones on, they don&#8217;t want to be spoken to. They&#8217;re clearly enjoying some time alone and don&#8217;t want to be disturbed. So don&#8217;t talk to them when they have their headphones on!</p>



<p>If what you have to say is not important, wait for them to take their earphones out before you begin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s almost time to ring in the new year! Let’s face it, 2020 has been a tough one. And the pandemic still sits heavily on our shoulders and is still drastically changing many of our lives. While 2020 hasn’t been the best, 2021 is a brand new year and a fresh start for us all. And now the new year is upon us. So it’s the perfect time to start thinking about new year’s resolutions with your roommate.</p>



<p>Whether you and your roomi are the best of friends or you just tolerate one another; here are a few new year’s resolutions for you and your roommates to make your relationship better!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. New year&#8217;s resolution for you and your roommate: Communication!</h2>



<p>One of the most important new years resolutions with your roommate has to be of communication! Communication is absolutely key in any healthy roomi relationship. Your roommate is not a mind reader, even if you think they are! If something is bothering you, make sure to bring it up with your roomi. Talk it out so that the issue doesn’t become bigger.</p>



<p>This is one of the new year&#8217;s resolutions for you and your roommate that helps better understand one another’s personality and living habits. Instead of being passive-aggressive when your roomi forgets to do the dishes, bring up the issue in a non-threatening way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. New year&#8217;s resolution with your roommate: Go over your roommate agreement</h2>



<p>If you haven’t already made one, make resolutions for you and your roommate to create an agreement for 2021! A roommate agreement helps you and your roommate better understand each other’s expectations. Roommate agreements don’t have to be set in stone, they can change as you and your roomi grow as individuals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Areas to cover in your roommate agreement can include </h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>personal boundaries, </li><li>how to handle cleaning,</li><li>how to handle rent and other expenses, </li><li>quiet hours, etc. </li></ul>



<p>Communicate with your roomi to see what they’d like to add to your roommate agreement for the new year!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. New year&#8217;s resolution for you and your roommate: Talk about finances</h2>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-best-money-saving-apps-to-reach-your-finance-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Talking about finances can be a tricky subject, but it doesn’t have to be!</a> Make a new year&#8217;s resolution with your roommate to plan a designated time each month to go over your money expectations and expenses. Make sure that you plan talking to your roomi about finances early on. So that you start 2021 off on the right foot.</p>



<p>First, make sure you have established a monthly budget for you and your roommate. Go over how to handle paying rent as well as other utility bills, such as the electricity and the internet. Next, make sure that you <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.splitwise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agree on an app</a> or a self made system detailing how bills will be paid. Check in with your roomi every month to make sure that all bills are being paid on time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. New year&#8217;s resolution with your roommate: Split up your chores</h2>



<p>Let’s face it, no one enjoys doing the dishes. So one way to help decrease confusion around who’s responsible for doing what chores is to make new year&#8217;s resolutions for you and your roommate to create a monthly chore calendar. Additionally, creating a schedule will help the two of you stick to a routine and keep your apartment clean and tidy. So have fun with making your schedule by choosing a pretty calendar and using colorful markers!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Plan time during the week to bond with your roomi</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you&#8217;re co-living with roommates, there are many situations you might have to adapt to. From learning to bond with the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different personalities of roommates</a> to solving cold wars and tolerating each other day-in, day-out! But the best thing about co-living with roommates, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/taking-coronavirus-precautions-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially at a time like this</a>, is that you get to enjoy festivities with people you spend your days with. And when it&#8217;s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/fun-christmas-tradition-ideas-for-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christmas time</a>, playing Secret Santa might also mean that you run out of gift ideas for your roommates pretty quickly.</p>



<p>But wait, as always, we&#8217;ve got you covered. </p>



<p>So here&#8217;s a list of some of the best Secret Santa gift ideas that you can use this year to make your roommates feel happy and loved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Something they truly need</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l4JzfPzEJAhmFQhu8" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/new-girl-fox-new-girl-l4JzfPzEJAhmFQhu8"></iframe>

	</div>
	


<p>You know your roommates pretty well, right? You know what they like for breakfast, you know about that thing they recently lost or broke, and sometimes you know what&#8217;s really missing from their lives &#8211; because they keep borrowing (or stealing) it from your own room.</p>



<p>So once you know which roomi you&#8217;ll be buying a Secret Santa gift for, start observing what they could use everyday, because nothing makes a better gift than something they can actually use!</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-to-do-roommate-stealing/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">What To Do If My Roommate Steals From Me</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Books, books, and more books!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/26FL2ghZjJQqUoozC" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/new-girl-fox-new-girl-26FL2ghZjJQqUoozC"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>When co-living with a roommate who&#8217;s always buried in books, it&#8217;s easy to choose a cheap Secret Santa gift for them. If you know which authors they like, go ahead and give them a book by their favorite author.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not sure, find out what they&#8217;re currently reading and use Amazon or get recommendations about similar reads. This is also one of the safest gift ideas for your roommates.</p>



<p>Do a little research here, because you don&#8217;t want your Secret Santa gift to be gathering dust on the bookshelf.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A gift bundle of their favorite beverage and snacks</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>You can never have enough of your favorite tea, coffee, or snacks, especially during the cold winter months! So for a roomi you&#8217;re co living with, a gift bundle of the things they love would make the best Secret Santa gift that&#8217;s truly personalized.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not sure which items to pack, a gift card for their favorite store could work too. That way, they can buy whatever they want when the mood strikes.</p>



<p>Sneak in a cute note to make it the best Secret Santa ever!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gift ideas that will be good for your roommate, and for you!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:48%">

	</div>
	


<p>You know when you&#8217;re co-living with roommates and some of their habits start to annoy you so much that you think you can&#8217;t live with them anymore? Say, for example, they listen to really loud music all the time, and when you tell them to wear headphones, they claim not to have any good ones. Or maybe they&#8217;re super messy and it&#8217;s been getting on your nerves all year.</p>



<p>In these situations, the best Secret Santa gift is something that helps you both! Get creative and gift them something they use as an excuse for being annoying, or even a quirky gift that celebrates their flaw and gives both of you a laugh out of it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Something to keep up with the cold.</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>Socks, sweaters, scarves, mufflers and other warm clothing will make your roomi smile! So if you don&#8217;t know what they would like and are searching for an easy, affordable gift, something warm and cozy will always go down well.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">DIY gifts are always a heartfelt option.</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re coliving with a roommate you truly love, there&#8217;s nothing better than a handmade gift that represents the unique bond you have.</p>



<p>A fun DIY project, a sweet painting of something they love, or even a delicious hand-cooked meal, their favorite type of bread or heartwarming cake &#8211; anything you make with love will be truly appreciated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Although living with a roommate is awesome for the most part, shared living can be challenging sometimes. Initially, moving out of your parent&#8217;s home seems wonderful. Additionally, you romanticize being best buds with your new roomies, getting home at whatever time you like without having to sneak in, and having sleepovers with friends every weekend! The dream. Sure, it&#8217;s fun, but sooner rather than later&#8230; you start to notice your differences, and some annoying roommate habits. And you start wondering if living with roommates could get easier. But don&#8217;t worry. Here&#8217;s your roommate guide to all things annoying! Read on. </p>



<p>You and your roommates are different people (even if you get along with your roomi well otherwise!), and sometimes you find yourself noticing the annoying roommate habits. Most of all, you’re struggling not getting your own way around the house… we’ve all been there.</p>



<p>Naturally, your roomi shares your feelings. </p>



<p>While living with roommates is not always the best thing, and they might not be your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/making-perfectish-roommates-a-reality-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">soul-roommate</a>, learning how to navigate the great indoors with your current roommate will make both of your lives easier and more enjoyable!</p>



<p>Here’s the roommate guide to how exactly you can do that. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Accept the annoying roommate habits</h2>



<p>When it comes to doing things around the home, you like things to be a certain way. From keeping the kitchen sink empty at all times and rinsing the dishes right after eating, to keeping the cushions on the couch a certain way. And you and your roomi might not see eye to eye on these little things. Just remember, that’s okay! It can be turned from annoying roommate habits to just something that is a fact of life.</p>



<p>Ultimately, everyone’s different. So, our number one rule for happiness when it comes to shared living with roommates is to accept your differences and annoying roommate habits too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Talk about it</h2>



<p>Once you accept your differences when co-living, it&#8217;s key to remember that communication can go a long way.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re worried that their habit of leaving the sink overflowing with dirty dishes could bring mice in, let them know. It makes sense to talk to each other about annoying roommate habits instead of ignoring the elephant in the room.</p>



<p>Our roommate guide says, keeping things inside will make co-living tougher for you. If you&#8217;re having trouble confronting your roommate, you could always send a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/texts-resolve-common-roommate-conflicts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">text to resolve your conflicts.</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Compromise is key when it comes to annoying roommate habits</h2>



<p>If you find yourself singing &#8220;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/10-ways-to-let-go-of-the-need-to-control_b_7305102" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">I want it that way</a>&#8221; a little too often, ask yourself what&#8217;s really bothering you. Is it just that you didn&#8217;t get your own way, or is it something else?</p>



<p>If hygiene isn&#8217;t compromised and it&#8217;s simply a difference in opinions, try doing things their way once in a while. Who knows, you might find a new way to keep order in the house and like it too!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Collaborate on the house rules</h2>



<p>No one likes a know it all &#8211; one of the most annoying roommate habits there is. And let&#8217;s face it &#8211; when someone tells you not to do something, you itch to do it even more! So, if you&#8217;re someone who wants things a certain way and wants to make rules about it, ask for your roomis input instead of just stating your rules.</p>



<p>If your roomi is a night owl and watches TV too loudly at night, but like Cinderella, you want to be off to dreamland by midnight, this is a clash of lifestyles that needs to be addressed. Just remember, this can be resolved without you going to sleep annoyed every night. Sit together and try to find the middle ground for a happy co-living experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. It works both ways</h2>



<p>You cannot expect your roomi to cooperate if you&#8217;re not willing to do the same. So instead of constantly wishing they&#8217;d be more co-operative, see where you can meet in the middle to cooperate and set an example for healthy shared living. In the long run, you&#8217;ll find that they&#8217;re more willing to do the same for you! And slowly, the annoying roommate habits will stop bothering you.  </p>
