<p>So it looks like traditional Halloween activities are pretty much canceled this year. So how do we spend Halloween month now? Just like we&#8217;re spending all our days since the pandemic hit: by watching movies! But we&#8217;re not watching any random movies, we&#8217;re talking about the best horror movies! Because there&#8217;s a lot of great scary movies on Netflix right now, it would be shame to not take advantage of it. How else will you welcome Halloween season?!</p>



<p>So, when trick or treating seems risky and out of bounds, here are some of the best horror movies to welcome Halloween! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. One of the best horror movies: Halloween &#8211; John Carpenter, 1978</h2>



<p>The list wouldn&#8217;t be justified if it didn&#8217;t include the Halloween film series, would it? Why? Because it&#8217;s one of the best horror movies out there! You cannot welcome Halloween season without this one!</p>



<p>But make sure you shut all your windows and doors before you sit to watch the classic horror movie series because 21-year-old Michael Myers is looking for his next victim!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. One of the disturbing horror movies: Hereditary &#8211; Ari Aster, 2018</h2>



<p>This is one of the newer Halloween movies out there. But Ari Aster displays his forte in the genre of &#8216;disturbing&#8217; with Hereditary! Watch it at your own risk because you&#8217;ll be getting nightmares for days after you&#8217;ve seen it.</p>
