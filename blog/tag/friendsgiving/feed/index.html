<p>Any other year, most students would be spending their Thanksgiving break with their families. But this is 2020. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">With Covid-19 in full swing</a>, naturally many will decide to stay put and celebrate thanksgiving without the fam&#8230; but just because you can’t be with your folks doesn’t mean you can’t still have a fantastic Thanksgiving with your roommates!</p>



<p>Known as &#8216;Friendsgiving&#8217; this is no traditional holiday!</p>



<p>Here are a few ways in which you can make the most of Friendsgiving, and make memories that will last a lifetime!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Apartment decor to celebrate Thanksgiving with your roommates</h2>



<p>One of the easiest ways to feel more festive is to spruce up your apartment with festive decor! Scented candles, a wreath, and fall vegetables such as Pumpkins are all great ways to make your apartment look more thanksgiving ready. A super simple (and affordable!) way of making your dining table look fancy is to use the seasonal veggies as centrepieces too. You can even find the candles and a tablecloth from your local thrift store or Goodwill!</p>



<p>Trust us, going out to buy a few budget-friendly things for thanksgiving with your roommates will make the day feel special and get you into the festive mood. Whether you go all out with decor or choose to DIY, there&#8217;s no holiday season without fun and festive decorations! So, use your Thanksgiving break wisely!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dinner Menu to celebrate Thanksgiving with your roommates</h2>



<p>Everyone knows that food is the most important part of any holiday. So, this is the one area where you cannot fall behind! But let’s face it, most college students don’t have the equipment, skill, time or money to make an elaborate Thanksgiving meal. So, get together with your roommates and decide on a simple menu for Thanksgiving. If you don’t feel like doing much cooking at all, it’s completely fine to order some Chinese food or get meals from the supermarket &#8211; treat yourself however you&#8217;d like!</p>



<p>The benefit of celebrating with your roomis is that you don’t have to make things you don’t like eating. Don’t like mashed potatoes? Switch it up with roast potatoes instead. Don’t like turkey? Get chicken roast instead. Don’t like pumpkin pie? Make whatever dessert you want! The point is that you get to decide what you want to eat, so make the most of it! You could also invite your friends (if it&#8217;s safe) and turn dinner into a pot-luck meal.</p>



<p>And don’t forget, it doesn’t have to be perfect. You don’t need to have fancy cutlery sets or matching table mats! The charm of Friendsgiving is that it&#8217;s chill and laid back, so enjoy it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Table Settings</strong></h2>



<p>When planning your table setting for thanksgiving with your roommates, it’s best to keep things minimal and basic. It’s completely fine to use disposable plates, napkins, cups and cutlery- it’s way easier to clean up and adds to the charm of a college Friendsgiving. If you don’t have a dining space or if it’s too small, you could even make a little picnic spot on the floor where everyone can sit and eat. After all, pillows and blankets and your favourite PJ&#8217;s make for a very cozy atmosphere! A formal dinner might feel out-of-place if you’re celebrating with your friends, so ditch the (proverbial) high heels and get comfy!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Entertainment</strong></h2>



<p>No party is complete without entertainment. So, think of some party games that you can play before and after dinner. Whether you play cards, drinking games or good old monopoly, the choices are endless! But be sure to create a playlist for the party so that you can have awesome music playing throughout the night and keep spirits high! Take this time to bond with your roomis, you probably won’t get to spend time with them like this again. That&#8217;s what celebrating thanksgiving with your roommates is all about!</p>



<p>At the end of the day, you need to throw caution to the wind and do what feels good to you and your roomis. Who knows, maybe this Thanksgiving break will be the beginning of a new tradition!</p>
