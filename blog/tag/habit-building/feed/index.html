<p>Saving for a vacation, a laptop, to pay off your student loans? Whatever you may be saving money for, setting up visual reminders in places you look the most will help you stay focused and save more.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re planning a vacation to see the northern lights, put up a photo/visual reminder of it in your bedroom, workstation, and even your bathroom. All these photos will remind you of your purpose.</p>



<p>Basically, if you love online shopping and can&#8217;t help it &#8211; try changing your phone and desktop background to a photo/creative that represents a fat zero or an empty wallet. This little activity will take the excitement out of your usual online haul.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Saving money the elite way: follow the 48-hour rule</h2>



<p>So you saw this really cool thing online, and you can&#8217;t wait to move the item from your virtual cart to your home. Give the item 48 hours before you buy it. You will only buy something that you really need, which makes your day-to-day tasks more manageable. Impulse buys = temporary happiness. Studies show that the joy of impulse buy is momentary, and an individual feels more stressed to have not saved that money. One of the best ways to cut expenses and save money is to give any buy 48 hours of consideration &#8211; if you really need it, you will be back to purchase it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our best money saving tip: Use cash instead of cards</h2>

<p>This trick is relatively simple but highly effective. If you have a specific weekly spending amount, encash it and use it for all your week&#8217;s purchases. This way, you will be able to track your expenditure and keep tabs on how much is left. Moreover, cards have a way of making us feel less guilty about our purchases and expenses. With cash, the parting pain is much greater compared to plastic tapping and swiping.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Explore cheaper plans</h2>



<p>Our phone and television plans can sum up to be quite hefty. Revaluate your needs based on your consumption. Choose the subscriptions that fit your lifestyle. You can alternatively <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/keep-track-expenses-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">decide to split television or online app plans with your roomis</a> to make it more sustainable. Remember, there are always cheaper plans and subscriptions available in the market which can help you save a lot of money.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bargain!! </h2>

<p>This is by far, the easiest of all the money saving tips that exist. Thrift shopping is like treasure hunting; one won&#8217;t know what they might find. These places say that they have fixed prices, but you can always talk sweetly in conversation. And with bulk buying, and you could bargain for a better price. There&#8217;s no harm in trying &#8211; imagine getting a great deal on that almost new television set or a gorgeous furniture piece.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Put your savings in the bank</h2>



<p>If you can&#8217;t control your spendings &#8211; give it to someone more responsible like the bank. Your bank can help you maintain a savings account, which you will find easier to manage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Watch and reward yourself as you keep learning new money saving tips!</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s so easy to point at the clouds and say &#8220;This is where I want to be&#8221;. The real challenge is to get your hands dirty to do what you need to do every day until you ultimately reach your goal. But that&#8217;s what adulting is all about. Did you make any new year&#8217;s resolutions this year to make life easy? Did you know that many people give up on the resolutions they make during the first week, if not sooner! Habit building can be really hard but with some effort, it will totally transform your life!</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re trying to make some positive changes, doing it regularly and often really makes sense. Taking at least <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access/effects-of-walking-exercises-on-body-composition-heart-rate-variability-and-perceptual-responses-in-overweight-and-obese-adolescen-2155-9880-1000559.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10,000 steps a day</a>, meditating for 10 minutes a day, volunteering once a week, or automating your savings are great examples of positive habits. Let&#8217;s take a look at 10 such habits that will make adulting easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Make life easy and be organized </h2>



<p>Organization takes time, and you might not feel organized a hundred percent of the time. But adulting is all about trying and trying again. Simple things like arriving to places on time (no one likes tardiness), being prepared, and knowing where your things are will bring you a step closer to feeling like you are organized. It&#8217;s also a great habit to make a &#8216;to-do list&#8217; before going to bed to prepare for the next day. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Practice the best adulting hack- relaxing! </h2>



<p>Take a moment to release the pent-up stress &#8211; pause from time-to-time. This will help you restore your mind and you&#8217;ll return to your tasks feeling organized. One of the first steps to a relaxed state of mind is to concentrate on your breathing for three to five minutes. This is the best part of adulting, so enjoy it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Take action and it will make life easy.</h2>



<p>All plans are mere potentials without action. The habit of acting quickly and often is an art. Successful people start early; maybe even before they are ready, which may sound counterintuitive. While people around you are looking for excuses to not dive in, taking action is what sets you apart. According to James Clear, to take action before one feels ready is perhaps right. But one has to begin and take the first step quickly. Things follow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Habit building exercise 1: Self-care</h2>



<p>You&#8217;re sitting in the office, working long hours. Going over that presentation or social media campaign that you&#8217;re planning with your team. There&#8217;s so much to be done, so what do you do? How do you fit all of this in? You overwork. Cut down your meditation session, skip your workout. Order-in, instead of cooking a healthy meal. This might seem like something you have to do, but remember that it can cause problems in the long run.</p>



<p>Everybody needs time to unwind. It&#8217;s not the length of time that matters as much as quality time. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061015/how-elon-musk-became-elon-musk.asp" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk,</a> the CEO of Tesla Motors, was asked what daily practice has had the most substantial positive impact on his life. His succinct answer was simply: &#8220;Showering.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Want to make life easy? Be positive!</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><a href="https://addicted2success.com/quotes/29-positive-quotes-for-changing-your-life/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wade Boggs</a> says, &#8220;A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events, and outcomes. It is a catalyst, and it sparks extraordinary results.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Positive self-talk and gratitude play an essential part in elevating your attitude. While It&#8217;s so easy to fall into a slump based off one negative experience, it can be just as easy to redirect your mind and, instead, focus on the &#8211; hopefully more &#8211; positive experiences.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Manage your money; don&#8217;t let it manage you</h2>



<p>There can be a lot of stress when it comes to money. But is it the cash&#8217;s fault or rather our relation with it that needs work? This is where some positive habit building will change your life. Respect your money, and it&#8217;ll respect you back. Take the time to learn about how you can manage your money better. Make an expense sheet, save a portion of your salary, invest in something. Remember, YOU have the power to multiply your money.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Rising early</h2>



<p>The attitude we have in the morning usually ends up defining our day. After a certain point in life, one needs to establish a few difficult habits. Rising early is definitely easier said than done. But no one said habit building was easy. We&#8217;re all guilty of hitting that snooze button to get a few extra minutes of sleep. But you know what? The first promise we actually make to ourselves is what time we&#8217;re going to get up. Get in the habit of practicing making a promise to yourself and keeping it. This is about more than just &#8220;waking up.&#8221; This is about the habit.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Sharing</h2>



<p>The habit of giving isn&#8217;t one that people think of when they want to make life easy. After all, giving requires effort, and isn&#8217;t that the opposite of easy? But remember, success is a goal that results in more than just a personal accumulation of wealth. The habit of giving also brings in the added sense of joy that runs deeper to fuel your habits to more success. However, lack of wealth should not deter anyone as a factor when it comes to sharing. Volunteering in your community or time with children in a class does not cost anything. But the value it brings into your life is immeasurable. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Reading</h2>



<p>Somewhere after, &#8220;lose weight&#8221;, &#8220;stop procrastinating,&#8221; and &#8220;find love,&#8221; &#8220;read more&#8221; is one of the top goals people set for themselves and for a good reason. Reading can be incredibly satisfying, but if you haven&#8217;t had the chance to explore reading, simply make it an experience! Sit with a nice cup of tea or coffee in a cozy space during sunrise, sunset, or at the beach. Believe us, doing this will make you feel like you&#8217;ve mastered adulting!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Eat healthy</h2>



<p>Did you know that millennials have been nicknamed the &#8220;<a href="https://news.sanfordhealth.org/sanford-health-plan/millennials-wellness-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wellness generation</a>&#8220;? Millennials are changing their <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/easy-healthy-budget-meals/1252/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eating habits</a>, and the marketplace is keeping up with it. In the last decade, we&#8217;ve seen a rise in fresh, organic produce, and the preservative-rich canned food demand is decreasing. This proves that with some positive habit building, we can also bring change on a large scale! Not to mention, eating healthy with our demanding schedules is imperative. Eat healthily, think better, live longer.</p>
