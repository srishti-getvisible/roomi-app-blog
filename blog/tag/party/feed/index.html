<p>First of all, let us clarify that that’s not a <em>typo</em>! Galentine’s Day does exist. If you’ve ever watched <em>Parks and Recreation</em>, you know what Galentine’s Day is. For the uninformed, it’s a holiday celebrated on February 13th where we cherish our friends and the deep bonds we share. The day was created and popularized by Amy Poehler&#8217;s character Leslie Knope from the same sitcom. She described the day as &#8220;ladies celebrating ladies,&#8221; and we said YES! However, the day has evolved and become more inclusive over the years.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="galentine-s-day-theme">Galentine’s Day Theme</h2>



<p>You can choose any theme for the party, from a sleepover to a pizza party or a wine and chocolate night. If you’re overwhelmed by too many Galentine’s Day party ideas, create a fun poll among your friends to help you decide! Additionally, here are a few things that you might want to do for the big day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="suggest-a-dress-code">Suggest a Dress Code</h3>



<p>Think of a dress code for the party and hit up your group chat for some cool ‘fit suggestions. You can take the traditional route and choose to match colors (like red since it’s close to Valentine’s Day), or you can rock matching pajamas. Whatever you choose, just ensure everyone feels comfortable and ready for the camera click.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="bake-off">Bake Off</h3>



<p>Face off? <em>Nah</em>, we suggest a bake-off! Organize a friendly competition among your best pals to see who’s got the skills to bake the best looking and best-tasting dish ever! Select a recipe and let everyone try their hands baking it. The best part is everyone wins here, because unlike other competitions, everyone gets to try all these tasty treats!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="galentine-s-day-party-games">Galentine’s Day Party Games</h3>



<p>White Elephant is a popular holiday game you can makeover as a Galentine’s Day party game. Although there are many versions of it, here is the basic concept:</p>



<p>Everyone has to bring a gift. Each player will be assigned a random number, and then each turn, one person chooses to either unwrap a new gift or steal someone else’s. For example, the person who goes first gets to open any gift of their choice. Each person then continues in numerical order. If your gift gets stolen, you get to go again! The game ends once everyone has received a gift.</p>



<p>Note: It’s always good to have a dollar limit so everyone receives a gift of the same value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="galentine-s-day-decorating-ideas">Galentine’s Day Decorating Ideas</h2>



<p>Choose a color palette for your party and start shopping for decorations if you haven&#8217;t already! Pink, red, gold, and white are some of the most <a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/308355905745897435/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular colors for a Galentine’s party</a>. Since it&#8217;s a day to shower your platonic love for your pals, you can <a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/1125968647568117/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">deck up the party venue with balloons, streamers, and banners</a>. Additionally, if you plan to sit down for a meal, you also need to <a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/844493665964684/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">set up the dinner table</a>. A colorful tablecloth, some scented candles in fashionable holders, and fresh flowers of the season will do the trick.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="galentine-s-day-party-food">Galentine’s Day Party Food</h2>



<p>Did we hear food? Of course! No party can be complete without a delicious spread, a few bottles of vino, some hearty chats, and endless laughter. But if you’re a true fan of <em>Parks and Recreation</em>, you must be familiar with Leslie Knope’s obsession with breakfast food! So, why not set up your Galentine’s party table with a brunch menu in her honor? Serve heart-shaped waffles, bacon, eggs, bagels, muffins, scones, croissants, and coffee to your pals.</p>



<p>And here’s a pro tip to take your party to the next level: arrange your breakfast spread on a charcuterie board. Voila! You just created an art piece that will surely grab eyeballs on the ‘Gram.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="galentine-s-day-party-activities">Galentine&#8217;s Day Party Activities</h2>



<p>When you have your pals around, you can do anything! <em>Well, almost.</em> But if you want to keep your besties entertained and jazz up the spirit, we have rounded up a list of Galentine’s Day Party ideas for activities!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="marathon-movie-night">Marathon Movie Night</h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="nail-art">Nail Art</h3>



<p>Get a good <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spectacular-Nail-Art-Step-Step/dp/1623540259/ref=sr_1_2?crid=GOBM6W2BLDXS&amp;keywords=manicure+set&amp;qid=1642775674&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=manicuset%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C348&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">nail art se</a>t at home, and spend the evening with your buds creating some fancy nail art.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="selfie-booth">Selfie Booth</h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="game-night">Game Night</h3>

Once all the participants are ready, hand out the first clue and let them race around to find the remaining clues until one person finds the final surprise! You may also play Galentine’s Day-themed guessing games. For example, you can say some facts (a few correct and a few incorrect) about one of the guests, and let the others guess which of the facts is correct. Or, guests can take turns answering questions about each other or about their friendships with the hosts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sing-along">Sing-Along</h3>



<p>Not in the mood to dance?

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="personalized-goodie-bags">Personalized Goodie Bags</h3>



<p>Conclude your party with a sweet gesture by sending your guests home with personalized goodie bags and handwritten thank you notes. While the goodies will remind them of the fun they had at the party, the customized card will be a memento of the time you spent together.</p>
