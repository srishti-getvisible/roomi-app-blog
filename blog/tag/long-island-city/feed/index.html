<p>It&#8217;s a Saturday and you and your roommates are bored out of your wits. There&#8217;s nothing that excites any of you on Netflix, and the day just <em>calls</em> for some outdoors.</p>



<p>Guess what? Only a short ride subway away from the most New York City neighborhoods, Long Island City has enough and more in store for all your exploratory needs. So head out for a hearty brunch and a stroll, or explore hidden gems to your must-experience list for 2021!</p>



<p>Historically called Dutch Kills, Long Island City is experiencing quite the <a href="https://untappedcities.com/2013/08/01/hunters-point-long-island-city-the-modern-corridor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dramatic renewal process</a> — which includes rezoning as well. Moreover, Long Island City is known for its centralized location and its manufacturing and industrial influences. Alot of it&#8217;s glory comes from it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_transportation_in_New_York_City" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">served as an integral point between Queen&#8217;s road networks in the 19th century. This was meant for the construction of the Queensboro Bridge connecting Manhattan</a>.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s everything you and your roommates needs to satiate your explorers&#8217; curiosity and add to your list of must-do things in Long Island City!</p>

<p>Casa Enrique is known to keep things super simple with their Mexican cuisine. Especially if you&#8217;re looking to avoid any frills or extras that&#8217;ll take your attention away from the beauty of traditional home-cooked meals, straight from Chiapas, Mexico.</p>



<p>Chef Cosme Aquilar&#8217;s menu consists of classics like guacamole, ceviche, and a variety of enchiladas and tacos. But it&#8217;s the fresh and seasonal ingredients that really pack a punch. Some even argue this is the best Mexican food you&#8217;re going to find in Long Island. If that doesn&#8217;t make your list of &#8216;must-do things with your roommates,&#8217; what does?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s just call MoMA PS1 the hip young sister of the world-renowned MoMA in midtown Manhattan, which identifies as more of an &#8220;exhibition space,&#8221; as opposed to an &#8220;institution of collections.&#8221;</p>



<p>MoMA PS1 showcases experimental and contemporary art, usually utilizing interactive elements like sound, video, light, and more. VW Sunday Sessions allow visitors to experience and participate in live art. Also, throughout the summer its popular Warm Up Series hosts live electronic music concerts, taking place within some type of artistic installation.</p>

<p>Inspired by the three-wheeled motor rickshaws found across Thailand along with many other Southeast Asian countries, Tuk Tuk is the perfect spot for Thai food in Long Island.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll find classics like Pad Thai and Tom Yum Soup. The more traditional Thai street food dishes like Mee-Kiew-Hang and Kaw-Moo-Dang will surprise you! Above all, you find yourself and roommates craving on a Saturday spent out!</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll find a few Tamashii Ramen locations in Queens. And you shouldn&#8217;t miss out on this one if you&#8217;re in Long Island. Additionally, The expansive menu that Tamashii boasts of, consists of some rich broths made fresh daily. Including chicken, five different vegetables, simmered for a whole 14 hours!</p>



<p>A whole colony of seafood and medicinal herbs are added to balance the flavor. And they offer nutritional elements!  Above all, their popular bowls include the Miso Ramen (soybean-flavored ramen)! Along with, the Shio Ramen (made with mineral salt), and Shoyu Ramen (made with soy sauce). In conclusion if you&#8217;re the kind that doesn&#8217;t shy away from spice, try the Tan-Tan Men! It&#8217;s esssentially a hot sesame flavored ramen.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">Long Island City neighborhood in Queens is an industrial center no longer. It has evolved into an affordable place to enjoy a thriving arts scene and a waterfront park with some of the best views of Manhattan you’re going to get this side of a helicopter. Despite being crazy close to Manhattan, a mere 20 minutes, Long Island City feels a lot quieter than you might expect. Perfect for anyone looking to play hard in the city and sleep hard at home.</span> Here&#8217;s Roomi&#8217;s Long Island City neighborhood review. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enjoy the <b>thriving arts scene</b></strong></h2>



<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">Long Island City neighborhood in Queens is very active in the fine arts.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MoMa PS1 is, in fact, one of the largest and oldest non-profit contemporary arts centers not just in NYC, but in the entire country. If the idea of being one of the first to discover an emerging artist whose work stimulates discussion, ignites ideas and drives change, then you should be a regular visitor to MoMa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sunday sessions live performances let you experience firsthand real time performances from new and established artists. You can enjoy their latest musical performances, dances, speeches and more. And while MoMa encourages donations, the PS1 center is</span><a href="https://www.moma.org/visit/index" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">free for NYC residents</span></a> while you&#8217;re in the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Get the <b>best views of Manhattan</b> when you&#8217;re in the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens </strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want some of the absolute best views of the Manhattan skyline, day or night, then head on over to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gantry State Park from the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens. It’s a five minute ride from Manhattan. So getting to the park, or heading to the lively and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/living-in-nyc-affordable-neighborhoods-in-manhattan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exciting Manhattan</a> scene afterwards, are pretty easy. Gantry State Park is right on the waterfront. The views of the Manhattan skyline are totally unobstructed. The East River here is very peaceful, making it prime selfie-shot territory to send jealously-inducing pics to your friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have regular events and activities, including exercise classes and a 5K race if running and fitness is your thing. For something a little more cerebral, they have chess and checker matches along the waterfront for you to enjoy. The list of activities goes on and on, from Easter egg hunts to fishing to weddings.</span> So we give an absolute thumbs up for our Long Island City neighborhood review!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>There are plenty of <b>sweet choices for dating and socializing</b></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gantry State Park and the surrounding area are full of options for places to eat as well, in case you want to bring your date to a nice spot by the river. The</span><a href="http://riverviewny.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Riverview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is very classy but also quite friendly. Their bottomless brunch option is perfect if you’re active in the dating scene. For a more informal place to eat in a group with friends, head on over to the</span><a href="http://cornerbistrony.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Corner Bistro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has the kind of energetic vibe that is perfect for winding up your Friday night.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Long Island City neighborhood in Queens has an average monthly rent of $1,018 on Roomiapp.com. It offers affordable living incredibly close to Manhattan. This is the place to be if you want to enjoy the exciting social scene New York City is world famous for, but have a home base to return to where you can actually sleep.</span></p>
