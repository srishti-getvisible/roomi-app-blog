<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests knowing what you exactly want in terms of accommodation when living on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re going to spend the most on rent and it&#8217;s not going to be frugal. You just have to be honest with yourself about what you want and you&#8217;re going to have to pay for it. The more roommates you have, the less you&#8217;ll pay. So remember that when you chart your living expenses budget in New York.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hyperside89 says you need to accept that rent is going to be your highest expense</h3>



<p>Rent is going to be your highest expense. Accept it, don&#8217;t fret over it. Some people will tell you to live in a place you don&#8217;t feel safe, or to cram 5 people in a two bedroom apartment to save money (slight exaggeration). Don&#8217;t do it. If your home is a place you want to be you&#8217;ll spend more time there, aka not being out spending money. I just spend the entire Sunday in my apartment cooking, reading, etc. Didn&#8217;t spend a dime. My rent is $1,100 a month (+ $40-60 on utilities) and so worth it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests moving to Manhattan for living on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>Move to Manhattan My BF and I live in the UWS and are moving next month. We have signed papers for a place in Harlem &#8211; it is up and coming and super convenient train-wise. Safe and very neighborhood-y. We will only be spending $1500 for a 1BR which is SUPER CHEAP. We will be able to afford to buy a used car soon and parking is also affordable up there. I love the neighborhood and it is totally worth looking into for living on a budget in New York.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage speaks the truth about commuting on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re going to spend the same amount on the subway as everyone else and there&#8217;s also nothing you can do about it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user Artichokeowl suggests knowing for sure how often you&#8217;d <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hacks-to-the-subway-in-nyc-we-all-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the subway</a></h3>



<p>One thing that helps is thinking about how often you will really need to take the subway or bus. If you know for SURE that you&#8217;ll need to take it to and from work/school every single day, go for the monthly pass. If you think you&#8217;ll take it less often, decide how you want to do it by figuring out how much you pay per trip given how often you take the subway with the different metrocard options. This is the best way to live on a budget in New York.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests Brooklyn for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/frugal-living-how-to-get-groceries-on-a-budget-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">grocery shopping</a></h3>



<p>If you go to deep Brooklyn for your groceries you&#8217;ll save soooooo much money. It&#8217;s awesome how cheap it is.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests Trader Joe&#8217;s</h3>



<p>Really worth the wait because every other place seems overpriced when living on a budget in New York. Just buy a granny cart and play sudoku on your phone. For the two of us, I only spend ~$120/month there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hyperside89 says cooking will save you tons of money</h3>



<p>Cook to live on a budget in New York. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/10-life-lessons-learned-from-cooking-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cooking</a> will save you SO MUCH MONEY. Don&#8217;t even worry about seeking out the cheapest groceries in the city. I shop at my local grocery store which has average prices and I only pay $180 a month in groceries. Don&#8217;t go crazy on caviar, etc and don&#8217;t go to Whole Foods for everything and you&#8217;ll be fine. For context, I do eat a primarily vegetarian / vegan diet heavy on veggies but not exclusively.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz also suggests cooking instead of eating out or ordering in</h3>



<p>Honestly, the food sucks for the price anyway. If my $50 meal was $20, I would buy it. But it&#8217;s actually $50 and very overpriced. I spend my money on nice food I cook at home. We eat out at quality restaurants once or twice a month. That way we sample a bunch of places and really look forward to it when living on a budget in New York.</p>



<p>On the same note, no take out.&nbsp;Resist. Save for snowy days when you are sick and there is a HIMYM marathon on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fitting everything else in your budget in New York</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests their choice of money saving apps and other financial management tips</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There are AMAZING <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-best-money-saving-apps-to-reach-your-finance-goals/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">apps for saving money</a> on various nyc happenings and restaurants. ScoutMob and Savored are my favorites for living on a budget in New York.</li>



<li>Drink before you go out if you want to save money on going out. Don&#8217;t go to places with cover charges.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s not easy to live on a budget in New York. But if you want to live here, you&#8217;ll make it work. Who needs a retirement fund anyway?</li>



<li>Edit: also Amazon Prime for all your shopping</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests investing in memberships</h3>



<p>I roller skate, enjoy French films and picnics during the summer. Thus, I purchase loyalty/membership cards to the rink and film festivals. I enjoy these things and buy them at rates so I can do them often, on the cheap. It is important to do things you enjoy and spend your money right when you&#8217;re living on a budget in New York.</p>

<p>Honest you CAN live within your budget in New York. My suggestion is to really really save as much as possible. Put away as much as you can. A job is really important to have once you get here because if you don&#8217;t you will eat into your savings damn fast. Happened to me. Had a place but couldn&#8217;t get a job for around 2-3 months. Really hard on my savings.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s super possible! It can just be hard.</p>



<p>Quick breakdown of my expenses per month:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rent: $560</li>



<li>Utilities: $75-$100</li>



<li>Phone: $100</li>



<li>Metro: $120</li>



<li>Food: $150-$200</li>
</ul>



<p>Some months are better than others. Sometimes I get lucky and make my payments on time, other times no. So don&#8217;t be afraid or ashamed to ask for help if you need it.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. There&#8217;s more to shelved items that meet the eye</h3>



<p>Avoid picking shelved items linear to your eye level as they tend to be the most expensive variant. Which also means no grocery shopping in a rush. Take your time and explore other brands of the product you have on your grocery list.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Bring Your Own Bag</h3>



<p>Think 360 degrees when you&#8217;re getting groceries on a budget in NYC. A shopping bag from the grocery store can cost anywhere between 50 cents to a dollar.</p>



<p>Also, you might need a couple of them depending on how long your grocery list is. You can easily save $10-$12 per month.</p>



<p>What more can I say, it&#8217;s budgeting baeby!</p>

<p>We know, we know, &#8220;organize your closet!&#8221; sounds like something your mom used to say to you as a kid and it probably annoyed you back then. But as you grow older, something changes. Just the sight of a well-put-together closet (that you’ve spent hours cleaning out), you desperately want to expand your space, and DIY hacks give you life.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Organize your Closet- Step 1: &#8220;<strong>Keep or Toss&#8221;</strong></h2>



<p>In order to expand your space and organize your closet, there are a few things to keep in mind which will make the whole organizing process a lot easier for you. To begin, you will have to play a little game of Keep or Toss. And this step will cause no burden on your budget, so there&#8217;s that.</p>



<p>If you’re a hoarder, this step will be really difficult for you; letting go of things, and the memories attached to them, can be really hard. But believe me, if you want to expand your space, this step is a must. <a href="https://projecthotmess.com/things-from-your-wardrobe-you-need-to-throw-out-today/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here is a really helpful guide</a> to make this process easier! One way to do this is by dividing your clothes up into different sections- your day-to-day clothes, your office clothes, your party clothes, and so on. Once they&#8217;re in different sections, the process of throwing clothes away (or donating them) will feel less overwhelming. Now that you have narrowed down your stuff, you can start to organize your closet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: a<strong>nalyze your space</strong></h2>



<p>Just like every person is unique, their storage space is unique as well. In this case, one shoe does not fit all (or however that saying goes). So once your space is completely empty, take a good hard look at it. How would you organize your closet? If you don’t have a hanging rod, now would be a very good time to invest in one. Do you think adding some shelves would make life easier? Or maybe the whole thing could use a cool new paint job. Whatever it is that you think would spruce up the space, you should look into it. This is a <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/organizing/g2171/diy-closet-organizers/?slide=3" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">great place to look at DIY hacks</a>.</p>



<p>Adding some cute lights and paint can really brighten up your room without much effort at all. Here is where you can figure out what kind of storage solution you need &#8211; whether it’s baskets, a chest of drawers, hooks, or hangers. So, go ahead and figure out what the space needs, but keep your budget in mind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: <strong>DIY hacks</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, all the arts-and-crafts geeks, this is your time to shine. To organize your closet on a budget means you need to use a lot of DIY hacks. This is a great time to reuse old boxes as storage solutions. Old shoeboxes, cartons, boxes you got from Amazon deliveries, just need a bit of makeover, and just like that, you’ve got yourself a fancy storage box. You can use cute wrapping paper to match them to your decor theme. Just be sure to label the boxes at the end, so you know which box contains what.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 4: expand your <strong>hanging space</strong></h2>



<p>Most of us are so preoccupied with making space in our shelves and drawers, that we forget that there is a perfect space that is being completely ignored &#8211; the space <em>above</em> your shelves. Expand your space by hanging your clothes. It also makes finding your clothes a million times easier.</p>



<p>You don’t have to keep digging around to find that one dress you bought last summer &#8211; it&#8217;s right in front of you! If you don’t already have one, get a hanging rod installed ASAP. And while you’re at it, buy a few hooks for the back of your door as well. It is a fantastic place to hang your scarves, belts, headbands, or hats. This is one of the greatest DIY hacks of all time!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 5: <strong>Expand your space</strong></h2>



<p>Haven’t you ever looked at your closet after a shopping spree and thought to yourself, “damn, I wish I had a little bit more space for my stuff.” Well, maybe that’s something that <em>is</em> possible. You can actually expand your space in your closet by raising your existing shelves or hanging rod by a few inches. This is a really simple yet effective way to open up your space and organize your closet. DIY hacks ftw!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Step 6: d<strong>on’t forget about the floor!</strong></h2>



<p>If you want to expand your space, don&#8217;t forget about the floors! Utilizing your floor space will really give you a lot of additional room to store your stuff. Of course, we’re not asking you to put your clothes on the floor and forget about it. Here is where storage drawers will really save you. These are relatively cheap and are available at most hardware stores. <a href="https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/organize-closets-with-11-things-you-already-own-49437" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">There are also some great DIY hacks</a> available if you want to get crafty! If you feel like splurging a little, get wicker baskets for your floor &#8211; they’re great for storing stuff and they look GORGEOUS.</p>



<p>Now that you have the tools to organize your closet, go forth and make us all proud!</p>

<p>Saving for a vacation, a laptop, to pay off your student loans? Whatever you may be saving money for, setting up visual reminders in places you look the most will help you stay focused and save more.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re planning a vacation to see the northern lights, put up a photo/visual reminder of it in your bedroom, workstation, and even your bathroom. All these photos will remind you of your purpose.</p>



<p>Basically, if you love online shopping and can&#8217;t help it &#8211; try changing your phone and desktop background to a photo/creative that represents a fat zero or an empty wallet. This little activity will take the excitement out of your usual online haul.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Saving money the elite way: follow the 48-hour rule</h2>



<p>So you saw this really cool thing online, and you can&#8217;t wait to move the item from your virtual cart to your home. Give the item 48 hours before you buy it. You will only buy something that you really need, which makes your day-to-day tasks more manageable. Impulse buys = temporary happiness. Studies show that the joy of impulse buy is momentary, and an individual feels more stressed to have not saved that money. One of the best ways to cut expenses and save money is to give any buy 48 hours of consideration &#8211; if you really need it, you will be back to purchase it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our best money saving tip: Use cash instead of cards</h2>

<p>This trick is relatively simple but highly effective. If you have a specific weekly spending amount, encash it and use it for all your week&#8217;s purchases. This way, you will be able to track your expenditure and keep tabs on how much is left. Moreover, cards have a way of making us feel less guilty about our purchases and expenses. With cash, the parting pain is much greater compared to plastic tapping and swiping.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Explore cheaper plans</h2>



<p>Our phone and television plans can sum up to be quite hefty. Revaluate your needs based on your consumption. Choose the subscriptions that fit your lifestyle. You can alternatively <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/keep-track-expenses-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">decide to split television or online app plans with your roomis</a> to make it more sustainable. Remember, there are always cheaper plans and subscriptions available in the market which can help you save a lot of money.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bargain!! </h2>

<p>This is by far, the easiest of all the money saving tips that exist. Thrift shopping is like treasure hunting; one won&#8217;t know what they might find. These places say that they have fixed prices, but you can always talk sweetly in conversation. And with bulk buying, and you could bargain for a better price.
