<p>Just a few days left before we bid goodbye to 2021, and what’s more exciting than the end of the year? A fresh start to literally everything! From changing your perspective to building a new you— dropping habits you don’t like and picking ones that will feed your soul. With that being said, the first place to start work on the <strong>‘new year, new me’ is with your home.</strong> If improving your home isn’t already one of your New Year’s resolutions, keep reading to find out why it should be!</p>



<p><strong>HOME IMPROVEMENT IDEAS FOR THE NEW YEAR</strong></p>



<p>Now is the time to declutter, organize and transform your apartment into a beautiful sanctuary you can call home. And, friends, we are here to help you keep your new year’s resolution with these easy home improvement ideas and DIY apartment hacks that will blow your mind! Let’s get started with the first very important one ??</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-declutter">1. <strong>DECLUTTER</strong></h2>



<p>Step one: DECLUTTER (and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/decluttering-101-to-be-or-not-to-be-messy/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make our mothers proud</a>). By going through your belongings, you’ll be able to decide which things to hold on to and which to toss. Set aside a day (or two!) to go through your clothes, appliances, and tools. Make a pile of things to donate, things to keep, and things to throw away. Don’t stop there, go through the rest of the apartment. Is there anything you can gift or donate? Once you’ve finished, go through the fridge and pantry and tackle that expired food.</p>



<p>While you’re decluttering your physical space, it’s also a great time to declutter your mental and financial areas. Reevaluate your subscriptions. Everyone loves Netflix, but how often are you reading that print magazine subscription? Do you really need everything in your beauty box, or have you found your favorite products by now? Be wise about the things you decide to spend your hard-earned money on.</p>

<p>When you’re done with the sorting phase, do a deep clean. Sweep and mop the floors, wash the dishes, wipe down the counters and dust surfaces, wash the windows, the whole nine yards. When your apartment is free of superfluous items, you can make better decisions about what you want the vibe of your place to be and how to respect that direction in the coming year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-create-creative-space-solutions">3. <strong>CREATE CREATIVE SPACE SOLUTIONS</strong></h2>



<p>We ALL need more storage than we’re currently getting. For you, this could be as simple as two under-the-bed rolling bins. If you really need much more space, consider renting a small storage unit for the things you don’t use regularly. You can also consider apartment hacks like using magnetic storage, getting multi-purpose furniture, and using vertical solutions to maximize space. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/diy-closet-organizer-hacks-to-take-your-closet-from-0-to-100/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1640870647814165&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FNRJRXjj_zAqP2Qxb6m9C">limited-space solutions</a> just waiting to be utilized.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-check-in">4. <strong>CHECK-IN</strong></h2>



<p>The next big step in preparing your apartment for 2022 is to verify that everything works. This means double-checking your heating and air conditioning, servicing your large appliances, and checking/changing batteries (think smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, roku remotes, back-up flashlights). This includes running a routine cleaning on your washing machine, dishwasher, and oven. This is also a great time to re-up on renter’s insurance. Make sure all of your most precious belongings are covered by your policy and claim any damages or repairs that need to be done.</p>

<p>Now we’re getting to the fun part! Once you’ve finished the necessary evils, you can bring your design vision to life. If you haven’t already done this, New Year is a great opportunity to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/the-greatest-design-hacks-for-your-small-apartment/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">make your apartment your personal urban sanctuary</a>. Here you can spend as much or as little time and money as you’d like.</p>



<p>You can invest in a great new work of art to hang. Find cost-effective prints online, create your <a href="https://www.printful.com/blog/poster-ideas" class="broken_link">own poster designs</a>, or support your community by buying from a local artist<strong>.</strong> Create an accent wall with paint or professional wallpaper <a href="https://paintboise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">painting contractors</a>. Add new peel-and-stick floors or wall tiles to liven up your space. Apply contact paper to your countertops. Find second-hand furniture to do a DIY flip. The options are endless.</p>



<p>If none—or all—of this is up to your alley, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/tips-on-how-to-brighten-up-your-apartment-with-plants/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1640870647816343&amp;usg=AOvVaw0B3n83C4cLgBzH-RrDq_As">plants</a> are another inexpensive way to give your home that inviting touch. Buying from a nursery is great, but propagating plants can be just as satisfying. If you have friends with apartments giving jungle vibes, we suggest asking them. You can take cuttings to begin your own little plant family. Chances are they’ll be excited to share. You can find ones that need very little attention and add a great deal of visual interest to your space.</p>



<p>If nothing else, the simplest, cheapest, and easiest refresh can come from rearranging furniture. Work with what you have. Restyle your room or DIY upgrade your existing pieces. Another way to reduce costs is by splitting them. If you have a roommate, ask them if they’re interested in taking on the projects together to divide the cost and workload. If you don’t have a roommate already, consider using Roomi to find your perfect match! Alternatively, ask family or friends if they have any old furniture to give you. If you don’t see yourself as an interior designer, no worries! We can suggest plenty of easy <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/cheap-life-hacks-to-turn-your-new-apartment-into-a-home/1694/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1640870647841992&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Xc_XhWBfGskpXe4BNOf2b" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">home improvement ideas</a> to ignite your creative spark!</p>

<p>Lastly, the best gift you can give yourself in 2022 is to create new and lasting routines. You know yourself better than anyone else. Whether you’re a Type-A organizer or you prefer to go with the flow, you can benefit from some basic routine advice. Put your bills and other essential payments on autopay. Staying on top of financial commitments can really help alleviate anxiety and unnecessary stress.</p>



<p>Create a daily, weekly, and monthly cleaning schedule. Do you prefer to go to bed with the sink empty, or is the morning when you feel most inspired to take on daily housework? Decide what your cleanliness priorities are and give yourself a window of time to dedicate to each one. And once a month—for the love of all things good—deep clean your apartment. This will keep the yearly review short and sweet.</p>



<p>The New Year doesn’t have to be a big and daunting event. While entirely remodeling your apartment might not be possible, you can set yourself up for success by attempting some of these DIY home improvement ideas. Try adding at least two of these apartment hacks into your 2022 New Year’s resolutions, and let us know in the comments if you have other tips!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>New Year’s Eve is a time when many people want to have fun, let their hair down and celebrate with friends and family. But as we recover from the pandemic that swept through our streets this year, it’s a good idea to remain cautious. New variants of the Covid-19 virus are still being observed in several parts of the world. For some of us, this will mean hosting our festive celebrations entirely online. However, for those of us who’ve been vaccinated, there are also some brilliant in-person New Year’s Eve party ideas that are both safe and fun.</p>

Whether you host your parties online or offline, there are plenty of ways to celebrate with your loved ones and give them your best wishes for the coming year. We have some brilliant New Year’s Eve party ideas in store for you to fill your celebrations with joy and laughter.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="glow-up-your-apartment-with-new-year-s-decorations">Glow up your apartment with New Year’s Decorations</h2>



<p>Blow up the balloons and hang up the fairy lights by all means. But there are so many New Year’s Eve party ideas for decor to make the occasion Instagrammable! Here are some fun ways to jazz up your space and welcome 2022.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-have-an-nye-theme">1. Have an NYE theme</h3>



<p>Working around a theme can make your decorations unique and quirky. You can work with a color palette and add more accessories to highlight the theme. You can also choose to make it glamorous or minimalistic to fit your style. Make your own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHjE7pSxXk0">disco ball</a> for a vibrant disco-themed party. A Roaring Twenties party theme will also call for lots of glitters! Alternatively, you could fast forward to a futuristic setting and add bold neon signs. Don’t forget the props and costumes to match!</p>

<p>If too much bling is not your thing, you may want to go for a more elegant NYE aesthetic. Try Winter Wonderland style decor with paper-cut snowflakes and pine cones on a white backdrop. You could also try a <a href="https://liagriffith.com/our-boho-glam-new-years-eve-party/?sscid=c1k5_kulwn">bohemian theme</a> for a warm and welcoming gathering. Arrange a low, comfortable seating area and decorate the space with artificial feathers, printed sheets, and some gold accents. A pajama party or movie marathon session will also work perfectly with simple New Year’s decorations.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-create-a-countdown-wall">2. Create a countdown wall</h3>



<p>The countdown to the coming year is the most awaited part of any New Year’s Eve party. A countdown wall can also make for an excellent photo opportunity. <a href="https://thehousethatlarsbuilt.com/2017/12/countdown-to-midnight-backdrop.html/">Create a wall art</a> clock with bold arrow hands and have fun posing with friends in the lead up to midnight. Use your art and craft skills to make some cardboard cutouts and stick them up. Or else, you can use balloons to stick your numbers on and put them up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-photo-backdrop">3. Photo backdrop</h3>



<p>If not a countdown wall, you could create a festive photo backdrop to snap some memorable moments. You can make a simple fringe curtain or spruce up a wall with gold balloons for glamorous parties. A curtain made of feathers and beads will work beautifully for a bohemian theme. And don’t forget the photo props for some extra fun!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-best-new-year-games"><strong>What are the best New Year games?</strong></h2>



<p>Whether you do a pajama party or a dance fest, New Year&#8217;s games can be the best way to break the ice in an intimate party hosted online or offline. Here are some exciting New Year’s Eve party ideas for games that you must try!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="nye-charades">NYE Charades</h3>



<p>The classic game of charades is ideal for filling the room with laughter. There are multiple themes to choose from, so you can opt for something that most people in the room are familiar with. Movie names are often a popular choice! Write the names on tiny slips of paper and divide everyone into two groups. Every person will come up once to pick a slip and act out the theme without speaking. Their team members then have to guess the right name to score a point.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="card-games-for-new-year-celebrations">Card Games for New Year Celebrations</h3>



<p>Interesting card games can be the best way to socialize at a party and get to know everyone. Fill-in-the-blanks games like Cards against Humanity can pull out fun anecdotes and the best jokes to laugh out loud. You could also organize a poker tournament to fill the room with competitive energy or arrange printables for prompt games recapping the year’s highlights.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="guessing-the-resolutions">Guessing the Resolutions</h3>



<p>Resolutions are one of the most popular New Year topics, so why not make a fun game out of them? You can ask everyone to write their resolutions on a slip of paper and put them in a box. You can then pick them out and guess who the resolution belongs to. Alternatively, try Two Resolutions and A Lie to make the game more interesting.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="virtual-scenario-games">Virtual scenario games</h3>



<p>If you’re hosting an NYE party online, virtual games can be the best of New Year’s Eve party ideas to get started with the fun. <a href="https://teambuilding.com/blog/virtual-murder-mystery" class="broken_link">Murder mystery</a> may sound like a subject for Halloween but it can be super fun with an online group. Plus, there are all kinds of themes to choose from. You can also go play the good old Bingo and even create your own <a href="https://teambuilding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/virtual-new-years-bingo.jpg" class="broken_link">templates with interesting captions</a>. Trivia games, Two Truths And a Lie, and guessing resolutions, are also perfect for virtual settings.</p>
