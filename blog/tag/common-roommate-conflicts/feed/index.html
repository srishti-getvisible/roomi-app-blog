<p>Having roommates can be good practice for when you eventually become an adult. Whether you are living with a roommate for the first time or you&#8217;re changing roommates, the experience can be awesome!</p>



<p>Sure, clashes may happen. They are bound to, given that you are individuals that share different interests and possibly come from different backgrounds. Sharing WiFi with roommates is one such area where you might come across some problems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Am I a bad person for not wanting to share my WiFi?</h2>



<p>Nah! There are a thousand and one reasons why you may not want to share your WiFi, especially when the requests become incessant. Sometimes it may be that you are on a tight budget and sharing will impact you financially. At other times, it may be that you don&#8217;t see any reason to share when your roommate also has an active internet subscription.</p>



<p>Perhaps you already specified what things and roles you would like shared in your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sign-roommate-agreement/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommates&#8217; agreement</a>. Maybe it is that sharing makes you feel cheated. Whatever the case, not sharing WiFi with your roommate does not make you a bad person.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to know if someone is stealing your WiFi</h2>



<p>Even if you don&#8217;t want to share your WiFi, if you&#8217;re not careful, your roommate can still access it. Here are three ways you can recognize if someone is stealing your WiFi</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Check your indicator light</h3>



<p>This is perhaps the easiest way to know if someone has unauthorized access to your WiFi. If your router’s light is on even when all your wireless devices are off, then you know that someone has hacked into your WiFi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Check your router’s device list</h3>



<p>Type in the specified router IP address into your browser. Once you are logged in, look for ‘Attached devices’ or ‘Device list’. If you notice any IP address other than yours on the list, then someone is using your WiFi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Check your security settings</h3>



<p>If you notice that your roommate is sharing your WiFi without authorization, then you may need to make your device more secure. You can do this by utilizing the WPA2 or WPS security alongside a complex password which you must update regularly.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with sharing your WiFi as long as it doesn&#8217;t become an incessant or everyday thing. So by all means, go ahead. However, should the sharing request from your roomi become frequent, consider asking your roommate to contribute to the subscription from the outset. If you are both going to pay, then have some form of agreement on usage proportions, because chances are that your internet consumption won&#8217;t be the same.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges to expect when sharing WiFi with roommates</h2>



<p>Several challenges arise when more than one person is using the same internet connection. Some of the most common points to tackle when you&#8217;re sharing WiFi with your roommates are listed below.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Network speed</h3>



<p>Network speed slows down dramatically when more than one person is connected to it. This is especially true when the individual is engaged in a bandwidth-draining activity like online gaming or video streaming. You can fix this by choosing an internet provider with more bandwidth. The more the bandwidth, the less the lag and the faster your browsing experience will be.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Security</h3>



<p>That you are sharing with your roommate alone does not mean the network is not visible to your neighbors. This means that others can as well try to access your internet connection even without authorization. This means that you must encrypt your wireless signals to prevent unauthorized access. Set up a password that no one can guess!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Illegal activities</h3>



<p>If your network provider detects any <a href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/wi-fi-network-criminal-liability.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlawful activity on your service</a>, the bandwidth will be throttled until the illegal activity stops. Unfortunately, only the person whose name is on the wireless network contract can be held responsible. Make it clear in advance that illegal activity is not acceptable, in a roommate agreement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can my roommate see my messages when we share the WiFi?</h2>



<p>Not possible. They may be able to check what apps or websites you’re browsing sometimes, but they would not be able to see your activity on the apps or website. This is because most internet connections and apps are encrypted to make them secure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bottom line</h2>



<p>Whether you choose to share your internet with your roommate or not, ensure you discuss it. If you can&#8217;t, make your reasons clear. And if you can share, have that discussion and agree on who pays what, when, and how this will affect usage. This will go a long way to ensure that sharing your WiFi with your roommate (or not) doesn&#8217;t become a reason for an argument.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a narcissist?</h2>



<p>First off, you must understand <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">narcissistic personality disorder</a>. (NPD) It is a legitimate mental health condition that requires diagnosis by a mental health professional. The term narcissist is widely used interchangeably with NPD and this is a misunderstanding. While there are certain hallmark characteristics of NPD, having them does not necessarily mean you have the condition. A person can exhibit some characteristics of NPD and not actually suffer from it. However, if their narcissism is a strong pattern of behavior, they may be diagnosed with NPD. The first analysis you need to make is if your roommate is suffering from NPD or if they show have narcissistic tendencies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do I identify a narcissist?</h2>



<p>While having these characteristics does not essentially make one a narcissist, these are a few characteristics of one. Being a narcissist or having these tendencies is not the same as having NPD. Hence, it necessary for a medical professional to diagnose NPD. That said, here are some indication that you could be dealing with a narcissist roommate.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dealing with your narcissist roomate</h2>



<p>If you feel that your roommate exhibits a lot of these characteristics, then you could be living with a narcissist roommate. While you can&#8217;t be sure if it is NPD, there are some actions you can take. Narcissists can be very demanding and draining to live with. Hence, it is important that you take steps to deal with their behavior. Here is how you can try to make living with a narcissist roommate a little easier.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Accept who they are</h3>



<p>When they want to, those with narcissistic personalities are great at charming people. You might find yourself drawn to your narcissist roommate and their show of grandiose. These are also particularly popular in work settings or among their colleagues. When it comes to narcissists, they seem to draw all the attention towards themselves. Do not let all of this carry you away or make you react to them. Understand that these tendencies are just the way they are and, are common for people like them. Do not take their actions or words personally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do not try to change them</h3>



<p>The first step in dealing with your narcissist roommate is simply accepting that you cannot change them. Do not expect them to change, or you will just end up disappointed and frustrated. No matter how rationally you try to explain things, they are unlikely to hear you. Arguing with a narcissist may escalate the situation and trigger their inability to handle criticism. You need to understand that there is nothing that you can do to change a narcissist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do not feed their behavior</h3>



<p>Now that you have understood the tendencies of a narcissist, do not fall prey to them. They can make you feel pressured to push aside your own needs to keep them satisfied. They can be extremely demanding of your attention, praise, and obedience. However, it is essential you show them that they cannot bully you into submission. If you think there will be a break in their attention-seeking behavior, it doesn&#8217;t come. Do not humor a narcissist&#8217;s false reality and delusions. No matter how much you try to adjust your life to suit their needs, it is never enough.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Know yourself!</h3>



<p>Your narcissist roommate does not live in reality. Hence, their views of themselves and other people are wildly delusional. Remember this when a narcissist tries to manipulate, gaslight, or bully you. Don’t let their shame and blame strategy and manipulation undermine your self-esteem. The best defense against the insults and projections of the narcissist is your self-esteem. When you know yourself well, you are able to reject any unfair criticisms leveled against you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Have &#8216;the talk&#8217;</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve gone over the situation and made your assessment, it is time for you to sit them down. Let them know honestly but in a sensitive and friendly way. Put your foot down and don&#8217;t budge if they are being unreasonable. Avoid confronting them in a public space or in front of a large group of people as this can trigger them. They may react aggressively and fight back to save face. Hence, be ready to back off if you feel the situation could escalate. All the best!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let them go</h3>



<p>Maybe you have tried your best to accept who they are and deal with them. However, they still make living absolutely unbearable. This doesn&#8217;t need to be the case. It may be time to cut off your narcissist roommate. There are many fish (potential roommates) in the sea (city.) If they don&#8217;t value you, it could be time to search for a new roommate. Lucky for you, you&#8217;re already in the right place!</p>



<p>Roomi can help you find roommates and find one who is the right living partner for you. Better luck this time. Choose well!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All we want is to&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/">find a good roommate in NYC</a>! Is it too much to ask? In fact, at Roomi, we&#8217;ve been successfully&nbsp;matching New Yorkers with their dream place&nbsp;for years now. But, what if you and your roommate skipping hand-in-hand along Broadway isn&#8217;t a reality? What if you&#8217;re experiencing conflicts and you&#8217;re unsure how to resolve them? Well, it&#8217;s 2020, and that means we can&nbsp;get away with using 2020-type methods of communication. The text message!&nbsp;<a href="https://bearworks.missouristate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4014&amp;context=theses" class="broken_link">Studies suggest that it is better to manage common roommate conflicts through text messages</a>&nbsp;rather than confrontation. Because texting your roomie gives them time to analyze their mistakes and act accordingly. It also gives you enough time to string your thoughts and watch your tone.</p>



<p>So in this article, Roomi will help you resolve common roommate conflicts by showing you how to craft the perfect text!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let&#8217;s look at the most common roommate conflicts!</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#1  Their friends or partner are over too often!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/Uq5d1nsKUShv6Vlomt/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/Uq5d1nsKUShv6Vlomt/giphy.gif"/></figure>



<p>You agreed to live with&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;person, and all of a sudden, it feels like your place is overrun! There&#8217;s their SO, friends, colleagues, classmates, neighbors, and grandma&#8217;s dog! All roommates enjoy others to have guests over, but not ATM. Loud chatting, higher electricity bills, and a bathroom that’s always occupied? If this sounds familiar, grab your phone and text your roomie this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Hey! Are you free to talk about our guest policy in the apartment later? Your [friends/partner] are great, but they&#8217;re over a lot, and I don&#8217;t feel like I get much space at home. I think it would help if we limited the number of times we each have guests over to [x] per week. Is that ok with you?</strong></p></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#2 They don&#8217;t clean up after themselves!</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/WxzhpsnJMV4q6yGvGf/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/WxzhpsnJMV4q6yGvGf/giphy.gif"/></figure></div>



<p>Dealing with a messy roomi takes its toll – no one likes seeing dirty dishes in the sink or overflowing trash cans in the kitchen. This is a common roommate conflict! Remember that two people often have different definitions of what &#8220;mess&#8221; actually is! However, there are basic standards that everyone can and should adhere to. If this is becoming an ongoing issue, text your roomie:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Hey! I don&#8217;t mean to nag, but the apartment has been really messy lately, and I feel like I&#8217;m cleaning up after you often. Those [dishes/frying pans/wine glasses] have been on the counter for a few days, and I can&#8217;t get to the sink to do my own washing up. Would you mind checking up on your mess when you&#8217;re home?</strong></p></blockquote>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/help-my-roommate-is-driving-me-up-the-wall-roomi/">Related: Help! My Roommate is the Most Annoying Person on the Planet!</a></pre>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3 Heating &amp; cooling debates!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/l4FATJpd4LWgeruTK/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FATJpd4LWgeruTK/giphy.gif"/></figure>



<p>You like a cool, comfortable apartment, but your roomi cranks up the heating at any given opportunity. If you feel yourself sweating at home, send a text to come to an agreement before a fight really heats up. Remember that some people feel temperature differently; don&#8217;t assume that everyone shares the same perception as you. Text your roomie:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Hey! I noticed the heating in the apartment keeps getting cranked up really high! I kinda keep sweating whenever I&#8217;m home. Maybe I&#8217;m naturally hotter than you are, but can we agree on a constant temperature? A good standard room temperature is around 70 – maybe we can try that and see if it&#8217;s comfortable for both of us before I melt!</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4 Damages!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/netflix-santa-clarita-diet-67urFpVn7qwcd2gWIl"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/67urFpVn7qwcd2gWIl/giphy.gif?resize=540%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="Drew Barrymore Oops GIF by NETFLIX - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="540" height="540" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>So, they broke a lamp, spilled coffee on the sofa, or scratched the flooring. However, your roomie hasn&#8217;t brought up the mistake with you. The issue here is that damage beyond general wear-and-tear could affect how much deposit you get back. Leaving&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;of you out of pocket. Wait a day or two after noticing the damage, as they may have already made steps to fix the problem. If you hear nothing, text your roomie this:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Hey! I noticed [x] is damaged. These things happen, but I just wanted to make sure you&#8217;ve contacted a [cleaner/tradesperson] to get it fixed? Let me know if you haven&#8217;t had a chance, and I&#8217;ll look for someone who can help. I&#8217;ll pass the number onto you as I&#8217;d like to get it fixed as soon as possible to make sure we get our full deposit back when we leave!</strong></p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5 They stole your food! (Most common roommate conflict in the history of coliving)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.giphy.com/media/XECiLxeHvwdD96Jc6Z/giphy.gif?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="https://media.giphy.com/media/XECiLxeHvwdD96Jc6Z/giphy.gif"/></figure>



<p>This by far is the most common roommate conflict! When your snacks and leftovers keep going missing, it can be infuriating; we get it! Skip the face-to-face conflict(no one should have to see you get all red-faced over missing cookies). Instead, text your roomie something that&#8217;s straight to the point:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Hey! My [leftover stir fry/chips and salsa] have gone missing, and I wondered if you&#8217;ve taken them by mistake? It&#8217;s cool if you have, I just want to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again because I can&#8217;t afford to buy more groceries each week. I can start labeling my food to avoid us getting confused in the future if that helps.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Roomi advice:</strong>&nbsp;If sending your roomie a text doesn&#8217;t work, a face-to-face conversation should be your next approach. It&#8217;s much easier to build connections and convey emotions when someone can actually see us. Make sure to talk it out with your roomie after addressing things that bother you.</p>

<p>Sometimes your roommate-and as a result, your roommate problems- comes as a package deal. Maybe they have an untrained pet. Or maybe they have a partner who refuses to leave your apartment! So, you can look past the hand-holding on the sofa, the odd lover’s tiff and even the sickly baby names. But, what do you do if you really, really don’t like your roommate’s partner?! How do you deal with your roommates (and their partners) then?!</p>



<p>Your living situation can become even more uncomfortable if <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deal-roommates-significant-never-leaves/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">your roommate’s partner never leaves</a>, and when you’re feeling like an unwanted third wheel in your own apartment, it’s time to address the romantic issue in front of you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I don&#8217;t like my roommate&#8217;s partner cuz they&#8217;re annoying </h2>



<p>Do you feel irritated because you’re forking out for NYC-tier rent every month and they pay nothing to share your tiny space? Is it because they’re taking long showers every morning and making you late for your (already painful) commute? Or is it something more specific that you don&#8217;t like about your roommate&#8217;s partner?</p>



<p>The more generalized issues &#8211; like they’re around all the time, taking your share of the hot water &#8211; can usually be solved with a chat with your roommate. These are pretty common roommate problems that shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to fix. Approach the issue when the S.O isn’t in the house and try to gently set some boundaries. Talk about how many nights per week you’re comfortable with them being around, and discuss a morning schedule so you can use the bathroom when you need it. Initiating talking to your roommate can be hard. Just tell them that you’re on a tight budget and can’t afford to pay the extra electricity bill each month. and that your boss gets annoyed when you’re late for work, you should be able to come to an agreement. You should deal with your roommate&#8217;s partner the way you deal with your roommates who are inconsiderate!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I don&#8217;t like my roommate&#8217;s partner because they make me uneasy</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6ml4x1/i_hate_my_roommates_boyfriend/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">isabellekinza told Reddit</a> about the problems she was having with her roommate’s partner:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“My roommate went home for a couple of weeks for the summer. But he didn&#8217;t leave. In fact, he basically moved in. And this guy makes me uncomfortable. He doesn&#8217;t make passes at me or anything, in fact apart from casual greetings we don&#8217;t talk, but his presence makes me uncomfortable.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I&#8217;m generally a loud and blunt person, but put me in a room with him and I clam up. Which is how I allowed him to berate me for leaving dishes in the sink (for less than a day). Then he told me I wasn&#8217;t cleaning up after myself enough. Which was ironic since the mess he was complaining about was his. I argued weakly but my spine crumbles around him so I angrily cleaned the mess.</em></p><p><em>Then here comes the kicker. Right before my roommate got back the internet stopped working. I couldn&#8217;t log in, and my first thought was that he&#8217;d tampered with it since the internet is in his name and me and my roommate pay him in cash for it. I put that thought down to petty vindictiveness on my part.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>So, this morning, I messaged him. It takes me five minutes to word it nicely in a non accusatory way, and I send it. An hour later he replies saying that he changed the password because I didn&#8217;t pay him.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>It can be tempting to treat your roommate’s partner with hostility or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/2017/05/24/5-common-behaviors-passive-aggressive-roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">passive-aggressiveness</a> in times like this, but that usually just worsens the situation. Dealing with this kind of roommate problems can be a little more tricky.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So, how do you deal with your roommates now?</h3>



<p>Again, you could talk to your roommate about how you’re feeling. They may be blissfully unaware of the issue in their home, their judgement clouded by a rosy veil of love! In all likelihood, your roommate&#8217;s partner isn&#8217;t intentionally trying to make you uncomfortable. So, just talk to them!</p>



<p>If that doesn’t work, it’s time to contact your landlord. There could be terms in your contract that specify the number of guests you can have over at a time. And your roommate&#8217;s partner overstaying their welcome could technically present a hazard. </p>

<p>The city administrative code says that every individual living in a residential building should have “a livable area of not less than 80 square feet”. There is no state/city law in place that requires renters to tell their landlords about visitors. But it&#8217;s still worth checking your lease agreement. Some individual landlords add guest-related clauses that could work in your favor. While ideally you should deal with your roommate&#8217;s partner by communicating with them directly. But sometimes it&#8217;s just not possible to deal with your roommate problems this way. Speaking with your landlord is the only way to deal with your roommates. </p>



<p>Make your landlord aware of the issue to discuss your options. If they can’t do anything about your roommate’s partner, then it might be time to look for a new place. There are thousands of great potential roommates out there. The most important thing is that you feel safe and happy in your own home! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides eating the rest of a leftover pizza, a roommate paying rent late is a fairly common roommate misdemeanor. Of course, once in a while, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-things-to-do-if-you-cant-make-rent-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">anyone</a> can fall behind. But if your roommate is paying the rent late every month, you&#8217;ve got a problem. Unfortunately, there are no roommate police as of yet and rent still needs to be paid. For those who have found themselves in this unfortunate circumstance- here is what to do when your roommate is late paying rent.</span> </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do you approach your roommate who is paying the rent late?</strong></h2>



<p><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step to resolving the issue is understanding why it’s occurring. Respectfully reach out to your roommate to genuinely understand why their portion of rent is late. This can help you decide what moral code you are willing to uphold. Keep in mind, your roommate is legally bound by a lease, so don’t take on more than you can handle.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>Zero tolerance </b>towards paying rent late</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this approach to the situation you have to keep a few things in mind. The first is that this cannot become habit. The ol’ nip-it-in-the-bud tactic is required. It’s understanding when emergencies come up, but handling someone else’s responsibilities, even in a small crisis, is not the way to go about it and may set you up to be a doormat. If the zero tolerance approach is something you’re capable of doing, then execute it swiftly and efficiently. Rent is late, if they do not pay up you find another roommate or arrange to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-happens-roommate-breaks-lease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sublease</a>.</span></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b><strong>One and done</strong></b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the situation your roommate has found themselves in is so bad it’s understandable and almost relatable. You have now agreed to cover them this month- just this once. Get your agreement in writing. Type up a simple contract with its conditions. Though not legally binding, this is a good way to give your roommate a deadline or due date to return to you their portion of rent. Do not accept on the terms that they pay your portion of rent next month. This leaves four weeks for a hit and run to occur. After all, they have already proven their unreliability.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Resolution</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have sought understanding and chosen to be tolerant or not, here are some long term decisions to consider in order to avoid or improve the situation. Have a heart to heart. If your roommates circumstance appears to be that of a habitual nature, express how detrimental being late or not paying rent can be to you and themselves. Evictions and damaged credit are hard hitters the next time you move. Speak to the landlord about adding another roommate- more people, less rent. If your landlord is accommodating it is also possible to <a href="https://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/changing-your-lease-or-rental-agreement" class="broken_link">modify</a> the lease depending on the circumstance. Be open with your roommate about talking to the landlord in order to protect your own finances.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Avoid guilt trips or personal vendettas</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Money matters should not be taken personally, it&#8217;s simply not worth. Don’t keep the issue from your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/20-questions-to-ask-your-landlord-before-you-move-in-roomi/">landlord</a>, and reach out to your roommate to collectively resolve the problem. </span></p>
