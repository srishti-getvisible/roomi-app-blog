										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ride-sharing apps have become the norm for people who don&#8217;t want to drive a car or use a cab. Sometimes it&#8217;s safer and more convenient to leave the driving and traffic headaches to someone else. Ride-hailing apps have revolutionized how we get about and may help you save a lot of money on travel expenditures. Especially during the pandemic in New York City, there&#8217;s been a shift from <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains/">subways</a> to Uber or Lyft, the two most popular ride-sharing apps. But is one better than the other?</p>



<p>So without any further ado, here’s our comprehensive guide: Uber or Lyft for traveling around NYC.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-is-better-uber-or-lyft-in-nyc">Which is better, Uber or Lyft in NYC?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lyft-offers-better-customer-service">Lyft offers better customer service</h3>



<p>You want quick customer assistance when anything goes wrong, especially if your money is on the line. Email, website, in-app help, and an emergency line are all available by both apps.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, both companies have fallen behind on customer service as they have expanded, but Lyft has received higher overall <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k11345115-Lyft_vs_uber-New_York_City_New_York.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">customer service</a> scores. Uber&#8217;s support section includes a lot of predefined solutions, whereas Lyft takes more time with specific concerns and delivers more clear answers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-they-cost-more-or-less-the-same">They cost more or less the same!</h3>



<p>Basic rideshare costs for both are approximately $1 to start, $2 per mile, and $0.25 per minute. Actual pricing depends on the base fare, distance traveled, drive duration, and a flat booking charge. Prices for both services might fluctuate <em>depending on demand and traffic</em>, making it difficult to determine which is less expensive at any one time. For example, if there are fewer drivers on the road during rush hour, any app may be more expensive, costing up to 1.5 times the regular fee.</p>

<p>Uber and Lyft both have several pooling options to help you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-save-money-while-living-in-midtown-east-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">save money</a>. You share your trip with other nearby passengers for a cheaper fee in carpooling ride-shares. Although carpooling takes longer than regular rides, but it&#8217;s significantly less expensive.</p>



<p>Uber&#8217;s ride-sharing service is UberPool, whereas Lyft provides Shared and Shared Saver rides. Before booking your journey, you may check out your carpooling possibilities on both. UberPool rides need a short walk to a convenient meeting place for the driver. Also, Lyft&#8217;s Shared Saver rides require a short walk, whereas Shared rides do not.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi Tip: A shared ride on Uber or Lyft doesn’t guarantee your driver will pick someone else up, but the discounts apply regardless.</strong></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-safety-measures-a-close-run">Safety Measures: A close run</h3>



<p>Uber and Lyft take driver and passenger safety seriously, taking proactive measures to keep riders as safe as possible. Both businesses use comparable safety precautions, including background checks, giving riders&nbsp;driver information, and panic buttons in the app. Riders may check the name of their driver, car model and color, and license number.</p>

<p>Uber&#8217;s app also includes a <a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/sharing-eta-and-trip-status?nodeId=e1f8ed2b-c0e5-4456-9c73-552cf11c5581" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">RideCheck</a> function that helps users stay safe. This function is said to employ GPS data and sensors to identify unusual behavior in Uber&#8217;s app. Lyft has recently added new <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/lyft-announces-smart-trip-check-in-after-sexual-assault-allegations/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">safety features</a> to the app, including the ability to call 911 within the app. Moreover, it sends your location to emergency services and for the app to detect when a ride has &#8220;unexpected delays&#8221;.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-subscription-plans-which-is-better-uber-or-lyft">Subscription Plans: Which is better, Uber or Lyft?</h3>



<p>Both Uber and Lyft offer subscription options for frequent users, but it&#8217;s important to know which one can save you more money. Regardless of traffic, weather, or time of day, Uber&#8217;s Journey Pass subscription service for UberX and Uber Pool claims to &#8220;consistently&#8221; save you money on each ride. Uber claims that you can save up to 15%, but that amount is subject to change. Also, it&#8217;s unclear if you&#8217;ll save more than 10% or closer to 15%.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s a little too generic, especially considering Ride Pass costs $25 each month.</p>

<p>Lyft offers more subscription plans than Uber, giving users additional alternatives if they don&#8217;t use the service daily. Lyft also offers a <a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001541868-Lyft-Pass" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Commute Plan and a Personal Plan</a>, which differ from the Smart Savings and All Access plans.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-ride-hailing-app-wins-uber-or-lyft">Which ride-hailing app wins: Uber or Lyft?</h2>



<p>Uber caters to business travelers, offering a quiet and professional ride from point A to point B. In contrast, Lyft&#8217;s catchphrase &#8220;Your Friend with a Car&#8221; is quite evident as customers can have a joyful and friendly conversation with the drivers.</p>



<p>Team Roomi favors Lyft for its many small benefits, including a slightly better high-demand pricing reputation and a more convenient support channel. Moreover, it also creates a more personalized user experience. If you&#8217;re a US-based frequent rider, Lyft&#8217;s new <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/introducing-lyft-pink" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pink subscription service</a> may be the best option to help you save some money.</p>

<p>However, if you want more features- estimated arrival time before booking a ride, Uber caters to that better. With Lyft, you have to request a ride first to get an ETA. Further, with Uber, there are way more types of rides available. Due to the availability of more luxury car services, riders have more opportunities to get matched to commercially licensed professional drivers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Aah yes, we’ve come around to asking this age old question again: should you get an Uber or a taxi to get around NYC? Uber has taken over all major cities around the world, including NYC. So, it’s no surprise that that might be the go-to for most youngsters in the city. But there&#8217;s just something so iconic about the NYC yellow taxi cab. I mean, you can’t really picture the city without thinking of those yellow cabs driving all over NYC. It’s practically the soul of the city. But as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-subway-crime.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Uber</a> has taken over the city in the past few years, we’ve all found ourselves asking- which option is better? And more importantly, which one is cheaper?</p>



<p>Whether you’ve just <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-perks-of-co-living-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> to NYC and genuinely want to know or just bored at home with nothing else to do, we’ve got all the info you need! So without any further ado, here’s our comprehensive guide traveling around NYC: Cab addition!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nyc-taxi-or-uber-which-is-better">NYC Taxi or Uber: Which is better?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-an-uber-better-than-a-taxi-in-nyc">Is an Uber better than a Taxi in NYC?</h3>



<p>We don’t need to explain to you what uber is, you’ve probably already used it a hundred times. But even if you haven’t they’re actually not that different from a regular taxi. In fact, they’re pretty similar to a yellow taxi cab in how they calculate fares. It’s a combination of the time and distance with an additional fare of any tolls added at the&nbsp; end.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-ll-need-a-phone">You’ll need a phone!</h3>



<p>But of course, the big difference is, you need a working smartphone and an internet connection to book yourself an Uber. So, if you ever find yourself with a dead phone in NYC, uber is not an option for you. Unless, of course, you want to endure the humiliation of going up to a total stranger and asking to use their phone (which, just FYI, is a terrible choice in NYC).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rating-system-ftw">Rating system FTW!</h3>



<p>But there’s a lot of ways in which Uber proves itself to be very useful. First of all, you get to check the rating of the Driver (and they get to see yours as well). If they’ve got a good rating, you can get in the Uber without much stress. You can even share your ride with a friend to be even more cautious.</p>



<p>Uber is also extremely proactive about getting <a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/how-to-contact-support?_csid=tftARz7iRs3LbSqoWjt0Cg&amp;nodeId=4c69afef-5739-4842-9e98-ed0087b873db&amp;state=kjQb7yU1l8Giz_5UZEvEVLc2sdpdNSn6EO12tCipZ4M%3D" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">feedback</a> from the customer. So, if you have a bad experience, you can report it instantly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-availability">Availability!</h3>



<p>Uber is especially useful if you find yourselves in the Suburbs of NYC. Because, while taxi cabs are abundant in the city, you’ll have a real hard time flagging one down once you’re out in the suburbs.</p>



<p>So, now that you’ve got a pretty well-rounded understanding of getting an Uber in NYC, let’s move onto yellow taxis!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-a-taxi-better-than-uber-in-nyc">Is a Taxi better than Uber in NYC?</h3>



<p>Oh what can we say about the New York yellow taxi cab that hasn’t been said before? I mean, it’s an indispensable part of the NYC experience. Just watch any of the thousand movies set in NYC, and we’re sure you’ll find at least a dozen taxis in all the outdoor shots. Yeah, it’s an integral part of the city. But of course, times have changed and perhaps, the taxi might be one of those things that will slowly fade away. After all, aren’t all these new transportation apps supposed to be cheaper anyway?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-actually-cheaper">It’s actually cheaper!</h3>



<p>You’d think that but, surprisingly no, a taxi cab is still cheaper than an Uber in NYC. To be precise, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03021" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> from the University of Cambridge has found that a taxi cab is generally cheaper for shorter trips. Once a trip costs more than $35, then an Uber is likely going to be cheaper for you. But even then, it’s a toss up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-readily-available">Readily Available</h3>



<p>Yellow taxi cabs are everywhere in NYC. Honestly, just wave once as you’re standing at the curb and you’ll find like 10 taxis. Of course, be prepared to be yelled at if flag down a taxi around for no reason in NYC. You don’t need a smartphone or an internet connection to get a taxi, one flailing arm will do. So, if you’re in the City and in need of a cab immediately, a yellow taxi wins hands down!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-customer-service-and-feedback">Customer service and feedback</h3>



<p>It’s not unheard of to have a bad experience with your cab driver. But the procedure to report such an incident is not as instant as it is with Uber. For starters, The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission mandates that all taxis have a passenger bill of rights inside the cab that drivers and cab owners must adhere to. If you want to file an official complaint, you need to dial 311 or go online and report the incident through this <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/filing-complaint-with-tlc.page" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">form</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-who-wins-the-uber-vs-taxi-debate-in-nyc">So, who wins the Uber vs. Taxi debate in NYC?</h2>



<p>Well, both an Uber and a Taxi have their pros and cons in NYC. Of course, team Roomi will always suggest the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/roomis-guide-to-new-yorks-subway-trains/">subway</a> if you’re in NYC. But we understand that many people aren’t yet comfortable taking the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-subway-crime.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">subway</a> because of the pandemic. But if a cab is your only option, we recommend going with an NYC yellow taxi. It’s cheaper, easily available and honestly, it’s an integral part of living in NYC that you must enjoy at least once!</p>

<p>At the end of a long commute, you just want to get the hell away from the subway. But it&#8217;s worth taking a second look around to familiarise yourself with the stations you visit frequently. This becomes crucial on the C and G lines as trains don&#8217;t always extend for the full length of the track.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just so rewarding to be able to calculate the train door closest to the exit, from the station you enter! This could make all the difference in your mood as well as your transit time!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be very (very) mindful of what you eat (or drink).</h2>

<p>There may be train systems that don&#8217;t let you finish your bagel. But New Yorkers don&#8217;t stand by that kind of thinking. The cops will NOT be called on you if you decide to finish your coffee or sandwich mid-transit.</p>



<p>However, your odds of becoming a viral sensation increase, along with the olfactory intensity. So try to avoid chowing down on anything too strong in order to spare your fellow commuters. (This also goes for food that will make the subway messier than it already is.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep moving! <em>especially when you leave a station.</em></h2>

<p>This cannot be repeated enough. When you exit a station, walk some steps forward, <em>even if you don&#8217;t know where you are.</em></p>



<p>This will prevent you from coming in other people&#8217;s way. And also from people walking directly into your back. Or worse, causing a traffic jam of people, just because you stopped walking when you shouldn&#8217;t have.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like high school hallways, where getting your bearings is important, sure. But don’t jam up the works by not getting the hell out of the way, y&#8217;know?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Common-sense etiquette is expected.</h2>

<p>Remember, the subway is both cramped and responsible for accommodating a lot of people. So the best you can do is make the ride easier for yourself and those traveling next to you. Here are some basic subway etiquettes that we think every passenger must adhere to:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Stand to the side to let people off the trains</li><li>Avoid filling seats around you with your stuff or your smelly sense of entitlement</li><li>Walk all the way into the train instead of stopping six inches after walking through the doors.</li><li>No one likes that person who chooses to play their music on loud or to have a conversation on speaker. Sure, it makes for entertainment, but not at 7 am. </li><li>If you find yourself standing against the doors on a train that&#8217;s filled:<ul><li>Give space to those moving in and out when the doors are open.</li><li>If there&#8217;s space, move to the middle of the train.It&#8217;s as easy as that!</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to understand that just because you&#8217;re adhering to these rules, everyone else will too. The truth, as many exhausted New Yorkers will tell you, <strong>the subway has no rules beyond the New York City Criminal Code.</strong> But a little spatial awareness never hurt anyone.?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get a bike if nothing else works.</h2>



<p>Before you take us up on this, we&#8217;d like to say that <em>everything</em> is a little dangerous to a certain degree. There are even some coyotes running around like they own the place!</p>



<p>So <em>be careful</em> but don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that riding a bike is &#8220;too dangerous&#8221;. (Especially since the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjMnKLP9fPtAhU67HMBHT0xCZUQFjABegQIDhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F07%2F03%2Fnyregion%2Fcoronavirus-nyc-bike-paths.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw1saoQ3xoeIJr4HGsRn9wdS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">city continues to adopt a more bike-friendly infrastructur</a>e across the five boroughs!)</p>

<p>Commuting NYC, like a pro, is no big deal. Truly. Sure it seems intimidating at first, given the sheer vastness of the city. But don&#8217;t worry, We&#8217;ve got a guide on NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains to help you hop around the city in no time!</p>



<p>Any form of travel in New York has its own set of hitches. Our traffic is truly among the worst in the world. And it really isn&#8217;t getting better anytime soon.</p>



<p>Those who appreciate sanity often end up resorting to the mass transit in NYC, specifically, the subways and the busses.</p>



<p>Sure, pieces of the former may be falling from the ceiling, and speeds for the latter may be slowing. But if there&#8217;s anything NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains has going for itself is that it&#8217;s cheap, open 24/7, and covers all five boroughs. Yep, Staten Island included.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a visitor or not, you may want some advice on NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains. And we&#8217;re here to provide! Keep reading!</p>

<p>The first thing anyone will tell you about the subway is to plan ahead. Subway delays are a part of the New Yorker&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>All we want to let you know about this is &#8211; never trust anything Google Maps tells you about your ETA. Leave early, always. 15 mins, an hour? Whatever makes you comfortable to get somewhere, if reaching on time is key. Reaching early is always better than getting stuck on the subway — everyone dreads making that excuse.</p>

<p>In the year 2018, the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.mta.mymta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MTA finally released their app</a> — this app is meant to cover NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains, bus, and commuter rail services. You don&#8217;t just save your frequent trips and look for subway stops and bus stations near you. You also get updates on service and delays, and find an array of helpful maps for trains and busses!</p>



<p>Another alternative to this app is <a href="https://transitapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transit</a> — if at all your MTA beta app lags or is too chunky.</p>



<p>You might also need another <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mta.mobileapp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e-Tix app</a> to purchase tickets virtually for the Long Island Rail Road. The MTA&#8217;s contactless payment system, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://omny.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OMNY</a>, doesn&#8217;t have its own app yet, but, you can use your digital wallet on your smartphone to very conveniently tap and go.</p>

<p>This one depends completely on your daily route. You might find that you&#8217;re more comfortable with an unlimited MetroCard, which comes in two variants:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>A 30-day MetroCard for $127</li><li>A 7-day for $33</li></ol>



<p>But before you decide on a solid option, give yourself time to understand what exactly your subway needs are like. You might just find that certain routes are easier if walked or biked!</p>



<p>You just might find that you can walk or bike everywhere (especially since a one-year Citi Bike membership is just $169). In this case, buy an occasional $40 MetroCard, or get a 7-day card if you’re entertaining a visitor who you’ll be riding around with all week.</p>



<p>If you do decide to get an unlimited card, make sure to swipe it forward. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/can-i-get-swipe-can-we-get-trouble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More on this very curious subject here.</a></p>

<p>Imagine running to NYC&#8217;s Subway Trains when you know you&#8217;re late, hearing it pull in as you&#8217;re swiping your card. And then realizing you don&#8217;t have any remaining balance on your MetroCard. It&#8217;ll always work in your favor to pay attention to how much is left <em>when you&#8217;re swiping in.</em></p>



<p>The moment you&#8217;re under $2.75, just fill the card up again at the station when you exit. This will help you avoid finding yourself stuck behind a family of tourists. And then watch them trying to figure out the MetroCard system, as the train arrival time teases you into panic mode. ?</p>
