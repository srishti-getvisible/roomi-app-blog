<p>The residential architecture in Knoxville is like a timeline of the city&#8217;s development over two centuries.

<p>When looking for cheap rooms for rent in Knoxville, you should know that the division of Knoxville branches into the Downtown area and sections based on the four cardinal directions: North Knoxville, South Knoxville, East Knoxville, and West Knoxville.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Walkability &amp; cycling</strong></h3>



<p>Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/8iiu7g/is_knoxville_walkablebikeable/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">sir_culo</a>, a resident of Knoxville says</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Knoxville is great, but outside downtown, it&#8217;s not very walkable or bikeable compared to other cities. Many streets don&#8217;t even have shoulders to walk on, making it impossible to walk. If you live near one of the greenways (like in Bearden) then it&#8217;s easier to get downtown.</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Public transport</strong></h3>



<p>The Knoxville Area Transit, aka, KAT operates over 80 buses, road trolleys, and paratransit vehicles. You&#8217;ll find commercial, as well as recreational shipping (such as john boats, fishing boats and yachts) on the Tennessee river barge terminals in Knoxville.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Traffic</strong></h3>



<p>Alcoa highway connecting the Downton area with McGhee Tyson airport and Maryville is known as Knoxville&#8217;s busiest road. So be prepared to lose some time to traffic when you&#8217;re looking for rooms for rent in Knoxville</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cultural activities in Knoxville</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://www.dogwoodarts.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogwood Arts Festival</a></strong></h3>



<p>Dogwood trails began as a civic beautification project led by the citizens of Knoxville in response to a New York newspaper reporter calling it &#8216;the ugliest city in America.&#8217; Additionally, that led to the Dogwood arts festival celebrating art in Knoxville through yearly events. It&#8217;s free to attend, and you can volunteer at the event too!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://www.rosecenter.org/mountain-makins">Mountain Makins</a></strong></h3>



<p>Mountain Makins started in 1976 and is an annual festival that helped raise funds to save historic Rose School, and still does. Moreover, the festival provides arts education for residents of 5 counties, and serves to keep Appalachian history and culture alive and vibrant.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="http://www.ramseyhouse.org/calendar-2/" class="broken_link">Ramsey House Country Market</a></strong></h3>



<p>An annual event, the fall country market has been a tradition in Knoxville for more than four decades. Additionally, it hosts fair booths with antiques, crafts, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/6-common-houseplants-with-the-most-gorgeous-blooms/">plants</a>, folk art, tours, and workshops.</p>
