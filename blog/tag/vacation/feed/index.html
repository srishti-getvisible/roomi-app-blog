										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So you&#8217;ve moved to a new place, or maybe you&#8217;re a first-time renter. And you&#8217;re flushed with the excitement that comes with it. But then your parents start to tell you to stay safe from robberies. Or maybe you&#8217;re watching the news too much. And right when you reach work, or going on vacation, you start thinking about whether you remembered to shut the windows! Whatever your concern, in this day and age, when we have so many valuables inside our homes, from our laptops and cameras to God knows what else you call &#8216;my precious,&#8217; it&#8217;s understandable to be researching well, on how to secure an apartment with a proper apartment security system in place. So here&#8217;s your guide to home security tips and investing in an apartment security camera as a renter.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recce your location before you move in</h2>



<p>Now if you have some shortlisted options to move into, make sure you put in the research to know more about your potential neighborhood! Here&#8217;s one of the most basic home security tips. Check the streetlights around and see whether they&#8217;re functional.</p>



<p>Then check for entrances, exits, doors and windows to see whether they look safe enough. Take a walk around the neighborhood at different times during the day to ensure you&#8217;ll feel comfortable living there. Then you can plan better for your apartment security system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">After you move in, get renter&#8217;s insurance</h2>



<p>Now maybe you&#8217;ve moved into a new place, or maybe you&#8217;re thinking of an apartment security system for your current dwelling. But no matter your situation, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/4-reasons-to-get-renters-insurance-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">renter&#8217;s insurance</a> can be a very handy investment and one of the best home security tips, in case of loss of property. (You don&#8217;t want it to happen, and neither do we. But like they say, better to be safe than sorry!)</p>



<p>Additionally, your landlord&#8217;s homeowner insurance will only protect the property, and not your personal belongings. So go get that renters insurance, and then move on to investing in the right apartment security system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Consider installing a security camera</h2>



<p>First off, check your rental agreement for clauses regarding an apartment security camera, and whether you can install one as a renter. Then take action accordingly. This can be one of the more rudimentary home security tips if you invest a basic amount towards it.</p>



<p>If you can, try and go for more sophisticated options for an apartment security camera (think <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.safewise.com/blog/best-wireless-security-cameras/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">WiFi-connected</a> devices that need less hardware and will cause lesser issues with the landlord.) Also, make sure the apartment security camera isn&#8217;t pointing at your neighbor&#8217;s door or window! Only point it towards your own home entry and of course, take permission from everyone involved.</p>



<p>You could also try video doorbells, that allow you to talk through the door when someone comes, so you know who it is for sure. They can cost you up to $200 for both, and it&#8217;s a good one time investment to have.</p>



<p>Or you could go for a complete <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://in.pcmag.com/surveillance-cameras/99815/the-best-smart-home-security-systems-for-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">apartment security system</a> that can cost you about $100-200 per month.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Upgrade your door and window locks</h2>



<p>Now this one&#8217;s a must when you move into a new place. If you&#8217;re not getting a sophisticated home security system, that&#8217;s fine! But do remember to get your locks upgraded. Sounds pretty basic, right? But most of us don&#8217;t bother about these home security tips much when we think about an apartment security system.</p>



<p>You could ask your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/can-landlord-lock-legally/">landlord to change the locks</a> so you know that no one else (previous tenants, and even previous robbers) have an extra set of keys. And then you can ask them if you can install extra door locks for additional protection from intruders. (At your own cost, of course.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make friends with your roommates and neighbors</h2>



<p>Now this apartment security system might work both ways. (If your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-to-do-roommate-stealing/">roommate</a> or a neighbor turns out to be a thief themselves, that is.) But it makes sense to make friends with trusted roommates and neighbors to stay protected and take care of each other.</p>



<p>This can even help when you&#8217;re going on vacation, or even heading home for a few days. This way, you&#8217;ll know there&#8217;s someone to water your plants, and just to keep an eye out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don&#8217;t be too predictable</h2>



<p>If you have valuable stuff that you don&#8217;t want stolen when you&#8217;re going on vacation or just heading home, make sure you don&#8217;t leave them lying around. Additionally, as a DIY apartment security system, here&#8217;s something you could do: avoid hiding valuables in places everyone would know to check.</p>



<p>Instead, hide them in unusual places or in disguised locations (think a new dustbin placed in a bathroom) or better yet, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suck-UK-Hideaway-Succulent-Ceramic/dp/B07QRYW48Q/ref=sr_1_17?dchild=1&amp;keywords=secret+compartment+items&amp;qid=1619685515&amp;sr=8-17">faux potted plant</a>. Alternatively, you could invest in a safe that keeps your stuff&#8230; well, safe.</p>



<p>Well, there you have it. Be smart and stay safe with a good apartment security system in place!</p>

<p>Long vacation or not, living in NYC can be quite affordable. All you need to be is a little nifty and a little creative. Here&#8217;s a small guide to afford to live in NYC when traveling for over a week!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-york-travel-guide-rule-1-know-your-travel-priorities">New York Travel Guide Rule 1: Know your travel priorities.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Your reasons for traveling to New York could be any. And whatever the reason, we recommend listing down your top priorities for your visit. You might want to skip on the hotel expenses and try subletting for the duration of your stay. Or find cheaper alternatives on sites like Airbnb.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-york-travel-guide-rule-2-public-transport-and-your-walking-shoes">New York Travel Guide Rule 2: Public transport and your walking shoes.</h3>



<p>As a rule, do not let your rent exceed 30% of your overall budget. That&#8217;s a good place to start. Then, maybe pick a place close to the subway, or at a walkable distance from the places you definitely do not want to miss out on. Public transit will be your best friend, after those walking shoes of yours, of course. Maybe even rent a bike! Oh, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-york-travel-guide-rule-3-do-not-forget-to-keep-a-record-of-your-expenses">New York Travel Guide Rule 3: Do not forget to keep a record of your expenses.</h3>



<p>It can be quite hard to keep up with your expenses, especially on vacation. But, the great thing about New York is the endless amount of choice it comes with. The trick is to take charge. Record what you spend weekly, then monthly. Daily coffees stack up quickly. So do water bottles at newsstands.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-york-travel-guide-rule-4-if-it-s-a-long-vacation-enjoy-the-days-you-spend-less-as-well-as-the-days-you-spend-more">New York Travel Guide Rule 4: If it&#8217;s a long vacation, enjoy the days you spend less as well as the days you spend more.</h3>



<p>The good thing about a long vacation in New York is that you can take some days to just relax, take a walk around the neighborhood you&#8217;re in, and let the day take its course. Not every one of your days needs to end with a fancy bottle of wine. Sometimes cheap take-out and some beer, against the sound of the streets of New York over dinner will do the trick just as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-and-now-for-the-daytime-treats-for-when-you-re-on-a-long-vacation-in-new-york-city">And now for the daytime treats for when you&#8217;re on a long vacation in New York City!</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>Before we begin, it&#8217;s important to mention that this is by no means a &#8220;top things to do on vacation in NYC&#8221; list. These are some of our favorite spots around the city that are often missed by tourists, especially those who don&#8217;t have a lot of time on their hands.</p>



<p>P.S.: When you&#8217;re on vacation, you mustn&#8217;t let yourself get embarrassed about all the touristy things you wish to do. Once you know what your vacation budget is, there shouldn&#8217;t be anything stopping you from having the best time possible!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-big-bus-tours"><a href="https://www.bigbustours.com/en/new-york/new-york-bus-tours/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Bus Tours</a></h3>



<p>The routes offered on Big Bus New York include: Uptown, Downtown, Harlem and Brooklyn routes, each ranging from 1 hour to 1.5 hours in duration, which run approximately every couple of hours. On a bright morning, get yourself a bagel and a coffee and get on a big bus!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-harlem-gospel-walking-tour"><a href="https://www.harlemheritage.com/harlem-walking-tours/harlem-gospel-walking-tour/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harlem Gospel walking tour!</a></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.harlemheritage.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harlem Heritage Tours</a> offers a range of walking tours to help you get acquainted with the area’s incredible history. But a major stand out, that no one should miss, especially when they have time is the Harlem gospel walking tour.</p>



<p>Not all New York travel guides will mention this, but if you get yourself here, what will unfold after is incredible. Prepare yourself for a moving morning, with lessons in African American history and its many contributions to global culture from visiting the Apollo Theatre and former President Bill Clinton’s office to walking the same streets as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr did during the American civil rights movement of the ’50s and ’60s.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-central-park-bike-ride">Central Park bike ride</h3>



<p>Take it from us, there&#8217;s no better way to enjoy the crisp Autumn air any other way but by riding around Central Park. You can <a href="https://bikerentalcentralpark.com/tours?location=central_park" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">sign up for a guided tour</a> to ensure you don’t miss the park’s hidden treasures like the Olmsted-designed waterfall!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-beacon-s-closet"><a href="https://beaconscloset.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beacon&#8217;s Closet</a></h3>



<p>Vintage may or may not be your style, but a visit to Beacon&#8217;s Closet is completely worth your time. The store runs on a &#8216;buy, sell, trade&#8217; model and has completely embraced sustainable and ethical business practices.</p>

<p>Come in for the New York Toasting Bagels, stay for the story of this legendary NYC hit! In 1934 Louis and Lillian Zabar opened up shop, introducing New Yorkers to quality delicacies like smoked fish, caviar, gnocchi, brie and sun-dried tomatoes. This is a big &#8216;don&#8217;t miss!&#8217;</p>

<p>By now, you&#8217;re probably a week into your vacation and in strong need of some downtime after all those days of living in NYC. For the ultimate morning relaxation, head to AIRE Ancient Baths.

<p>There&#8217;s no competing with the grace of New York City Ballet, especially when you see them on their home turf. Experts recommend that you’re a beginner, opt for a showcase performance such as the NYCB Classics to help you get acquainted with the work of Balanchine while also seeing contemporary styles coming from choreographers such as Pam Tanowitz and Justin Peck.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joe-s-shanghai-chinatown"><a href="https://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com/englishmenu.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Joe&#8217;s Shanghai, Chinatown!</a></h3>



<p>Classic soup dumplings, wontons, and pork pancakes. Chinatown in New York City doesn&#8217;t get any better than that. And you really don&#8217;t need a New York travel guide to tell you that.</p>



<p>The first Joe’s Shanghai was founded in Flushing, Queens NY in 1994 and their famous soup dumplings soon became the talk of NYC. A mecca for every authentic Chinese food enthusiast, this is a must-visit, take our word for it. If you&#8217;re living in NYC, even for the shortest while, drop by here.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prince-street-pizza"><a href="https://princestreetpizzanyc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Street Pizza</a></h3>



<p>This is quite frankly, a New York City institution. According to many NYC folks, this is probably the only place to try a classic NYC square slice.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all Prince Street has to offer! Window-shop Prince Street’s many boutiques — think antique stores, perfumeries, bespoke jewellery stores, and beauty boutiques — before refuelling with a classic NYC slice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dinner-at-hell-s-kitchen">Dinner at Hell&#8217;s Kitchen</h3>



<p>This section of this blog has naturally turned into a food recommendations&#8217; list and we know no one&#8217;s complaining. Hell&#8217;s Kitchen is one of Manhattan’s most bustling foodie destinations. This is the area where many first-time restaurateurs try out new ideas, so there’s something for all palates. Bolivian, Uighur, American, Italian, Peruvian, Haitian, Venezuelan, Mexican, Japanese, Uzbek, Afghan, Thai and Cuban are all on offer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dizzy-s-club-and-milton-s-playhouse"><a href="https://www.jazz.org/dizzys/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Dizzy&#8217;s Club</a> and <a href="http://mintonsharlem.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milton&#8217;s Playhouse</a></h3>



<p>No one recommends missing on some of the world&#8217;s best jazz during your visit to NYC. Dizzy’s Club is the Lincoln Centre’s intimate jazz club, also home to southern-inspired American food and craft cocktails. If you’re up for it, make sure you attend one of the club’s Late Night Sessions, or for the adventurous among us, a Late Night Dance Session!</p>

<p>Want more jazz? Milton&#8217;s Playhouse in Harlem is a shrine to the history of Jazz. It is one of NYC’s most revered live music venues. It was established in 1938 by saxophonist Henry Minton and is much-adored around the world for being the first official home of Bebop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We&#8217;re still dreaming of taking our masks off in the wild. All while looking forward to a world with no restrictions, so we can realize our greatest travel dreams.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s taking a tad bit longer than we&#8217;d like, yes?</p>



<p>So what can we do right now to work on our travel dreams? Apart from vicariously <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/6-travel-books-for-your-wandering-soul-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">traveling through the books written by envied wanderers</a>?</p>



<p>You could <strong>SAVE FOR YOUR NEXT TRIP</strong>!</p>



<p>And make sure there&#8217;s nothing stopping you from traveling to your heart&#8217;s content when we finally triumph over the disease.</p>



<p>Whether you plan to free solo or do it with your friends or fam, you need to start making your individual budget to go execute your wildest travel dreams.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/managing-personal-finance-by-sticking-to-your-budget-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get our budgeting hats out</a>, and keep our world map ready to start building our travel funds!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-choose-your-vacation-destination">1. Choose your vacation destination</h2>



<p>We all want to go around the world in 80 days, but unfortunately, we&#8217;d need tons of money to do that. And anyway, what&#8217;s the fun if you can&#8217;t take your time to fully experience each place you travel to, like a true local?</p>



<p>So when you dream of your next vacation, start by choosing a place, and then save accordingly.</p>



<p>Depending on whether it&#8217;s within the country or abroad, take a world map and mark the place you want to visit with a big diagrammatic heart. Or whatever you fancy!</p>



<p>This will keep you focused on your goal (especially when you&#8217;re <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-comedy-movies-to-watch-when-you-hate-your-job-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working from home for a job you hate</a>.)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-how-much-will-it-cost">2. How much will it cost?</h2>



<p>Now that you have the place in mind, do your research. How much is the flight going to cost?</p>



<p>Next step: research about cost of living, food, etc, along with hunting for the best travel deals.</p>



<p>Even though the rates might be affected by the pandemic right now, you can always head to blogs and resources of the pandemic past, to put an estimated cost against your dream vacation. To further optimize your travel budget, consider the advantages of <a href="https://www.weareplanet.com/blog/tax-free-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tax-free shopping for tourists</a>. This can greatly reduce the cost of souvenirs and other purchases you make abroad, allowing you to allocate more of your funds towards experiencing local culture and attractions.</p>



<p>However, you don&#8217;t have to fix the exact budget now. This is just to know how much you would approximately need.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-how-far-can-you-cheap-out">3. How far can you cheap out?</h2>



<p>Now there are two types of wanderers, so you have got to pick your squad.</p>



<p>One is the tribe of luxury lovers, influenced by influencers, doing it for the &#8216;gram. If you relate to this, you&#8217;d want to visit one destination that you can think about for the rest of the year &#8211; with #tbt filling your social media handles.</p>



<p>And the other is the type of people who would do anything to make it as cheap as they can, so they can move around like nomads till their feet are tired, and their hearts satiated.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve picked the tribe you relate to, plan your budget accordingly.</p>



<p>If you relate to the former kind, find yourself travel deals that will help you travel luxuriously without going broke.</p>



<p>And if you&#8217;re the latter kind, head on to travel forums to figure out the possible frugality of cheap travel &#8211; think travel deals, couch surfing, au pair, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-netflix-and-chill-or-travel-and-thrill">4. Netflix and chill or travel and thrill?</h2>



<p>Another <em>&#8216;choose what kind of person you are&#8217;</em> game, think about how much you spend on subscriptions like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.</p>



<p>Now think about how much that would add to your travel fund? It&#8217;s simply a matter of choices!</p>



<p>While not cutting down drastically, all you have to do is let go of your subscriptions. You will still have Youtube, and netizens can surely hack their way around the internet when it comes to entertainment.</p>



<p>You could also <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-ways-to-ask-parents-for-money-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ask your friends and family</a> for their passwords when you really NEED to watch something!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-earn-more-money-for-your-vacation-fund">5. Earn more money for your vacation fund</h2>



<p>&#8230; And put it all into your travel fund.</p>



<p>In this work from the home era, there might be plenty of online jobs (stay aware of scams though) and earn a little bit on the side.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t worry about giving more of your free time to work. Think about the bigger picture and it&#8217;ll all be worth it!</p>



<p>Good luck and happy travel dreams to ya!</p>

Dining, nightlife, outdoor fun, concerts, sporting events, it’s got it all. But without the congested traffic, panicked schedules, and impossible-to-find parking of the Big Apple. The Adirondack Park is just to the north so you can find your ideal mix of outdoorsy stuff and city life entertainment when you find houses in NYC for rent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you really want to do a 180 on city living for the weekend, it’s tough to beat the accessible and amazing <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://visitadirondacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adirondack Park</a>.

<p>Additionally, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">here’s plenty of relaxing things to do that don’t require you to lug around a fifty-pound pack. Maybe you feel like you lug around enough baggage at the airport and the idea of doing that on vacation strikes you as crazy talk. Adirondack Park is covered in scenic drives so you can enjoy nature’s beauty while jamming out to your tunes and reveling in the novelty of an open road. A welcome break from city traffic since</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://abc7ny.com/traffic/9-of-the-nations-worst-bottlenecks-are-right-here/1095908/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">9 of the nation’s worst bottlenecks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are located around New York City.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Houses for rent in NYC: Niagara Falls State Park</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No discussion about places to travel in the state of New York would be complete without giving the nod to the venerable <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.niagarafallsstatepark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niagara Falls</a>. At night, the falls are illuminated with colored lights creating a dazzling, almost other-worldly display of unparalleled beauty. If you’re feeling adventurous and want a closer look, you could try the Cave of the Winds tour. But expect to get wet and keep your poncho as a souvenir.</span></p>
