<p>Roommate etiquette forms as a base to healthy relationship boundaries while co living. Whether you grew up sharing a room with your siblings or you&#8217;re an only child with a bedroom all to yourself, living with someone new can be challenging. As exciting as it is to move into a new apartment and forge new friendships with your roomies, it is equally important to know where to draw the line and maintain some privacy.</p>



<p>Here are some steps you can take to make sure that co living with your roomie is a fabulous experience that you can cherish for a lifetime.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roommate etiquette 101: <strong>Establish Boundaries</strong></h2>



<p>Most people have trouble co living with others because the people they are living with lack any sense of boundaries. Setting healthy relationship boundaries with your roomies is the best way to make sure that you can maintain a pleasant and non-hostile atmosphere. Communicate with them early on regarding how you want to live, what your boundaries are and especially what your pet peeves are. </p>



<p>While everyone has to adjust and compromise when co living with other people, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you need to live in an environment where you don’t feel comfortable. Communicate!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Respect personal space</strong></h2>



<p>Once healthy relationship boundaries have been established, make sure you respect them! Don’t go barging in on your roomie if they&#8217;ve made it clear that they want to be left alone. Similarly, don’t put up with it if someone else is invading your personal space. Make sure you respect their time, space and boundaries &#8211; and that they respect yours. This is the secret of successful co living!</p>



<p>If your roomie does something you don’t like, speak up! At the same time, if your roomie tells you that you overstepped the line, don’t take offence. These things are bound to happen in the beginning, just apologize and do better next time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lay down ground rules</strong></h2>



<p>Setting some ground rules are a part of roommate etiquette and healthy relationship boundaries. They can co living a 100 times easier to navigate and a lot more comfortable. </p>



<p>Don’t want loud music disturbing you when you’re trying to go to sleep? Set quiet hours when no one can be loud and disturb others. Hate seeing dirty dishes in the sink for days on end? Create a schedule and <em>reasonable</em> time frame within which all the chores should be done. Do not want an endless parade of guests going in and out of the house? Set up a rule with your roomies on how many guests are allowed in your home, especially if someone wants to throw a party.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have some &#8216;me&#8217; time while co living</strong></h2>



<p>Now that you&#8217;re living with others, it&#8217;s even more important to set some time aside when you can be alone. Even though it does not come under roommate etiquette as such, but is still important at an individual level. </p>



<p>Having some ‘me’ time, while co living is essential for your mental health and well being. You can go for a run, read a book, watch movies, bake, get (or give yourself!) mani-pedis&#8230; the list is endless! The point is to do what relaxes you and makes you feel rejuvenated. Just make sure you tell your roomies when your ‘me’ time is, so that they don&#8217;t disturb you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Create your own safe haven</strong></h2>



<p>When you are co living with someone else, there are not a lot of places you can go within the house to be alone. Roommate etiquette includes feeling comfortable in your space. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to have a designated spot that acts as your safe haven in the midst of communal living.</p>



<p>If you have your own room, creating your haven is a lot easier, but if you don&#8217;t, no worries! Just pick a corner and turn it into your safe space! This can be a study table or a gaming corner, the choice is yours. This is one of the most fun parts of living on your “own”, you get to create and decorate your own space!</p>

<p>While it’s true that sharing resources and supplies is inevitable to a certain extent when you&#8217;re co living, don&#8217;t depend on your roomies for all your supplies. This could possibly be one of the quickest ways to sour your healthy relationship boundaries with them!</p>



<p>Instead, you should take care of your own supplies and take note if you&#8217;re running out. Have a weekly/monthly schedule for shopping for essentials such as groceries, medicine, and household supplies. Make sure you and your roomies are on the same page about which supplies are communal and which are personal so none of you impose on the others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After many mindless hours of scrolling through endless social media posts every night, you might’ve developed the habit of shutting your laptop and leaving it casually on the coffee table. Do you think twice about locking it? Maybe not. Because some house rules are so common sense, you assume that even the worst roommate isn&#8217;t going to invade your privacy by snooping around. And most of us are lucky enough to never have this turn into an issue. But it can’t hurt to practice extra caution. Because in our world, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/safe-online-banking-tips-for-the-beginner/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bank accounts</a>, credit cards, and other private information are too readily available online. Thankfully, electronic devices are built with your security in mind. So even if you’re not necessarily worried about your roommate snooping around. And even if they aren&#8217;t bad roommates, there are a few simple security measures you should always take to protect your private info.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. General tips to protect your info from bad roommates who like to snoop around</h2>



<p>Let’s get some basics out of the way before we dive in. There are varying levels of security, depending on your (potential) problem. When you’re co-living, you should treat your devices the same as you would a public computer. When you log into Facebook on a library computer, you probably remember to log out of the site and the system, right? Because you don’t want a stranger posting something like “My mother is a hamster, and my father smells of elderberries,” on your page — among other strange, potentially obscene things. So do the same thing at home! Log out, or set your laptop/phone/tablet to lock after a few minutes of being inactive. This is a must, irrespective of whether you have bad roommates or good ones.</p>



<p>Charlie Cohn, Head of Marketing at college learning marketplace&nbsp;<a href="https://studysoup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">StudySoup</a>, points out that in some cases, the device you want to protect might not be yours alone. And for that, there’s a pretty simple solution.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“If you share a computer with a roommate or housemate, set up a different user profile for each person that uses the device,” Cohn says. “If it will prevent you from being able to easily open each others’ files or access websites where you are logged in.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Make sure if you have bad roommates who want to poke around, they encounter a password. Which brings us to our next point. Passwords! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Passwords</h2>



<p>Get a password. Better yet, get several passwords. Do you have the same password with different variations for each and every account you have on your devices and online? It’s not uncommon. But it’s very risky. Especially if you run across a phishing site that wrangles the information out of you. And can tell your friends about your hamster of a mother. And drain your bank account faster than you can type “OMG.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“It’s best to use complex and unique passwords so that one compromised password doesn’t allow someone to access all of your files,” says Randy Downs, an IT expert and owner of <a href="http://downsconsultingservices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downs Consulting Services.</a></p><p>“It does little good to password-protect your data if you leave the code lying around. Likewise, it’s not useful to have passwords that can be easily guessed, like your pet’s name or simply ‘password’.”</p></blockquote>



<p>So get several passwords, and make them complicated so your bad roommates are locked out of your personal stuff. The more important the device/site, the more complicated the password. Example: A good Neopets password (remember those things?) would be the name of your cat. A good bank account password would be something like N7P0Q1B8$A12L!. Luckily you don’t have to come up with something that crazy on your own.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What if your bad roommates are ultra tech savvy? </h3>



<p>Now let’s say the worst roommate is digging around. And they also happen to be an expert in the field of technology. You’re going to need some extra lock-down, and encryption is the way to go. Encryption is basically a password for your password to keep your bad roommates out of your digital stuff. When something has been encrypted, it garbles the data around into an unreadable mess. And the only way to translate (decrypt) it is to know the password.</p>



<p>Again, you need a good password, especially for these services. While this may sound complicated, it’s simply a matter of taking an extra step to know you’re extra secure.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Encryption is the way to go! </h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Encrypting devices such as iPhones can be as easy as going into Settings, enabling a strong passcode (i.e., six digits or more) and enabling data protection. Be very careful that you have the passcode written down somewhere safe as you can find yourself locked out as well. A six-digit passcode can take up to five years to guess if all combinations are used,” says Downs.</p></blockquote>



<p>Nicholas Larsen, a <a href="http://studentsuccess.uams.edu/2015/10/the-art-of-google-5-tips-to-enhance-your-search-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology support expert</a> at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, recommends that when you’re trying to encrypt your laptops and computers, you should look into the encryption services already provided on your operating system.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Windows offers <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/bitlocker-drive-encryption-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitLocker</a> for some users, and Macs inherently have FileVault — you just have to enable it,” he says.</p></blockquote>



<p>Randy Downs points out that commonly used email services like Gmail and Yahoo already use encryption. As do most WiFi routers. But it doesn’t hurt to verify.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“You should have WPA2 encryption on with a strong password and WPS off,” advises Downs.</p></blockquote>



<p>Finally, make sure your Cloud Data is protected as well; a strong password is again the key to keep your bad roommates out.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Even better, use cloud encryption like CloudFogger, which encrypts the data on your computer and decrypts as needed,” Downs says.</p></blockquote>



<p>To make a long story short, practicing good security methods at home doesn’t hurt, and it’s pretty simple. Whether it’s your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-my-roommate-is-driving-me-up-the-wall-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snooping roommate</a>, the stranger that found your phone on a city street, or the adept hacker that took your Twitter account and sent all those weird messages to your ex, a good password could make a world of difference.</p>
