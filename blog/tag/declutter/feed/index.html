<p>Clutter. A pretty-looking word, but not a pretty sight. Sometimes in life, we all come face to face with it. When we&#8217;re too lazy to keep things neat and tidy, or when we&#8217;re moving apartments. Or if we&#8217;re simply messy by nature. In this article, we&#8217;re going to talk about how to declutter your home, and whether it&#8217;s even meant for you. If it is, then you&#8217;ll find some helpful tips on how to declutter your apartment with the help of Dana White&#8217;s book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35540769-decluttering-at-the-speed-of-life" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decluttering at the speed of life</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">To each their own when it comes to being messy</h2>



<p>Before going in, we want to talk subjectively about clutter in the apartment. On one hand, there&#8217;s ongoing research that suggests messy people are more creative. As psychologist <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/opinion/sunday/its-not-mess-its-creativity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Kathleen Vohs tells the New York Times</a>, <strong><em>&#8220;being around messiness would lead people away from convention, in favor of new directions.&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.mic.com/p/are-messy-people-really-more-creative-21783421" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nancy Irwin, another psychologist talks to Mic</a>, <strong><em>“If one truly believes their creativity comes from clutter, then they may only feel creative in their messy environment. This is the placebo effect, and mess has no real neurological benefit on creativity in and of itself.”</em></strong></p>



<p>In conclusion, this argument is &#8230; a mess in itself too.</p>



<p>Which is why, we want to tell you that it&#8217;s your life, and your space. So do whatever makes you feel at home, in your home!</p>



<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got that off of our chest, let&#8217;s see some ways to declutter your home in the best way possible, even if it&#8217;s in a messy way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is clutter to you?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>I define clutter as anything I can’t keep under control. If a space in my home consistently gets out of control, I have too much stuff in that space. I have clutter. </p><cite>Dana White</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>What do you define as clutter then? Is it just a messy way to keep all the things that are of use to you? And how does it make you feel? If you do feel overwhelmed every time you look at that particular space. Or if you don&#8217;t use anything from the messy pile of clutter on your table, then it&#8217;s surely time to declutter your apartment.</p>



<p>But on the other hand, if the mess is something you like to look at, or if the chaos drives your creativity, and you use things from the mess almost every day, then you don&#8217;t really need to declutter your home. It&#8217;s all a matter of what you want to live with, and what you just can&#8217;t.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do you have space for the clutter or do you NEED to declutter your home?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Accept the limitations of the space you have, and declutter enough that your stuff fits comfortably in that space. </p><cite>Dana White</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>What makes messy living extremely overwhelming is if you have a small space that hosts clutter like uninvited guests. So as Dana White says in Decluttering at the speed of life, you need to accept the limitations of your space. Even if you like a messy environment, make sure it doesn&#8217;t completely block your open spaces around the room. And if it does, it&#8217;s time to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/apps-to-sell-used-goods-online-and-declutter-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">declutter your home</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hoarding isn&#8217;t organizing</h2>



<p>We know, this one stings. But it&#8217;s the truth. And we all struggle with it when we sit to declutter our home. Some things are too pretty to throw away and we understand. But the problem is, keep one pretty thing, and soon it becomes boxes and boxes of things that you don&#8217;t know what to do with when you sit to declutter your apartment. However, you still <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/is-your-roommate-a-slob-or-a-hoarder-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">want to hoard</a> things, in hopes for an idea to come knocking on the box&#8217;s door.</p>



<p>But as Dana White says in Decluttering at the speed of life:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Keep Boxes don’t work. They let me put off making a final decision. I can temporarily place a particularly difficult item inside, confident that the future version of me will know what to do with it. Future Me doesn’t deserve that much credit, and honestly, she doesn’t appreciate the pressure. </p><cite>Dana White</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>So do your future self a favor, sing along with Elsa, and LET IT GO, LET IT GOOOOO to declutter your home!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep the interesting stuff going when you declutter your home</h2>



<p>If your clutter is made up of interesting things that add value to your life in any way, keep them. What you need to know is the distinction between what you compulsively hoard, and the stuff that actually makes you happy when you declutter your apartment.</p>



<p>Because as Dana White says in Decluttering at the speed of life</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>A common trait among people who struggle with clutter: they’re interesting, and they like interesting stuff.</p><cite>Dana White</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>So to declutter your home in the best way possible, find a healthy balance, like in every other aspect of life, and you have nothing to worry about. Most importantly, do whatever makes you feel comfortable and free in your space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Have you been sitting at home staring at your blank wall, wondering what happened to your personal decor style? 2020 had most of us shut inside the same four walls for longer than we had ever imagined. Therefore, it does not come as a surprise that many of us are scavenging the internet for ways to declutter and revamp our shrines with new home decor ideas. And since the roaring 20s are back in style (along with economic depression), Roomi has a list of cheap home decor stores to save the day (and your pocket).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Home decor ideas for when you no longer have ideas</strong></h2>



<p>According to home and lifestyle magazine <a href="https://www.livspace.com/in/magazine/interior-design-trends-2021" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Livespace</a>, “illuminating yellow” and Ultimate gray are the <a href="https://www.pantone.com/hk/en/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pantone</a> colors of this year. In addition, lighter woods and materials like hemp and natural fabrics are in vogue, giving us that extra connection to nature right inside our homes.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you consider yourself a collector of stuff (even though your roomis might prefer to just call it trash), you&#8217;re probably not concerned about the insects or spiders living within, and you&#8217;ve even started calling them your <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spiderbro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">spider-bros.</a> But what you do have is &#8211; disposophobia! Or in simpler terms, your roomis, friends, and family members call you a hoarder. The thing is, you no longer need to spend your days wondering how to declutter. If you are willing to accept help, we&#8217;re here to guide you through it. The thing is, you don&#8217;t like being called that. You feel attached to these things (like your ex&#8217;s sweater), or maybe you collect them (like egg cartons, waste paper, etc.) to repurpose and make something out of them on DIY weekends.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let&#8217;s talk about hoarding for a second.</h2>



<p>If you relate to this, you&#8217;ll probably find some consolation in knowing about geniuses who were hardcore hoarders. From <a href="https://vimeo.com/19378813" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s boxes</a> to <a href="https://www.faena.com/aleph/articles/the-adorable-eccentricities-of-composer-erik-satie/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Erik Satie&#8217;s love for umbrellas</a> shows the love of hoarding and the value it offers to the creative process.</p>



<p>More often than not, you continue to hoard because you enjoy it, and it gives you happiness to add another item to your collection now and then. Stamp and coin collectors are often appreciated, even respected. But if you are a collector of egg cartons or fallen twigs and leaves, you become a compulsive hoarder? Life isn&#8217;t fair.</p>



<p>But then one day, you might look at the stuff you hoard and think &#8211; &#8216;Am I EVER going to use that?&#8217; &#8216;Or is it adding even a little value to my life?&#8217; and thought of decluttering might enter your mind.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/i.pinimg.com/originals/24/32/3f/24323f74b4730ee2987ed4a1647d30f3.jpg?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="a meme on what hoarders are like, and how to declutter"/></figure>



<p>One of the facets of compulsive hoarding is that you refuse to declutter and throw the stuff out, but instead, you organize and keep them in neat little labeled boxes, making it even harder to recognize that this might be a problem.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/annoying-habits-to-avoid-when-co-living-with-roomis-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Habits That Put You In The &#8216;Annoying Roommate&#8217; Zone</a></strong></p>



<p>But when that doubt does arise, don&#8217;t ignore it. Get rid of some stuff, slowly but steadily, and make space in your home and life for the things you do need.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Take baby steps to declutter</h2>



<p>When stuff is lying around your house, you can do nothing but take baby steps. So take the metaphorical baby steps to stop being a hoarder. The first of many is: deep clean your apartment and find all the things you like to hoard. Make it fun by inviting your roomis to join in for a hoarder&#8217;s treasure hunt! As and when you find the little treasures, think about the objects that add little or no value to you. Think about which items might be compromising your hygiene and health, and say your final goodbyes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Donate your riches</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re the kind of hoarder that collects useful items like clothes, shoes, books, stationery, etc. but never use it, consider donating your riches. Many people can make use of the stuff you don&#8217;t use. Find organizations that look for donations and get rid of things with zero guilt of throwing stuff away. Once you know they&#8217;re going to the right place and might help people in need, de-cluttering and de-hoarding will become much more comfortable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Find your support group</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to give up your identity as a hoarder but are too emotionally attached to your treasures, ask a roomi, friend, or family member to help. Show them your collection and tell them to get rid of things that they think are completely useless and have never seen you use. We understand that this can be a bit invasive, but if you&#8217;re willing to get help, you will realize that most of the stuff isn&#8217;t as important as you thought.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. What makes you emotionally attached?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re holding onto an object that reminds you of something in your life, think about whether it&#8217;s good times you&#8217;re remembering or an event that you need to let go of. For instance, if you&#8217;re holding on to a grade card or encouraging note from a teacher or a friend, that&#8217;s great, and maybe you can put the best one on display and throw the rest out to declutter. On the other hand, if it&#8217;s an ex&#8217;s t-shirt or airplane tickets from a trip with your ex, you NEED to throw them out. Whether good or bad, that phase of your life is gone. And you need to let go of things that keep you stuck in time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Swamped with work or busy looking for work? We’re all stuck in the same work from home situation RN. A daydream that played on loop before, has now become a dreaded reality. TBH, today work from home has lost its dreamy charm along with the freedom associated with it. The urge to work, seated in a quaint little cafe, amidst the melodious hum of conversations and ambient music, is quickly becoming our newfound dream. However, you shouldn’t strive to visit one given the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in many states. Don&#8217;t be disheartened though we have some home decor tips to bring the cafe vibes home!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips to make your work from home office work for you?</h2>



<p>Step into the land of DIY (Dream It Yourself), then proceed to DO it yourself. </p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Start by adding a spoon full of productivity tips to <mark>work</mark> from <mark>home</mark> effectively. We shall reveal some</li><li>Then make your <mark>home</mark> office pleasantly inviting, by taking inspiration from the cafes you have always loved!  Both of which you will find below. Let&#8217;s get started!</li></ol>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/motivating-yourself-to-work-from-home-in-2021-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Related: 5 Ways To Motivate Yourself To Work From Home In January 2021</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>First things first, get it together</strong>! </h3>



<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since we were first sent to work from home to help flatten the curve, meaning it&#8217;s likely that the pile of clothes on the sofa has been on a steady rise.</p>



<p>Some say that a messy environment is conducive to creative thoughts, but that might not always be the case. When it comes to clearing your head and gaining a fresh perspective, you need to clean that mess! (You could go the <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/pages/about" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marie Kondo way</a> by organizing your home once and never having to do it again if that’s something you want to explore.) We promise this activity will lighten your mood instantly. In fact, this is the first step for anyone looking for tips to work from home productively.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Water your side of the grass</h3>



<p>If the grass seems to be greener on the other side, maybe you just haven&#8217;t been maintaining your side properly. Now could be the perfect time to introduce yourself to the art of gardening.</p>



<p>A therapeutic activity that can really lower your expenses in the long run, you can discover a lot of online resources to grow beautiful and useful indoor plants. Growing your own herb garden will reduce the stress associated with working from home and will help you gain a perspective on growth and renewal in these trying times. Not only will the green<a href="https://www.hoppier.com/blog/office-plants" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> help you with focus &amp; productivity at work</a> it also doubles as easy home decor.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Invest in better gear for your work from home office</h3>



<p>Put retail therapy to better use! While you’re scrolling for things to buy off of the internet, why not buy things that will make your lockdown work life more comfortable? Unpredictable working hours and unsuitable seating, while you work from home, can risk your physical health. Whether it’s buying a pretty work desk and chair for your home office from IKEA, or a rustic looking bookshelf that reminds you of your favorite cafe, it’s best to make that investment and save yourself back troubles in the future. These essential home decor beauties will definitely lighten up your space!  Because let&#8217;s face it &#8211; you don&#8217;t really need another pair of shoes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Try your hand at DIY home decor</h3>



<p>If you’re planning to take some time off of the internet and find inner peace, making your own home decor is one of the best ways to have fun and get creative. You’ll keep your hands busy, making it impossible to stay glued to your screens, and it will help keep your focus on the task at hand. You can find a number of DIY projects that make use of cheap materials. (Think Macrame, crochet, or painting) You can even recycle and re-use stuff you already have but have no use for anymore. You can add these DIYs to your home office to bring &#8217;em cafe vibes home. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use baking aroma to bring cafe vibes to your home office</h3>



<p>Fill your apartment with the sweet fragrance of tea or coffee! If you love baking try to add some cake, biscuits or muffins to the mix for that perfect cafe aroma. Baking has become the activity-of-choice for many of us home dwellers, and we think these are the reasons:</p>



<p>a) Baking can be a great, therapeutic activity to get your mind off of things and enjoy the present moment. Also, a tasty way to take a break from work!</p>



<p>b) No one will know or judge you for eating an entire cake by yourself while you&#8217;re stuck inside!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The great outdoors</h3>



<p>Have an empty outdoor space? Put chairs and a table &#8211; or a mat and some cushions if you prefer to chill out on the floor. This is a quick way to add boho cafe vibes that will pair well with your morning coffee. You could even attach a tiny bell to the door of your balcony to remind you of classic cafe doors!</p>



<p>If you live with a roomi, plan a coffee/wine date with them. Impress them with your new home decor, and lose yourselves to the changing skies of the city. Because we all need a break from that laptop screen every now and again.</p>
