<p>Ahh, Manhattan! A dream place to live in with raging rental prices that are no less than&nbsp;a nightmare. Folks, this is that place where money flies right outta your pocket. With rental prices as high as $12,000, most people moving to NYC, don’t prefer to stay in Manhattan.</p>



<p>But contrary to popular belief, living in NYC is expensive but not unaffordable. The trick is to manage your finances, learn to budget, and use our tips.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-living-in-nyc-so-darn-expensive-anyway">Why is living in NYC so darn expensive, anyway?</h2>



<p>Living in NYC can be tough on the wallet, there&#8217;s no denying it. But there&#8217;s more to the high cost of living than meets the eye. When you live in the Big Apple, you&#8217;re paying for more than just a cramped apartment and an overpriced cup of coffee.</p>



<p>One of the main reasons living in NYC is so expensive is due to the high demand for limited space. It&#8217;s no secret that New York City is one of the most crowded cities in the world. With millions of people vying for the same small slice of real estate, prices are naturally going to skyrocket.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s not all bad news! Living in NYC also comes with a ton of perks that make the high cost worth it for many. From world-class dining and entertainment to unbeatable career opportunities, there&#8217;s always something exciting happening in the city that never sleeps. And let&#8217;s not forget about the incredible cultural diversity and vibrant communities that make NYC such a unique place to live.</p>



<p>So while the price tag may be hefty, living in NYC is an investment in experiences that you simply can&#8217;t find anywhere else. And who knows, with a little bit of luck and determination, you might just find that the rewards of living in the Big Apple far outweigh the costs.</p>

<p>Finding an affordable apartment in New York can feel like an insurmountable task, especially in a city known for its high cost of living. However, with a little creativity and perseverance, it&#8217;s possible to find a hidden gem that won&#8217;t break the bank.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Find roommates</h3>



<p>Many people living in NYC save tons of money by staying with roommates. Even more so in Manhattan where rentals start from $1000 for a 1BHK (Bedroom, Hall, and Kitchen) or a studio apartment! Getting a roommate not only means cheap rental, but it also helps you cut down costs like:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>50% of brokerage + Security deposit (which is a LOT!)</li>



<li>Utility bills: water, electricity, maintenance, etc</li>



<li>Groceries</li>



<li>50% of additional costs like wear-&amp;-tear, home improvement, furnishings, etc.</li>
</ol>



<p>If it’s your first time moving to NYC, we recommend roommates or a co-living space. They&#8217;ll help you get acquainted with the city and help you save tons of money for the fun stuff.</p>



<p>To help you find roommates, use <a href="https://roomiapp.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Roomi</a>, the ultimate roommate finder app. You can find roommates who match your living style and preferences (making your living situation easier in the future!). Plus you don&#8217;t have to worry about scams or fake profiles, as Roomi conducts background checks and adds a verified badge to users who have verified their identity.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Winter is the best time to find cheap apartments in New York!</h3>



<p>Summer is the most preferred season by people living in NYC. It&#8217;s all about pleasant weather, busy streets, and the opening of college admissions. Hence, students worldwide come to NYC for internships and college programs. Resulting in super competitive rentals and difficulty in finding your dream apartment.</p>



<p>However, in winter, most students move out, leaving an array of options for a renter like you. You&#8217;ll also find landlords willing to negotiate and cut you a better deal.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Study and know the neighborhood</h3>



<p>So you’ve decided that you won’t settle for an apartment anywhere but in Manhattan. But, you can’t seem to ignore the glaring budget that you’ve set for yourself. To make your job easier, we&#8217;ve created a chart of <a href="https://propertyclub.nyc/article/the-most-affordable-neighborhoods-in-nyc#:~:text=The%20Bronx%20is%20NYC%27s%20Most%20Affordable%20Borough&amp;text=Citywide%2C%20the%20median%20sales%20price%20is%20%24760%2C000%2C%20with%20the%20Bronx,Manhattan%20being%20the%20most%20expensive." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">affordable</a> and <a href="https://equityatlas.org/most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-nyc/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">expensive</a> neighborhoods below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong><strong>Affordable Neighborhoods</strong></strong></td><td><strong>Expensive Neighborhoods</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Parkchester</td><td>TriBeCa</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Bedford Park</td><td>SoHo</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Lindenwood</td><td>Greenwich Village</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Fieldston</td><td>Chelsea</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Briarwood</td><td>Upper West Side</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Roomi tip:Living in NYC is all about being reasonable and finding ways to cut corners while budgeting. Also, research as much as you can before finalizing your dream apartment.</p>

The neighborhood is not as fancy as SoHo or Tribecca but it&#8217;s definitely unique. The Inwood Hill Park, restaurants, and tight-knit communities make this enclave worth the move!</p>

<p>New York City is crazy expensive, but some neighborhoods cheap apartments close to NYC. You can live close by and rent can drop off considerably. Roomi compiled a quick list of several neighborhoods with cheap apartments in NYC and around, under $800 that you can scope out on our site.</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like whenever we open our wallets these days, all we hear is crickets chirping. Which sucks, because New York City has so much to do. It’s a shame to miss out on all the events, music, clubs, and restaurants because rent snuck up on you and drained your funds dry. Again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This area is just west of NYC and technically resides in Jersey City, New Jersey. You can end up finding cheap apartments close to NYC with pretty good rents. But it’s a mere twenty-five minute drive to The Big Apple if you take the Holland Tunnel, so big city living is still within your reach.</span><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/local/New+York+City/Jersey+City/McGinley+Square" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://7seventyhouse.com/?utm_source=Google_Ads&amp;utm_medium=Search&amp;utm_content=%2Bapts%20Near%20%2Bjersey%20%2Bcity&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwrsGCBhD1ARIsALILBYpI-RP34al14t5gl9v_dSAwISOeskVfd-9TUfQJhMGTXWVgxX16zcIaArebEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McGinley Square </a>is close to Lincoln Park (the actual park, not the band) and Liberty State Park. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They present nice choices for diversions if you crave a little green. The</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://lsc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberty Science Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and they’re running a super cool MythBusters exhibit. Just in case you’ve ever been curious if you actually get wetter when chasing down a bus in the rain.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sandy Hook: $650</strong></h2>



<p>Finding cheap apartments close to NYC is as good as cheap apartments <em>in</em> NYC. <span style="font-weight: 400;">While Sandy Hook is a solid hour and fifteen minutes from NYC, it’s got something any self-respecting California transplant craves:</span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://seastreak.com/daytrips-and-getaways/sandy-hook-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">beaches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One of the closest beaches to New York, Sandy Hook has fishing, swimming, lighthouses, and more. Toss a Frisbee while you race across the sand or saunter up to a snack bar after work. As long as you can deal with the long commute, Sandy Hook offers a lot for the price.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rosedale: $700</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Situated in Queens,</span><a href="https://roomiapp.com/local/New+York+City/Queens/Rosedale" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosedale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has some incredibly cheap apartments in NYC for rent considering the easy access to shopping and parks.

Idlewild Park and the Hook Creek Wildlife Sanctuary are close by as well. You can enjoy a little stroll with your friends while you scheme up your weekend plans for the big city.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cypress Hills: $725</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based out of Brooklyn,</span><a href="https://roomiapp.com/local/New+York+City/Brooklyn/Cypress+Hills" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyprus Hills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is close to Queens. It’s got a pretty diverse population, accessible transportation options, and no shortage of apartment buildings. Several cemeteries border the north side, so that part of the neighborhood can be quieter with a less obstructed view of the city.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://roomiapp.com/local/New+York+City/Queens/Jamaica" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamaica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New York has a lot of history, accessible transportation, and diversity. It’s an area that has seen a lot of development and is an economic up-and-comer. Extensive effort has been put into gentrification, and while it has cheap apartments for rent now, it might not stay that way. Now is a great time to get on board with this neighborhood before it suffers from a bad case of success and succumbs to a higher cost of living.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Power To The Tenants: Rent Stabilization</b> </h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York has a long-standing program for stabilizing rent. It doesn’t apply to every apartment. But if you do some homework, you can find apartments that qualify. One important thing to clarify straight away is</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">there is a <a href="https://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/rent-control-vs-rent-stabilization/#:~:text=Rent%20stabilization%20is%20a%20way,less%20than%20%242%2C700%20a%20month." target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">difference</a> between “Rent Stabilization” and “Rent Control.” They have different rules, regulations, and exceptions. One is also much easier to find than the other. Rent Controlled apartments numbered about 27,000 in 2014. Rent Stabilized apartments? Oh, you know, about 1,030,000. Give or take. You can learn all about Rent Stabilized apartments</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here. Empower yourself with that knowledge, and you’ll be much better equipped to find an affordable room in NYC that will actually stay affordable.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Be Up Front: Negotiate A Pre-Pay Discount</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have the cash, try negotiating a discount in exchange for pre-paying a few months rent. It’s totally up to the landlord if they are open to this or not. But think about it from their position. Their biggest concern when renting a room in NYC is that the tenant won’t be able to pay. When you pre-pay, you are solving their biggest problem. On-time rent. That should be worth something, right? It can’t hurt to bring it up, and at worse, you just advertised you’ve got quite a bit of savings, thus increasing your chances of being approved for the lease.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Timing Is Everything: When To Find An Affordable Room In NYC</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apartment prices are like any other good or service. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/rent-report/roomi-rent-report-average-u-s-room-prices-in-november-2020/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Price</a> is set by supply and demand. NYC has more people moving in than it has apartments available most of the time, so prices tend to be pretty stable. But is there a time of year when demand tips ever so slightly in your favor?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yup. Winter. In general, people hunker down for the winter months, nesting in their caves with popcorn, hot chocolate, and a backlist of movies to watch. If you can afford to wait, you can find slightly better prices in the winter when people are less likely to move in. But keep in mind, folks are also less likely to move out, so while you may have better prices, choices won’t be as plentiful. And you are moving in adverse conditions, so have a plan and keep it safe.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Apartment layout</b> will affect how affordable the room is in NYC</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location and layout of an apartment directly impacts its price. When you see an advertisement for a floor plan, it’s not always representative of everything that’s available. There is always one or two apartments that just don’t quite fit into the complex. Like that skinny parking spot they didn’t quite have enough room for because the mall got in the way. Apartments on the ground floor are less expensive than the ones on the top floor. Being in the middle is typically less than being in a corner because middle rooms share more walls. Ask a prospective landlord about apartments with smaller floor plans in cost-effective locations to see what’s available.</span></p>
