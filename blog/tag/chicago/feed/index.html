<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How transit-friendly is Lincoln Park, Chicago?</strong></h2>



<p>Thanks to Chicago’s excellent public transit system, Lincoln Park residents don&#8217;t need to own a car to get around the city easily. From buses and rail lines to taxis and rideshare services, residents have several transport options to choose from. If you prefer driving, be sure to keep up with the news to avoid busy areas during rush hour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Walkability</strong></h3>



<p>With a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/IL/Chicago/Lincoln_Park" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk score of 94,</a> Lincoln Park is extremely walkable and among the top ten most walkable neighborhoods in Chicago. You can complete most errands on foot, making it easier for you to get your daily steps in!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Roads/traffic</strong></h3>



<p>Traffic conditions are not as good as they could be, and it&#8217;s hard to get away from congestion on the roads, especially during rush hours. The typical commute time for Lincoln Park residents is around <a href="https://stacker.com/stories/242/ranking-worst-commutes-chicago#:~:text=%2315%3A%20North%20%E2%80%94%20Lake%20View%20and%20Lincoln%20Park&amp;text=%2D%20Median%20commute%20time%3A%2030%20to%2034%20min.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">30-34 minutes</a>. Lake Shore Drive and Diversey are known to be dangerous for runners and pedestrians &#8211; so take extra care if you&#8217;re on foot in these areas.</p>



<p>If you’re in a rush, check the local news station as they provide constant updates on traffic around intersections and which areas to avoid.</p>



<p>For those who love to travel by car, keeping the scarcity of parking spaces in mind is crucial. You&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to find an open parking space, especially near older neighborhoods and waterfront areas.</p>

<p>As the epicenter of America and the largest city in the country, Chicago is also known as &#8220;The Windy City&#8221;. What are the advantages of moving to Chicago? If you are considering moving to America, Chicago has everything you are searching for. If there are any lists of things in the country, region, or even world that claim to be the &#8220;biggest,&#8221; &#8220;tallest&#8221;, or &#8220;first&#8221;, chances are, Chicago is on it. Probably several times. But before we begin talking about finding rooms for rent in Chicago, let’s tell you a little bit about this big city.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Chicago</h2>



<p>Standing bold and tall on <strong><a href="https://www.michigan.org/great-lakes/lake-michigan" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Lake Michigan</a></strong>’s southwestern shoreline, Chicago is anything but timid. Big businesses, a strong passion for sports, and beautiful architecture are a part of Chicago&#8217;s reputation for being a city that justly takes pride in everything it does. A two-hour flight from Colorado and New York gets you to Chicago which is in the center of the United States.</p>



<p>Another trademark of the Windy City, however, is its diversity. Chicago has the energy of cities like New York and Boston as well as the heartiness of the Midwest, with its blend of cultures existing side by side in the bustling metropolis. After all, it is described as &#8220;The City of Big Shoulders&#8221; and &#8220;The City That Works&#8221; with good reason. The city boasts of the country&#8217;s oldest zoo, the <strong><a href="https://www.architecture.org/news/evolving-chicago/chicagos-ferris-wheel-story/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">world&#8217;s first Ferris wheel</a></strong>, and one of the largest municipal libraries in the world as well as the largest collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding rooms for rent in Chicago</h2>



<p>Even the frugal can find Chicago&#8217;s cost of living high. A large part of this can be attributed to the high 10.25% combined state and local sales taxes, as well as the second-highest property taxes in the United States.</p>



<p>An individual&#8217;s monthly costs, excluding rent or mortgage payments, average $929 and a family&#8217;s monthly costs average around $3,400.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, you can still get neighborhoods with affordable apartments in Chicago</p>

<p>In Chicago, Illinois, the real estate market saw a significant shift in 2019, with home prices stabilizing and properties taking longer to sell. However, the market is once again favoring buyers over sellers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University life in Chicago</h2>



<p>In the United States, Chicago Public Schools (CPS), the third-largest school district, serves almost 400,000 students. The number of graduates has grown by nearly 22% since 2011, while dropout rates decreased by 50%, to just 6% in 2019. </p>



<p><strong>Some of the city’s <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/il" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">prestigious universities</a> include</strong> :</p>

<p>In Chicago, having a personal vehicle is not necessary for navigating life. It is also extremely expensive to park in garages and on the streets, but if you need a set of wheels, however, you can find rental agencies closest to one of the many rooms for rent in Chicago, especially close to the airports. There are several other ways to travel throughout the large city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Walkability</h3>



<p>Chicago is too big to explore on two feet, unless you are merely strolling around your neighborhood.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Roads/Traffic</h3>



<p>The layout of the city is grid-like, making it easy to navigate. But you must be aware of very limited (and often costly) parking during rush hour and heavy traffic. A number of websites and apps, including <strong><a href="http://spothero.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpotHero</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://parkchicago.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ParkChicago</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://parkchicago.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ParkWhiz</a></strong>, give you the opportunity to reserve spots and pay in advance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Taxis</h3>



<p>The <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://yellowcabchicago.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellow Cab Chicago</a></strong> is a convenient (though pricey) way to get to areas outside the downtown district. It may be more affordable to use a ride-hailing service, such as Uber or Lyft.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Public transportation</h3>



<p>More than 130 bus routes are run by the <strong><a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Chicago Transit Authority</a></strong>. They include express routes during rush hours, and they serve Chicago&#8217;s top sites, including many of the city&#8217;s top attractions. Several routes are available 24 hours a day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Airports</h3>



<p>Chicago is home to two international airports that are located in the heart of the city. These airports serve over 240 destinations with thousands of international flights daily. They are: <strong><a href="https://www.flychicago.com/ohare/home/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Chicago O&#8217; Hare International Airport</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.flychicago.com/midway/home/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Chicago Midway International Airport</a></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Cycle Friendly</h3>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/">Divvy</a></strong>, the city&#8217;s bicycle sharing service, allows you to borrow a pair of wheels whenever you need them. Divvy day passes are offered for $15; single rides are $3.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/is-it-time-for-you-to-move-to-another-city/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is It Time For You To Move To Another City</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Weather in Chicago</h2>



<p>There is a joke among Chicagoans that there are only two seasons, summer and winter, and it can certainly feel like that especially if you just moved into one of the apartments in Chicago. With temperatures dropping abruptly in mid-October, and no evidence of warming until nearly May, a heavy coat is a necessity at Halloween, and snow boots at Easter are not unusual. The winters in Chicago can be brutally cold with wind chills as low as below 40, while the hot summers in Chicago are delightful, generally in the low to mid-80s, with the famous Chicago breeze removing the humidity from the air.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cultural activities in Chicago</h2>



<p>There are thousands of free events, activities, and attractions in the city. The Art Institute and the Shedd Aquarium offer free admission on designated days. Lincoln Park Zoo, Garfield Park Conservatory, National Museum of Mexican Art, and Cultural Center are always free. The Park District organizes free events such as movies, theatrical productions, plays, circuses, yoga classes, and nature walks.</p>

<p>Moving to a new city is always exciting, but especially so if it’s Chicago. The culture, the history, the food, the sports- everything about the city is exhilarating! But of course, moving out of your comfort zone and into Chicago is a big decision. One that you shouldn’t take lightly. Like any other major city in the world, the city has its advantages and disadvantages. You need to do your research before deciding on anything. Which is where we come in to help. Roomi has got all the info you need to know before moving to Chicago. So, read on and decide for yourself if <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/things-to-know-when-moving-to-chicago-roomi/">moving</a> to Chicago is the right choice for you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you’re moving to Chicago, be prepared for the cold</h2>



<p>Well, it’s called the Windy City for a <a href="https://www.history.com/news/why-is-chicago-called-the-windy-city" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">reason</a>. The winters in the city can be brutal. So, if you’re thinking of moving to a new city for its cozy weather, Chicago might not be for you. Even by Midwestern standards, Chicago is cold. Because it’s not just the sub-zero temperature that makes it bad, it’s the wind on top of the temperature that will get to you. It might feel like days go by before you even see the sun. We don’t want to ruin the city for you, we just want to make sure you’re prepared for the reality. But if you’re someone who likes cozying up under a blanket and staying indoors, Chicago winters will be great for you! Not to mention, the summers in the city are delightful! It makes the brutal winter months completely worth-it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You don’t need a car if you’re moving to Chicago</h2>



<p>Oh yes, Chicago is a walking city! So, if you’re from <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-save-money-while-living-in-midtown-east-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York</a> (or any of these other 8 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/redfin-ranks-the-most-walkable-us-cities-of-2020-301001267.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cities</a>), moving here will be a cake walk (<em>get it?</em>) for you. Not to mention, the <a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">CTA</a> is extremely convenient and affordable. Honestly, the only time you really need a car is when you’re trying to drive out of the city on a trip. And even then, be prepared for a stressful drive, the traffic is not fun. So, if you want to move to a new city with a great public transit system, Chicago is the place to be!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should you rent or buy if you’re moving to Chicago</h2>



<p>If you know anything about Chicago <a href="https://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/taxes-make-chicago-real-estate-hard-to-sell/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">real estate</a>, then you know how crazy it is out there. Which makes the city much better for renters. Not to mention, this way you can even get a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate</a> to cover half the expenses. Plus, you might want to get the feel of the city, before you decide to buy property there.</p>



<p>But even if you were looking to buy your first house, Chicago is a great city to invest in. In fact, if you’re looking for a fixer-upper, Chicago has the second most starter homes in the country. So, if you’re thinking of moving to a new city, Chicago has some great options for you, whether you’re a renter and buyer!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nothing like a Chicago beach</h2>



<p>You might not think of Chicago as a beach city, but you’d be wrong! There’s some amazing lakes in the city that you just cannot miss. There’s about 26 miles of coast along Lake Michigan and it is gorgeous. We recommend spending all your free time during the summers at one of these Chicago beaches. It’ll make you forget all about the horrors that are about to come with winters.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some beaches you have to go to:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Montrose Beach.</strong> This is the only dog-friendly beach in the city. But that’s not all. You can go kayaking, rent a cabana or just hang out on <a href="https://www.chicagoharbors.info/harbors/montrose/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Montrose Beach</a>!</li><li><strong>31st Street Beach:</strong> A very popular destination, <strong><a href="https://www.chicagoharbors.info/harbors/31st-street/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">31st Street beach</a></strong> is completely free of charge with some very fun outdoor activities available. Don’t miss it!</li><li><strong>North Avenue Beach: If you’re in Chicago, you have to go to North Avenue Beach, it’s a must. With <a href="https://www.castawayschicago.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Castaways</a></strong> at a walking distance, this beach is an iconic Chicago destination that has a lot to offer!</li></ul>

<p>Chicago is a city with a lot of different influences. So, it’s no surprise that the different neighborhoods in the city each have their own distinct personality. And if you’re moving to Chicago, you need to know about each of them, before you decide where you’re going to stay. Because, as you’ll find out, Chicagoans stay loyal to their neighborhoods!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>North Chicago</strong>: So here’s where all the young folks are at. You can find some amazing Jazz clubs walking around, or go Boutique shopping or simply catch a game. It&#8217;s a great place for youngsters to socialize!</li><li><strong>South Chicago</strong>: It’s one of the most <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-tips-for-living-with-an-international-roommate/">diverse</a> parts of Chicago. From the Museum Campus to Chinatown, this is an eclectic part of town!</li><li><strong>West Chicago</strong>: West Chicago is gorgeous. There’s beautiful churches, monuments and murals. Take all your instagram pictures here!</li><li><strong>Downtown Chicago</strong>: This is the tourist part of town. Of course, check it out when you’re just moving to Chicago, you need to do the New city stuff. But we reckon you won’t be hanging out here much after that.</li></ul>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Aaron Sorkin&#8217;s drama had us all feeling some type of way, thinking about the long history of Chicago on film. <em>The Trial Of The Chicago 7</em> was the dramatization of one of American history&#8217;s most controversial court cases. But without giving too much away, the dissidence and oppression depicted in the movie resonates deeply with America today. So <em>The Trail Of Chicago 7,</em> got us thinking about other Chicago movies that capture Chicago&#8217;s essence like no other. </p>



<p>While there are tons of great Chicago movies, and even though it pains us to exclude movies like <em>Cooley High (1975)</em> and <em>The Fugitive (1993) &#8211;</em> here are our favorite movies featuring all that the windy city has to offer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Widows (2018)</h2>



<p>One of the more recent in this list, and quite essentially one of the &#8216;most Chicago movies&#8217;, stars Viola Davis, Colin Farrell and Liam Neeson in Widows. Steve McQueen&#8217;s masterful thriller heist movie brings forward an incredibly insightful script regarding Chicago politics in the late 10&#8217;s. Moreover, the director encapsulates the city&#8217;s beauty to the movie&#8217;s benefit. Additionally, the opening scene of a boat chase in Lake Michigan features a beautiful skyline in the background, and that sets the tone!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Untouchables (1987)</h2>



<p>Adding an Oscar to Brian De Palma&#8217;s name, this might be considered an ironic entry on this list. We&#8217;re talking about a certain Union Station scene! But what really get&#8217;s this on the list is how well it captures the city. From Sean Connery&#8217;s famous speech about the Chicago Way to meetings on Michigan Avenue Bridge, this is one of the Chicago movies that takes you all around the city. And you get to visit the Chicago Cultural Center, the Blackstone Hotel, The Chicago Theatre, The City National Bank and Trust Company Building!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Southside With You (2016)</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s forget the politics of this movie and just focus on the journey that it takes you on; the delicate and romantic depiction of Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson&#8217;s first date. Not only do the actors do a wonderful job, but this is one of the Chicago movies that truly mirrors the city in the 1980&#8217;s. Moreover, there&#8217;s even a plaque at the Baskin-Robbins at Dorchester and 53rd, which marks the spot where the Obamas shared their first kiss! Dreamy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Road To Perdition (2002)</h2>



<p>Sam Mendes and the master cinematographer Conrad L. Hall beautifully transformed Chicago&#8217;s cityscapes into the era of the Great Depression, leading to Hall winning an Oscar. Shot at the famous University Club of Chicago, the Pullman neighborhood, and the suburbs of Geneva and Evanston, this is one of the movies that capture Chicago just perfectly! Additionally, even the interiors shot on set were built in the area.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My Best Friend&#8217;s Wedding (1997)</h2>



<p>Julianne Porter, portrayed ever so beautifully by true Hollywood gold, Julia Roberts, spends the movie running all over Chicago. Whether it&#8217;s driving on Lake Shore Drive or eating at Charlie Trotter&#8217;s, she&#8217;s there. While some movies that capture Chicago like to use Chicago as a backdrop, P.J. Hogan highlights its beauty in all its glory. From Comiskey Park to Union Station, you could make the dream sight seeing list watching this!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Home Alone (1990)</h2>



<p>Few movies do what Home alone did to McCaulay Culkin&#8217;s name &#8211; that kid was everywhere! The movie was shot mostly in Winnetka, a neighbor of the suburb (Northbrook). And that&#8217;s where movie writer John Hugh actually grew up! The northern suburbs are wonderfully captured, as well as the quick trip to a church in Oak Park. It&#8217;s tough to think of the holidays and not be reminded of the portrayal of Christmas (and poor forgotten-about Kevin McCallister!) in the Windy City.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Blues Brothers (1980)</h2>



<p>Can this be considered the ultimate Chicago movie? It&#8217;s certainly up there. The hit comedy was shot all over the city, covering churches in the South Side to Downtown, you can even find <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.choosechicago.com/blog/arts-culture-entertainment/your-chicago-location-guide-to-the-blues-brothers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guides to its filming locations</a> online. In fact, some reviews called the movie weird, but the great thing about it is that it all works! Dan Aykroyd and John Buleshi&#8217;s odessy takes them all over the city, including sleazy locations like Van Buren flophouse, Maxwell Streed and Wicker Drive.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off (1986)</h2>



<p>Out of all the John Hughes movies that made it to this list, when you ask for a &#8220;Chicago Movie&#8221;, all we think of is the day Ferris Bueller skipped school! Ferris and Cameron heckle at Wrigley Field, the gang go to the Art Institute of Chicago, and then there&#8217;s the infamous parade sequence. Moreover, Hughes shot the movie almost as if writing a love letter to the city in which he grew up in and it shows.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">High Fidelity (2000)</h2>



<p>When the time came to adapt Nick Hornby&#8217;s hit book into a movie, it was decided that relocation from London to Chicago just made sense. The result? A movie that captures neighborhoods of the city that aren&#8217;t often shown on the big screen. Chicagoan John Cusack adds a natural authenticity to scenes shot on Wicker Park, one of the most artistically vibrant neighborhoods in the city at the time of shooting. This film now serves almost as a eulogy to the end of an era in Chicago, giving us glances into the days when people found themselves in record stores.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Dark Night (2008)</h2>



<p>This is one of the movies that capture Chicago very differently, but yet it does. This one&#8217;s not particularly set in Chicago. But Christopher Nolan&#8217;s beloved Batman movie used the city better than most modern era movies do. It takes full advantage of Lower Wacker Drive. Moreover, one of its best scenes is shot on a famous stretch of Lasalle Street. The overhead shots of Gotham City are beyond fascinating. And a special treat for Chicagoans as Nolan and his team transformed the downtown into something new and vibrant. This movie sets the perfect example for every up and coming filmmaker on how to use a city to the best of its advantage, instead of just using a generic cityscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After a long and gruesome move to Chicago, you’ve finally just settled down into your new <a href="http://www.roomiapp.com/get/RC_CT_RConnect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">apartment</a>. Living with roommates in Chicago can make a lot of things easy. And as you plop down onto the couch and kick up your feet to unwind, foreclosure is the furthest thing from your mind. You signed a lease — you can’t be kicked out unfairly, right? Even the most seasoned renting veterans, who will take the extra precaution of purchasing <a href="https://roomiapp.com/3-reasons-why-renters-insurance-is-must-for-roommates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">renters insurance</a>, aren’t secure if their building is under foreclosure. </p>



<p>Currently, there are more than 15,000 properties in Chicago under foreclosure, according to RealtyTrac data, making Chicago one of the top markets for foreclosed buildings. It’s not uncommon for a renter to be unaware of their landlord’s financial situation —&nbsp;all the more reason for renters and roommates in Chicago to know their tenant&#8217;s rights. So whether you just moved in or have been around a while, foreclosures happen. Here’s what roommates in Chicago need to know about and what they can do to protect themselves from foreclosure eviction.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Recent Foreclosure Eviction Numbers</h3>



<p>Here’s one bit of good news for roommates renting in Chicago: Scary numbers and all, foreclosures are at a nine-year low according to recent data. Renters can breathe a small sigh of relief with the hope that the housing crisis is beginning to subside. In spite of the promising trend, foreclosures are something to be aware of. Roommates should continue to keep their Spidey senses on alert for warning signs that something may be up.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/things-to-know-when-moving-to-chicago-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi’s Guide To Moving To Chicago!</a></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3 Warning Signs of Foreclosures</h3>



<p>It’s a nightmare as a renter to pay your rent on time each month only to find out your landlord hasn’t been paying the mortgage by way of an eviction notice. There are laws in place to protect renters if this happens (more on that below), but staying ahead of the game is key. Knowing the red flags that your landlord isn’t making payments will give you more time to prepare and make your next move. Here are three key warning signs your landlord may be facing foreclosure to keep in the back of your mind.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Your Landlord is Out Of Touch</h4>



<p>If you have a normally responsive landlord who is out of reach lately, this should definitely raise a brow. Also, if a property owner is slacking in regular maintenance or repairs and, again, won’t respond to your requests to get them done, then it may be time to investigate. Some local newspapers print lists of bankruptcies that you can check out if you suspect your landlord is in trouble, or do a quick search online typing in your building’s address and the word “foreclosure” to see if it pops up for sale on any websites. (Often, popular real estate sites will have their own section for these types of sales.) If you get a match, make sure it’s a current listing. Then, skip ahead in this article to the&nbsp;section on what to do next.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Your Utilities Are Shut Off</h4>



<p>You’ve been paying all your utility bills on time to your provider but suddenly find them not working. (Also, make sure your roommate actually paid the bills if you’re not the one in charge of this task.) If you’re positive you’re not in the wrong, call the provider immediately, and ask them what’s up. They’ll let you know if a master account from the building has made any changes and perhaps why.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. You Start Getting Unaddressed Mail</h4>



<p>We’re all used to the stream of mail from previous tenants, but if you all of a sudden start getting mail that’s addressed to no one in particular, pay attention. Open all mail that may be addressed “Occupant”, “Unknown occupant”, “Current resident”, or the like. These may contain important information about any eviction notices or property changes that will save you from any more sleuth work.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Protecting Yourself</h3>



<p>Once you and your roommates are certain your property is in foreclosure, find out the foreclosure timeline in your county. In states like Illinois, the timelines can vary by county, so it may require some quick research on your end, advises Wendell De Guzman, CEO of PCI Real Estate Investments.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Cook and Will counties have longer foreclosure timelines than Dupage county, for example. Also, it depends on the time between when the property is foreclosed and the time when the renter has to move also varies by county.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Depending on the county, you may have up to 90 days before being evicted. &nbsp;The seasonal time plays a major role in when you have to leave officially.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“In Cook county, which is very tenant friendly, one cannot be evicted during the winter months,” adds Guzman.</p></blockquote>



<p>Renters in Cook county are safe from being forced out under these circumstances from December to February.</p>



<p>Once you have a concrete timeline by which you need to leave, you can begin a new housing search. The harsh reality is you do have to leave, but make sure to take these steps to ensure you’re not cheated or held unfairly responsible for any fees owed by your landlord. If you can afford it, hire a lawyer to fully understand your&nbsp;rights.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1.&nbsp;Keep Your Records in a Safe Place</h4>



<p>Make multiple copies of your lease, security deposit receipts, and <a href="https://roomiapp.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-always-get-a-rent-receipt/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">proof of rent payments.</a> Don’t forget to note any attempt to make payments to a landlord who is not responsive. When protecting yourself from foreclosure eviction, this is absolutely key, says Guzman.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Keeping good records and seeking legal help are two of the most important things a tenant can do to protect himself.”</p></blockquote>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Look Out for Fraud</h4>



<p>Be aware of the possibility of devious people claiming to be the new landlord. Don’t hesitate to contact law enforcement authorities if you suspect a scam. Your eviction notice should have contact information&nbsp;where you can find out more if you’re unsure of something.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Explore New Ownership Options</h4>



<p>Another option renters can consider is actually buying the house. If the property being foreclosed on has a Federal Housing Administration loan, the renter can actually request Fannie Mae to become the new owner. Instead of Fannie Mae foreclosing on the house, it becomes the new landlord and the tenant does not have to move out, explains Guzman.</p>



<p>Another option that renters can take to avoid moving after a foreclosure is seeking out companies like PCI to buy the property and take over the official landlord duties.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“PCI is a cash buyer so it can acquire properties quickly preventing the house from being foreclosed on. With these two options, the renter does not have to move out. If the renter can prove he has been paying on time, Fannie Mae or a real estate investment company like PCI will be willing to have the renter stay at the property,” he adds.</p></blockquote>



<p>For roommates in Chicago and many other cities, foreclosures are a real possibility, often overlooked. Remember, a lease and renters insurance can only protect you so far. When you’re renting, you don’t get to make ultimate decisions, but you can protect yourself!</p>
