<p>If you are moving to NYC, one of the first things you will need to do is make a monthly budget and make sure you stick to it. Living in NYC means you&#8217;re in one of the most expensive cities in the world, and it can be easy to find yourself short of cash. Keeping track of your spending and allocating money to your various needs will help you not to break the bank.</p>

<p>How much you enjoy your student life in NYC will depend greatly on where you live in the city. Make sure you choose the right neighborhood and consider your all options before committing to an apartment. Living close to your university or near a subway stop is always a smart option. Make sure that you have everything you need, like grocery stores, gyms, laundromats, within walking distance.</p>

<p>One of the most important tips for college students is to find yourself a roommate that you get along with. Sharing a space with a roommate will give you a great friend and companion, which is especially important if you are moving to NYC for the first time. Rent can be expensive, too, and splitting it with a roommate can help you save or find a better place to stay.</p>

<p>Colors come in different shades, and so do college roommates. This is not unexpected; people are framed differently and have their worldviews (and actions) shaped by their experiences, cultures, and environments. Then, this means you&#8217;ll need different strategies to cope with different kinds of college roommates. In this article, we have characterized 10 different types of college roommates using characters from the Harry Potter series.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10 Types Of College Roommates: Harry Potter Edition</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. The faithful roommate (Dobby)</h2>

<p>Dobby may be a put-down little guy, but he will stay faithful and loyal to anybody that stands with him. In Harry Potter, Dobby has a large heart despite his situation. If he so much as believes in you, he will stand by you even if it is against the norm. Not every roommate becomes a good friend, but one like Dobby will be if you can look beyond his current state.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>Stick your neck out for Dobby and you can be sure he&#8217;ll be there for you, even at his peril.</p>

<p>Cedric is brave and bold. Much more, he believes in fairness and is quite trusting. He will not try to gain an unfair advantage over you, and he will do what he can to return every favor you render to him. He trusts the information that Harry gave him before the first task even when he had no reason to. He also returned the favor before they head to the lake for their second.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>Do good to this type of roommate and you can be sure you will reap it in folds.</p>

<p>This type of roommate is not much fun as they are constantly buried in schoolwork. Getting them to go on an outing may be a hassle but you can trust that this one will have your back. There is an additional advantage to having a Hermione; you can be sure your assignments will get done.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>If you have a dorm roommate like this, take advantage of their knowledge to improve yourself. You never know when what you learn passively will be needed.</p>

<p>If you have a roommate like Ginny, there is every tendency that you will feel intimidated because she will be unusually good at everything. But you do not need to be. In Harry Potter, Ginny is compassionate and caring (ask Luna and Neville). She’s also intelligent and strong. This kind of roommate may be shy at first, as Ginny was, but she will bloom into a strong and independent person.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>Enjoy the comfort of being around the all-rounder type of roommate. Maximize your time together by learning as much as you can.</p>

<p>Luna taught us that being different is not wrong. That&#8217;s because she didn’t care about the perception others had of her. Throwing a shade at this kind of roommate won’t get you anywhere. Beyond this weirdness, Luna was brave and loyal to her friends.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>You will learn from this roommate that happiness starts with being yourself regardless of what anybody thinks. This will help your self-esteem greatly.</p>

<p>Ron is neither a coward nor a hero, yet he is always willing to stand up for the people he loves. This kind of roommate has many imperfections. However, he is a work in progress and will overcome his shortcomings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>Give him time. Though there may be nothing immediately special about this person, over time, he will prove his worth.</p>

<p>This one values friendship but will not shy away from telling you the truth if he feels what you are doing is wrong. In Harry Potter, Neville risked the only friends he had at Hogwarts by standing up to them in the Gryffindor common room. He even went as far as to threaten that he would fight them to keep them from sneaking out again.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>We all need someone who we can trust to tell us the truth, even when it hurts. Keep a Neville close for this reason.</p>

<p>A roommate like Dumbledore is so open-minded that they will listen to what you have to say in all situations without first judging. In Harry Potter, Dumbledore&#8217;s mind was so broad that he needed a journal to account for his many thoughts so that he could return to them later.</p>

<p>This kind of roommate has made a few mistakes because they love adventures, and they continue to haunt them. They are often misunderstood and do not feel a need to correct the wrong impressions people have of them. They stick to what they know is right, and even in the face of death, stick by it.</p>

<p>Stick close to this one. He is loyal and will defend you to the last breath.</p>

<p>This kind of roommate is quick to attach labels and fill in the rest of the blanks. So, because Harry Potter is a Potter, he must be brash and act like a blockhead. Ron is a Gryffindor so he must be conceited, and arrogant. Despite the assumptions, they know how to hide their own identities and you will be wrong to label them based on what you see.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">College roommate tip:</h3>



<p>You never really know this kind of roommate because they are masters at hiding their true intentions. The best thing to do around them is to be yourself.</p>

<p>So you&#8217;re finally moving out and heading to college. With people from all backgrounds and walks of life coming together, there are many types of college roommates you will meet. Whether it is your dorm roommate or flatmates, be prepared to meet some interesting people! Here is a guide to the common types of roommates you will meet and how to deal with them.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate/">Looking for a roommate? Here are some qualities to look for!</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Types of roommates in college</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. The introverts:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l3V0dbWcERDPRglkA" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3V0dbWcERDPRglkA/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>They are the quiet ones who like to go about their lives without interrupting yours and can seem quite enigmatic. Having a small and close friend circle, they need time to warm up to people before opening up to them. If your flat or dorm roommate falls into this type, you will need to respect their space and privacy. Make an effort to understand them better and talk to them, but do not be pushy or put them in awkward situations! Introverts can be great friends once you get to know them better.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/kDND93uMTfsMOvvmqx" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/kDND93uMTfsMOvvmqx/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. The life of the party:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:83%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/U4DswrBiaz0p67ZweH" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/U4DswrBiaz0p67ZweH/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>These types of roommates in college are the very opposite of the introverts. They love chatting and opening up while getting to know new people. Everyone loves them and they bring fun and cheer to any conversation or gathering. These people can always be seen with a crowd around them and seem to have an aura that attracts everyone to them. They are great friends to have around and are always willing to have a conversation and are naturals are having some fun.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. The straight A&#8217;s student:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l0HlHFRbmaZtBRhXG" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlHFRbmaZtBRhXG/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Another one of the types of roommates in college is the smart kid. They are always on time for classes and can be found in the library reading up in their free time. Often stereotyped for being nerdy, they are actually very hardworking and determined to succeed. They are great friends to have around and will remind you to study for that test, and keep you focused on your academics.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. The carefree one:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:66%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/H7kfFDvD9HSYGRbvid" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/H7kfFDvD9HSYGRbvid/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Quite an interesting one when it comes to the different types of roommates, as they seem to be chilled out all the time. Whether it is that upcoming test, assignment, or the time crunch for submissions, they are always at ease. They can be great friends and their example teaches you to stay calm and take a chill pill from time to time.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. The social butterfly:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/fY5M0XMiE911HLOkd5" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/fY5M0XMiE911HLOkd5/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>It may have been just a week since college started, but these types of roommates already seem to know everyone. You can spot them introducing themselves to new people and happily chatting with their newly made friends. Everyone seems to know and like them, and they thrive in the social spotlight. These friends can help you improve your social skills and teach you to network better.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. The parent:</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/J20qFQarWK3XMwhdfi" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/J20qFQarWK3XMwhdfi/giphy.gif"></iframe>

<p>These types of college roommates are the parent of the group and will babysit the entire group. They are the responsible ones who will make sure you keep your room clean and take care of yourself. There is a lot to learn from them, and they are usually caring, mature and great people to be friends with.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dorms</h2>



<p>Dorm life can be great if you want an option that is easier on the wallet and more convenient. You can also put up in a college dorm or one that specifically caters to students. While privacy may not be a pro in a dorm, it can be great for the more social people among us. Here are some things that could help you decide if they are right for you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Social Life:</h3>



<p>In dorms, you will be living in close proximity to other students or individuals. This can mean that you will find it easier to make new friends and meet new people. Dorms generally have some social or recreation area. You can always kick back with your new dorm mates and have company. Dorms are a great way to get started if you are finding roommates in a new city or are don&#8217;t know anyone there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Utilities:</h3>



<p>Another area where the dorms vs apartments question has to be addressed is utilities. In a dorm, all utility costs are generally included in the rental you pay. You and your college roommates will all share the cost of utilities. As a result, you can expect to pay lesser for utilities as well as other facilities.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Free Amenities:</h3>



<p>Dorms will generally come with certain free amenities that you can avail of. Here, they have the advantage in the dorms vs apartments debate. Most dorms will have free WiFi, a laundry room, a recreational area. Some dorms even have gyms and televisions for you to use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Privacy:</h3>



<p>If you are someone who needs a lot of space and privacy, &#8216;this ain&#8217;t it!&#8217; While a dorm can do wonders for your social life, it can be hard to get privacy. Dorms do not offer you a lot of personal space and you will always be in the same room with someone else. If you find it hard to study or constantly be around people, dorms may not be for you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Budget:</h3>



<p>Dorms will almost always be cheaper than an apartment. If you are finding a roommate, that could bring the costs down, but will not beat a dorm. If you are on a tight budget, there is nothing better than a dorm.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Apartments</h2>



<p>If you want the apartment life, it does have its advantages. It is generally more expensive than getting a dorm, but you will have more freedom. There are also a host of options for apartments in terms of sizes, locations, and furnishing. Read on to see if this is the right choice for you!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fewer restrictions:</h3>



<p>Living in an apartment will give you a lot more freedom to do what you like. Having personal space means fewer rules like in a dorm. While dorm inspections happen frequently, they are less common in apartments and you be informed in advance. If you want the flexibility to come and leave as you want, and do as you like, this is it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cooking and food:</h3>



<p>One area where you can save by living in an apartment is food. In an apartment, you can save by buying your own groceries and cooking yourself. This can also be great if you have special dietary requirements. The option to cook for yourself is simply not possible in a dorm. Unless you plan on living off of cup noodles. (Oh, please don&#8217;t.)</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Privacy:</h3>



<p>As we said earlier, dorms don&#8217;t offer much privacy or personal space. In an apartment, you can choose to live alone or share it with a college roommate. This gives you a lot more space and can be important for some people. Personally, I chose to live in a studio apartment as I really need my space to recharge those social batteries.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Entertain guests:</h3>



<p>Here is a clear win in the dorms vs apartments debate. An apartment will allow you to have guests or friends over. While some dorms will let you bring guests, you will not have privacy or be able to spend time alone with them. Have friends over and party in your apartment or maybe catch a sports match. It&#8217;s all possible.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Budget:</h3>



<p>When it comes to expenses, you can always share with college roommates, but this is surely more expensive. In the dorms vs apartments decision, expect to spend more on rent for an apartment. Utilities and other expenses are also going to be additional costs that you will need to factor in. On the other hand, don&#8217;t expect the freebies and amenities that dorms provide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>College life is one of the most transformative periods in a person’s life. I mean, how could it not be? You’re meeting new people, in a new city (maybe even <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/find-room-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a>?!) <em>and</em> you’re away from the comfort of your home! It’s kind of like an adulthood version of throwing yourself into the deep-end of the pool, and waiting to see if you sink or swim. Of course, it’s not all scary. You’ll make lifelong friends, have profound experiences and a whole lot of memories! And one of these profound experiences is the one that involves you living with a stranger. Y’know, your roommate? Your college roommate, conflict and all, will always hold a special meaning for you. And as fun as it is to have someone to share this whole new experience with, roommate problems are bound to arise.</p>



<p>So, today, we thought we’d talk about how to deal with conflicts that arise when you’re living with a college roommate for the very first time. Don’t worry, most problems are fixable if you both have the right tools. And that’s what we’re here to help with!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resolve any conflict with your college roommate with an agreement</h2>



<p>We know agreement sounds like such a formal word. I mean, that’s something you sign when you’re an <em>adult </em>adult and want to buy a New York City penthouse or something. But you’d be surprised by how much this helps. Of course, this document is not legally binding, but that doesn’t mean it’s not effective! Writing down your wants, needs and expectations from your roommate (and vice versa) can really set the right tone for your relationship. Trust us, you’ll feel like you know your new roommate a lot better after reading this agreement. And when conflict inevitably arises with your college roommate, you can just refer back to this agreement. <em>This </em>is how you deal with roommate problems in a healthy way!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communication is key when dealing with college roommate conflict</h2>



<p>We know, confronting a new college roommate might seem like a bad idea. After all, you want to be friends with your roommate, not accuse them of causing problems. But that’s just it, honest communication isn’t confrontation (Of course, if you decide to scream all your problems in their face, it won’t help). But if you (kindly and gently) let your roommate know when they do something you don’t like, they’ll try to accommodate you. They probably didn’t mean to piss you off on purpose.</p>



<p>Not to sound too much like a marriage counselor, but communication really is the key to most of your problems. A conflict with your college roommate will only escalate if you don’t communicate with them. What is a mild annoyance today, <em>will</em> become <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-stress-of-poor-communication-with-others-4154175" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">unbearable</a> when you’re both stressed out about final exams later in the semester. So, nip it in the bud and your dorm room will be a safe haven for both of you!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t point fingers at them</h2>



<p>We’re just going to keep the marriage counselor vibe going for just a second longer and give you this one advice: don’t put all the blame on them. When you start pointing fingers at them and blame them for all your problems, they will get <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/love-relationships/words-matter-you-vs-i/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defensive</a>. This is actually advice that doesn’t just help you deal with your roommate problems, but problems with every other person. The moment people get defensive, they start (verbally) attacking back and that just doesn’t lead to anything good. And if your opponent is an 18 year old New York City college student, <em>oh boy</em>. So, maybe you should try telling them how their actions made you feel instead of telling them they’re irritating and a bad roommate. Sensitivity is key when dealing with a conflict with your college roommate!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If nothing else works, it’s time to call in the RA</h2>



<p>Your <a href="https://www.sofi.com/blog/pros-cons-of-being-an-ra/#:~:text=A resident assistant or resident,the residents of a dorm.&amp;text=Sharing information about the residence,campus activities%2C and available resources." target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Advisor</a> (or RA) might seem annoying when they’re enforcing “quiet hours” and telling you all the different ways in which you’re breaking University rules. But when it comes to mediating a conflict with your college roommate, they’re godsent. If your roommate problems persist and nothing seems to solve it, it may be time to call in your RA. Shoot them an email, or text (or snapchat, if y’all are cool) and let them know of the situation.</p>



<p>From there you can decide what action to take. Maybe the RA can meet with both of you one-on-one or perhaps a group session might be helpful. Whatever it is, an outside mediation can really put things into perspective.&nbsp; In the rare cases where nothing seems to work and you just can’t live with your roommate anymore, they might even help you switch rooms. Though this is a lot harder to do once the semester is already half-way done.</p>

<p>College life will throw you in a lot of situations that are less than ideal. That includes unpleasant roommates, but don’t let that ruin the whole experience for you. Honestly it actually might be good practice for if you ever move to New York City. Just remember, your roommate is only part of the college experience. And if you just can’t get along with them, there’s always a next semester!</p>

<p>When it comes to filing your taxes, the whole process seems extremely, *&nbsp;cough *&nbsp;<em>taxing</em>&nbsp;if you don&#8217;t have the first clue about how to file taxes. However, with a couple of budges in the right direction, anyone can take up filing their taxes — and still, have the option of hiring professional help in their back pocket.</p>



<p>Tax season dawns upon the American population in the middle of April each year. This sends a good clueless fraction of the population into quite the flux.</p>



<p>Add to that the number of college students that pick up extra jobs increasing each year. We, therefore, witness an increase in the number of people who would qualify as first-time taxpayers each season.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a compilation of the most asked questions by college students who are considering filing their taxes for the first time. Read on to find out more.</p>



<p>Related : <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/7-career-tips-for-college-seniors-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Career Tips for College Seniors </a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do I have to file taxes as a college student?</h2>



<p>Determining if you should be filing taxes in a year is something that depends on how much income you made in that year. If your earned income (wages and tips) last year, was less than $6,300 and your unearned income (interest and dividends) was less than $1,050, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/refunds">filing a tax return</a> isn’t required.</p>



<p>Even if you made less than the minimum income required, you still might want to file taxes. Say you were working during any part of the year. And your employer took taxes out of your paycheck. Turns out, you might be able to get a fraction of that amount back as a refund for your effort.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a college student&#8217;s tax status?</h2>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://giphy.com/embed/8c12cvfahEqP5O3dO2" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/evite-eviteirl-evite-irl-taxation-8c12cvfahEqP5O3dO2"></a></p>



<p>Be sure to talk to your parents before you decide to file taxes. While living away from home and having the choice of making your decisions may feel like adulthood, you may still be considered a dependant when it comes to taxes. (<a href="https://www.irs.gov">Anyone under the age of 24 pursuing an education in the United States can be claimed as a dependant</a>)</p>



<p>The IRS states that if you&#8217;re a student, your parents can claim you as a dependant until you&#8217;re 24. Thus, it&#8217;s wise to consult your parents about your status of dependency. This is because it may affect how you prepare for your return.</p>

<p>The difficulty of a tax form differs with every individual&#8217;s situation. After you&#8217;ve received all your tax documents, you&#8217;ll be able to determine the<a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-instructions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> tax forms required in your situation to file your taxes with the IRS.</a></p>



<p>However, if your tax situation is relatively simple, you might be eligible for the 1040EZ. The 1040EZ can be considered the simplest tax form available — it&#8217;s a single page document available online as a form or in paper.</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve filled in the preliminary details such as your name, Social Security Number, and address — consider yourself halfway done!</p>



<p>If your tax situation is a little complicated and you can&#8217;t use the 1040-EZ, then there&#8217;s the regular 1040 form. This form is relatively longer and more complicated than the 1040-EZ, but it isn&#8217;t more difficult.</p>

<p>There are two ways of going about filing taxes during tax season. You either do it yourself or pay someone to do it. If you&#8217;ve made less than $66,000 during the previous tax year and want to do your taxes yourself, you could use&nbsp;<a href="http://irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeFile, the IRS’ online basic tax filing software.</a></p>



<p>The IRS also has an easy to use app that can be used to file taxes called IRS2Go. It&#8217;s available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/irs2go/id414113282" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple App Store</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.irs&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Appstore</a>.</p>



<p>However, if you don&#8217;t feel confident enough about the process, or you&#8217;re on a time crunch or feel like you don&#8217;t know enough on the subject yet, you don&#8217;t have to file taxes on your own.</p>



<p>You can get help from a tax professional online, as well as in person. Your tax document needs and income level determines if and how much you have to pay to get your taxes done professionally.</p>

<p>Your search for professional help should ideally start in the town/city that you are in. Your campus itself might come in handy.</p>



<p>There are also students that are majoring in business who assist with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program.</p>



<p>VITA offers free tax help to those who generally make $54,000 or less, persons with disabilities, and limited English-speaking taxpayers who need assistance in preparing their tax returns.</p>



<p>These IRS-certified volunteers provide free basic income tax preparation with electronic filing to qualified individuals. If you do not have a network of VITA volunteers,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the IRS can also assist you in finding a location near you that does</a>&nbsp;— such as your local library or a community center.</p>
