<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-co-living-communities">What are Co-living communities?</h2>



<p>Co-living communities are a modern, communal form of living. Here, each of the residents have their own personal room and shared communal spaces. They provide residents with a personal room and privacy like an apartment. However, the communal or common areas are shared by residents like in a dorm. They are particularly popular among students, young professionals, and digital nomads. <a href="https://und.edu/blog/what-is-an-msw-degree.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Master of Social Work</a> students find these communities ideal for fostering a sense of belonging and support, while still allowing them to maintain the privacy needed for their intensive studies and self-care routines.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-budgets-in-co-living-communities">Budgets in Co-living Communities</h3>



<p>Co living communities will almost always be cheaper than an apartment. While having a roommate could bring the costs down, co living spaces will save you more.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-privacy-in-co-living-communities">Privacy in Co-Living Communities </h3>



<p>While you do share communal areas, co living communities give you your personal space. Thus, you and the other residents have your personal rooms. This gives you a lot more privacy compared to a dorm and can be important for some people. You will still need to share communal spaces and use common utilities. However, you can always retreat to your own room if you need a break or some &#8216;me time.&#8217;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-utilities-in-co-living-communities">Utilities in Co-Living Communities </h3>



<p>Another area where you save cash in co living communities is utilities. Here, all utility costs are generally included in the rent you pay. You and the other residents, all share the cost of utilities. As a result, you can expect to pay lesser for utilities as well as other facilities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amenities-in-co-living-communities">Amenities in Co-Living Communities </h3>



<p>Co living spaces will generally come with certain amenities that you can avail of. Some common amenities are free WiFi, a laundry room, a recreational area. Some dorms even have gyms and televisions for you to use. This makes it a hassle-free way to live without you having to worry about buying any appliances. You also do not need to head out every time you need something as all you need is generally there.</p>

While there may be a few appliances, it usually won&#8217;t be enough for you to cook full meals regularly. If you have special dietary requirements or just love cooking, do keep this in consideration.</p>

<p>We all strive to be the best roommate we can be, right? If you’re anything like us, you’ve come across your fair share of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-crazy-roommate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crazy roommates</a> and people with zero co-living protocol that just can’t seem to grasp the idea of a shared bathroom. (Clean up after yourselves, guys!)&nbsp;</p>



<p>While there’s no Roommate Handbook (as far we know), there are some roommate etiquette guidelines (<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelleno/roommate-etiquette-rules-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within reasonable limits</a>) that everyone should live by. If you don’t already know some of these, then – we hate to break it to ya – you may not be the best roommate. But don’t fear. Roomi is here to guide you on the path to a peaceful shared living space!</p>

<p>We hope this will help to prevent any future <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/2020/04/03/help-fighting-with-roommate-what-to-do/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">fights with your roommates</a>!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t expect the “cleaning fairies” to clean up after you</h2>

<p>Key roommate protocol: clean your own mess <em>and </em>regularly clean communal spaces! Never leave your own dirty dishes, clothes on the floor, or food packages strewn about the place – they won’t tidy up on their own, and your roommate doesn’t want to clean up after you, either.</p>



<p>On the same note, don’t neglect the communal spaces that naturally gather dust and dirt over time. Never adopt the mindset of “it’s not my mess so it’s not my problem,” because everyone’s responsible for grime on the floor and smudges on the bathroom mirror. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-declutter-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consider creating a chores schedule</a> if you and your roomis are struggling to split this naturally.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Neighborly etiquettes: Keep the noise down</h2>

<p>Look up the specified “Quiet Hours” in your own state. New York, for example, enforces quiet hours in all neighborhoods from 10pm until 7am. (So much for the city that never sleeps!) Monitor the volume of your TV, your conversations with friends, and the clatter you’re making in the kitchen when whipping up grilled cheese at midnight.</p>



<p>Similarly, find out what type of music your roommates listen to. If it’s different from yours, you might want to avoid playing it too loudly – even in the daytime. Your Katy Perry album might just make your Slipknot-loving roomi’s ears bleed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Always pay your rent and bills on time</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:53%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3oEjHLUI9nBwbzMyf6" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEjHLUI9nBwbzMyf6/giphy.gif"></iframe>

<p>This one is more a roommate ethic than a roommate etiquette. One of the main concerns with living with a stranger is a financial one. If this is the first time you&#8217;re living outside of your parents’ home, you’ll have to get used to paying bills and rent on time every single month. We know – it sounds like <em>a lot!</em></p>



<p>There are some ways you can help yourself stay on top of things:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Make a list of your bills and rent due dates</li><li>Set reminders; even just using the calendar on your phone can work</li><li>Set up automated payments wherever possible</li></ul>



<p>Maintaining a good record is good for your credit score, so staying on top of rent and bills does more than just keep the peace at home.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set roommate expectations early on</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3otOKCOHz2gIlic63e" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3otOKCOHz2gIlic63e/giphy.gif"></iframe>

<p>It’s important to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-ways-keep-peace-roommate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have transparent, clear conversations with your roomis</a> about etiquette at the beginning of your tenancy agreement. Talk about which stuff is okay to share and which stuff is off-limits. For example, you might be happy for them to use your milk when they run out, but you don’t want them touching your expensive shampoo.</p>



<p>This avoids any awkward chats further on down the line, and stops you from getting annoyed when your toiletries go missing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t overdo it on the guests</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:53%">

<p>Most roommates and housemates are happy for you to bring over your friends or significant other from time to time. When this happens a little <em>too </em>regularly, though, they can start to resent it. Having to share the shower and the sofa with non-roommates all the time becomes draining.</p>



<p>Again, talk about roommate etiquette before you move in. Find out what the expectations are around guests and come to an agreement you’re all happy with.</p>
