<p>The thought of a job&nbsp;interview&nbsp;can be quite nerve-wracking and frightening. It starts with &#8220;Oh, gosh! I hope they don&#8217;t see that long career break on my resume.&#8221; Additionally, &#8220;Jeez, I hope my GPA is good enough for them.&#8221; is often another scary thought. Scores and work history do matter in a job interview; perhaps you scored less or took a long career sabbatical.  </p>



<p>However, the bright side is that you are one of the few candidates who got selected!  Next step: dazzle your interviewer&nbsp;with talent, wit, and honesty.  </p>



<p>Pandemic job hunting got you down? Here are <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">6 Must-Have Skills For Individuals Seeking Remote Jobs In 2021</a>.</p>



<p>Read on for Roomi&#8217;s guide to nail your&nbsp;job interview&nbsp;and leave a lasting impression:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip #1: Do your homework for the job interview!</h2>



<p>To ace this job interview and excel in your career, you must research and learn more about the company. Think of accomplishments, goals, mission, values, and culture. Doing research will give you great insight into how you must present yourself professionally. </p>



<p>Study the job description to know how your roles and responsibilities align your career experience and qualifications according to that. You can easily discuss relevant topics in the job interview and shine bright like a diamond!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip #2: Study your resume before your job interview!</h2>



<p>Pretty obvious, huh? The truth is, interviewers often read up on your resume before a job interview and scrutinize every detail to ask you career questions based on it. Here is an example:<br><strong>Interviewer:</strong> &#8220;You finished your course in September 2010 and started a job the very same month. That was a quick career turnaround! Tell us more about that.<br><strong>Interviewee: </strong><em>Thinks hard about their career </em>trajectory &#8211; Where was I working in 2010, and what year is it now?<br><strong>AWKWARD!</strong></p>



<p>In case you are as absent-minded as the person writing this blog, we understand your struggle. The key here is to be thorough with your resume. Prior to your job interview, memorize the date and year of each of your career roles. Knowing exact details will save you from any embarrassment and help you stay ahead of the game.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip #3: Do a mock job interview</h2>



<p>For a mock job interview, you will need &#8211; a table, a few files (fake ones will do!) and a willing Roomi. Ask your roomi to pretend to be an interviewer and shoot some serious questions your way. </p>



<p>Traditionally, a mock interview should help you strike a confident stride and help you practice and perfect your answers. During the job interview practice, your roomi can also choose to give you ratings based on how genuine your answers sound. Win-win!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip #4: Dress for career success!</h2>



<p>First impressions at a job interview can last forever for your career.  It is thus important make sure you don&#8217;t walk into your future company for a job interview wearing bulky headphones and joggers. Talk about a career faux pas!</p>



<p>For instance, choose a business casual look even if your company has a casual dress policy. You can never go wrong with formal attire in a job interview. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tip #5: The correct body language for your job interview</h2>



<p>So you have some wait time before the interviewer summons you &#8211; don&#8217;t use this time to slouch and play games on your phone. </p>



<p>Instead, sit up straight with hands neatly folded in your lap. Try not to fidget or tear your hangnails! Finally, don&#8217;t forget to smile with everyone you interact with. Always maintain eye contact with your interviewer, a soft eye contact &#8211; try not to be creepy. Lol!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Basic interview dos and don&#8217;ts</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do: Eat a light breakfast</strong></h3>



<p>Try to avoid anything that can make you &#8216;gassy&#8217;. Boy, you don&#8217;t want to be breaking the ice and the wind together at your job interview.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do: Prepare questions for your interviewer.</strong></h3>



<p>These could include questions about your role, mistakes made by employees in the same and how they can be avoided or new upcoming projects for the company</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don&#8217;t ever: </strong>Talk about previous employees or company in a negative light.</h3>



<p>Instead, talk about your learning and positive experiences.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do: Take comfortable pauses</strong>.</h3>



<p>Feel free to pause to answer tricky questions. Better a thoughtful response than a nervous one!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do: Follow up</strong>.</h3>



<p>Make sure to check in with your interviewer or HR in 3 &#8211; 4 days.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Don&#8217;t: Discuss the details of your salary package (yet).</strong></h3>



<p>Politely ask for time to consider it &#8211; get back to them by the evening or the next morning.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do: Prepare commonly asked questions</strong>.</h3>



<p>Think about your strengths and weaknesses. Where do you see yourself in the next 5/10 years; why should they hire you?</p>



<p><strong>In conclusion, remember that your interviewers are people too! </strong>They understand that life and career have ups and downs. Perfection is utopian, and humbleness is truly all that matters in the end. No matter how intimidating they may look, be yourself and carry yourself with confidence. </p>



<p>All the best and break a leg! (metaphorically of course)</p>
