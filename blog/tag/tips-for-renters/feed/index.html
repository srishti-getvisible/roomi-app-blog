										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So you&#8217;ve finally decided to move out of your parents&#8217; house and bid life under their roof farewell. Living alone for the first time can feel like a dream if you&#8217;re tired of dealing with other people. You get to choose what city to call home, select your own décor, and most importantly, make your own house rules.</p>



<p>As exciting as it may all feel, it&#8217;s actually also your baptism into the world of &#8220;adulting.&#8221; Moving forward and living by yourself for the first time means being responsible for everything. This includes paying bills, cleaning up after yourself, doing your laundry and groceries, and even brushing up your cooking skills. There&#8217;s also the matter of feeling the occasional pangs of loneliness, which take some getting used to especially if you’re from a big household.</p>



<p>Still, living on your own could turn out to be your best life decision yet. Here are some helpful tips to help guide you through this whole experience, to get you settled into a solo routine you love.</p>

<p>There are lots of pretty and Instagram-worthy apartments out there, but you&#8217;ll also want to consider what neighborhood they’re in. Will you be commuting a lot to get to work or college? Then you&#8217;ll want to live somewhere within walking distance of the nearest train station and bus stop. Is there a grocery or a convenience store nearby for midnight cravings? How&#8217;s the crime rate in the area?</p>



<p>Be practical about your choice of the neighborhood when you&#8217;re living alone for the first time. Research the average rental prices in the places you&#8217;re eyeing to check if they&#8217;re within budget. Make sure you&#8217;re also feeling the atmosphere of the community—are the neighbors friendly? Is it a nice area for daily walks or jogs? Having that emotional connection can do wonders so you feel welcome and right at home in no time.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important that you feel as cozy and as comfortable as possible when you&#8217;re living by yourself for the first time. Depending on your personality, this can mean having a certain color palette or furniture or choosing a home with lots of natural light.</p>



<p>This is probably the most fun thing about living alone for the first time. Check out nearby garage sales and flea markets for unique pieces that make you feel good. Look for inspo on Pinterest, splash those walls with your favorite shade, and display artwork that lets your personality shine. Not sure about your personal style? This is the perfect opportunity to experiment and find who “you” really are!</p>



<p>One common piece of advice on living alone is to add a few potted plants. They’re a good mood-booster and we find it’s nice to take care of something.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll soon realize that going solo can get pretty expensive since you&#8217;re paying for everything out of your own pocket. This is why it&#8217;s crucial you come up with a realistic budget that you actually stick to when you&#8217;re living alone for the first time. List down the monthly cost of your utilities, Netflix subscription, gym, groceries, rent, and recreational activities like shopping and eating out. Tighten the purse strings wherever you can so you can keep an emergency fund. In case you&#8217;re wondering, that&#8217;s six months&#8217; worth of your income.</p>



<p>There are gazillions of budgeting systems online, that help you split up your spending into different categories and track your outgoings. Getting used to this level of care is difficult, but developing good money management is a skill to be proud of.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Here&#8217;s some advice on living alone: get to know your neighbors. This can be especially difficult if you&#8217;re shy or an introvert, but trust us, it goes a long way. Sure, you can always catch up with family and friends via Zoom or FaceTime, but nothing compares to establishing a sense of human connection when you&#8217;re living alone for the first time. You never know when you&#8217;ll need their help for anything, like keeping an eye on your house for a few days. You don&#8217;t need to be BFFs with them, but isn&#8217;t it nice to be able to say hello and smile at that lady across the street every morning? It will also make you feel less physically alone or afraid whenever loneliness strikes or in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>It can be hard getting out of bed every morning when you’re living by yourself for the first time. A little structure gives you something to look forward to each day and keeps you productive. Fit in time for housekeeping, cooking, doing groceries, working out, and doing the laundry.</p>



<p>Some final advice on living alone: Make sure you don&#8217;t pack your schedule too much that you end up exhausted. Squeeze in some time to grab coffee with friends, go camping, or visit that new art exhibit in town. Before you know it, you&#8217;ll find that balance where you have enough time for yourself and your social activities. Going solo is fulfilling and it can prepare you for the next stage in your life &#8211; whatever that may be.</p>

<p>As a tenant, finding out that your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/complete-guide-to-rent-payment-plans/">rent</a> is being hiked can be daunting. Rent increases are becoming very common, especially in high-demand cities. The a<a href="https://www.millionacres.com/real-estate-investing/rental-properties/what-average-rent-increase-year/">nnual average rent increase</a> is between 3%-5%, which is something you might face once it&#8217;s time for your lease renewal. The good news is that you don&#8217;t have to keep silent; you can negotiate a rent increase with your landlord. This will help you reduce the financial strain on you and your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/a-basic-guide-on-living-with-roommates-in-la/">roommate</a>, by keeping your rent stable. If you don&#8217;t know where to start, don’t stress! Roomi&#8217;s here to help. Here are some tips to help you get through a rent increase negotiation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-should-you-negotiate">Why should you negotiate?</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>It means more money for you. Say both you and your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-for-co-living-with-the-opposite-sex/">flatmate(s)</a> bargain $50 off your rent each month, that’s $600 saved each year per person! Rent negotiation will help you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/money-saving-and-financial-tips-for-young-adults/">save money</a> for other needs and rainy days.</li><li>If done right, it can boost the landlord-tenant relationship. Your landlord is human too, and how well you appeal for a rent reduction could improve your relationship.</li><li>Personal reasons: You may have developed a love for your apartment, and even your flatmates. Maybe you work close to your apartment and you’ve perfected your lifestyle. This may make you reluctant to leave and is a solid reason for you to negotiate.</li></ul>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-research-is-key">1. <strong>Research is key</strong></h3>



<p>Start by checking the market prices of similar apartments in your area, and find your apartment’s actual worth. If your landlord is trying to charge more than the market rate, then you’ll need to negotiate. You don’t want to pay more for a rental that other tenants enjoy at a lower price.</p>



<p>Part of your research should include talking to other tenants around the area. Find out how much they pay for a similar apartment and compare. If they pay less, you can negotiate a rent increase with your landlord, especially during lease renewal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-state-your-case-properly">2. <strong>State your case properly</strong></h3>



<p>Let your landlord know why you want to negotiate. Be as authentic as possible, and lay out the facts about your situation. Let them know how an increased rent would negatively impact you or your roommate(s). When you’ve done your research and understand more about the apartment’s rental value, it becomes easier to state your case. Preparation is key!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-bargain-for-upgrades">3. <strong>Bargain for upgrades</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re facing a rent increase that you can’t get out of, you can ask for an upgrade in your apartment. You may be willing to pay more to have an important upgrade or repair done. Don’t bring up a long list of improvements, but asking for one or two upgrades that reflect the new price is usually fair.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-make-enticing-offers">4. <strong>Make enticing offers</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l3V0GEwekqtkf5mWk" title="offer"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>When trying to get out of a landlord increased rent, you can try making a compromise. Think about what your landlord might want in return to make an offer they can’t refuse. Here are some things to try:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If you can see yourself staying in that apartment for a while, offer to renew your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/roomis-guide-to-lease-signing-in-new-york-roomi/">lease</a> when it expires.</li><li>Offer to pay rent a couple of months ahead in exchange for a rent reduction.</li><li>Offer to do something that raises the value of the property, like repainting the walls.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-state-how-good-you-ve-been-as-a-tenant">5. <strong>State how good you’ve been as a tenant</strong></h3>



<p>If you and your roommate(s) have a great tenant track record, use it to your advantage. &nbsp;Bring up how you pay rent early, or how well you’ve taken care of the apartment. Landlords appreciate tenants who are non-disruptive, so remind them how trouble-free you’ve been and how you plan to continue in that way.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-learn-how-much-the-landlord-can-legally-increase-rent">6. <strong>Learn how much the landlord can legally increase rent</strong></h3>



<p>Get familiar with local and state laws about rent increase and lease renewal processes. Go over your current lease again, and check whether it mentions rent increase rates. This will help you go into rent negotiations being both well prepared and well informed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-timing-matters">7. <strong>Timing matters</strong></h3>



<p>Choose your timing well when it comes to rent increase negotiations. It&#8217;s advisable to negotiate rent during these times:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>A few months before your lease expires &#8211; you can ask for a lease renewal in exchange for reduced rent.</li><li>During winter. Winter is a slow period for landlords since people move more during warmer months. They may be more willing to consider your case if they can&#8217;t find new tenants.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-be-calm">8. <strong>Be calm</strong></h3>



<p>Remember that your landlord probably has reasons for a rent increase. Being rude or lashing out while trying to negotiate won’t play out well for you. You have to be calm, patient, and respectful, so you don’t risk causing an even larger divide between you and your landlord.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-put-the-deal-in-writing">9. <strong>Put the deal in writing</strong></h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:105%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/VFYJXIuuFl6pO" title="writing"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Deals put down in writing have more value, and can’t be easily broken. If your rent negotiations turn out successful, it doesn’t hurt to have it in writing &#8211; signed by both you and your landlord. It may be in your lease renewal document or additional paperwork. Wherever it is, it’ll help you avoid legal issues down the line.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-if-you-don-t-want-to-talk-directly-you-can-write-a-hardship-letter">10. If you don’t want to talk directly, you can write a hardship letter</h3>



<p>Another alternative you can try is writing a hardship letter. With this letter, you can explain your financial situation and the burden a rent increase would cause for you and/or your roommate(s). Write the letter as though you&#8217;re in a real conversation, and properly state your case. You can even use some of the tips above, like mentioning that you&#8217;re a good tenant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-do-when-rent-increase-negotiations-fail">What to do when Rent Increase Negotiations fail?</h2>



<p>If your negotiations don’t work, and you can’t afford to stay in the apartment anymore, then it may be time to find a new apartment. There’s a lot to consider when searching for a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/hacks-to-help-you-find-the-perfect-apartment-in-nyc-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">new apartment</a>, but Roomi can help find the perfect choice for you!

<p>Living in big city can be a thing of beauty. Living in a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">city apartment</a> often times is not. It involves the neighbors who seem to have decided that 3 a.m. is the best time to push the ol’ bureau around. Sometimes it means walking out your door and into a mountain of trash. Or it’s losing the battle, trying to keep a cap on your utility bills when, in reality, your landlord runs the show. Ever wondered how you can stem the flow of cash from your bank account to your electricity bill? Here are five super easy, super effective cost- and energy-saving tips for renters you’ll want to know.</p>

<p>Alas, if only turning off an appliance was as simple as hitting the power button. Unfortunately, as long as it’s plugged into the wall, a machine is still sucking energy from the outlet. Much like a robot vampire. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, something as small as a <a href="http://energy.gov/articles/are-energy-vampires-sucking-you-dry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">cell phone charger pulls .26 watts of power</a>. This is when it&#8217;s plugged in without a phone attached, versus 2.24 watts when your phone is attached. It may sound like a small, no sweat difference. However, it adds up — to an extra 10 percent on your energy bill, if you’re not careful.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-easiest-energy-saving-tip-for-renters">Easiest energy-saving tip for renters:</h2>



<p>The easiest thing to do is to hook up your devices to power strips. Unplugging five appliances becomes as easy as unplugging one. And while it’s unwise to unplug something like the refrigerator, you can also cushion its blow to your wallet. There by keeping it at the right temperature (between 38 and 41 degrees) and well-stocked. Not full of old takeout and not empty, save for a six-pack and a bottle of ketchup.</p>

<p>Dads love nothing better than reminding you to turn off the lights before you leave; money doesn’t grow on trees, you know. And dads are so right. While flipping the switch won’t save mega bucks, the cost adds up: The Energy Collective estimates that <a href="http://www.theenergycollective.com/vbugnion/306361/what-do-our-bad-energy-habits-cost-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">five bulbs left burning overnigh</a>t can add an additional $110 per year to your bill.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-light-saving-tips-for-renters">Light saving tips for renters:</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Lighting is one of the easiest energy-saving changes you can make. Dimmers, sensors, timers and LED lights can be installed. These use less energy and last longer,” says Sara Abate, interior designer at <a href="http://ambience.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Ambience.ca</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So before you go to bed or leave for the day, take a tour of your apartment, (which probably won’t take long) and make sure everything’s off and unplugged. And if you really want to Dad-proof your home, consider LED bulbs, like Abate recommends. </p>

<p>While they can be pricier upfront, they “typically use about 25-80 percent less energy than traditional incandescents…and can last 3-25 times longer,” according to the Department of Energy, which has organized estimated savings into <a href="http://energy.gov/energysaver/how-energy-efficient-light-bulbs-compare-traditional-incandescents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">this handy chart</a>.</p>

<p>Keeping your apartment cool in the summer and warm in the winter means making sure that climate-controlled air isn’t seeping out and drafts aren’t blowing in. Seal up your space and enjoy watching your electric bill drop in the summer when 24 hours of air conditioning is no longer a daily necessity.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Drafts are the largest source of heating and cooling loss in the home,” says Mark Tyrol, owner of <a href="http://www.batticdoor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battic Door Energy Conservation Products</a>, who specializes in keeping leaks on lockdown.</p>



<p>“Imagine leaving all the windows open all winter long – the energy loss, drafts, and wasted energy. Well, if the home has a folding pull-down attic stair, a whole-house fan, a fireplace, or a clothes dryer, that may be just what is occurring in the home every day.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-energy-saving-tips-for-renters">Other energy-saving tips for renters:</h2>



<p>In addition to saving energy, this tip could also save you from a big-city pest plague: Locate all the cracks around your apartment and seal them. Install draft guards under the doors. Line windows and air ducts with insulating strips. Lucky enough to have a wall of windows? Invest in insulated shades, and keep them closed when you’re not around.</p>



<p>Tyrol also recommends the following draft protections if your home happens to have these amenities for:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The attic:</strong> Invest in an insulated attic stair cover.</li>



<li><strong>The whole-house fan:</strong> Be sure to equip it with a fan shutter seal.</li>



<li><strong>The fireplace:</strong> Look into getting a fireplace plug.</li>



<li><strong>The dryer: </strong>Equip a vent seal.</li>
</ol>

<p>The EPA estimates that the <a href="http://www3.epa.gov/watersense/products/showerheads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. uses an annual 1.2 trillion gallons of water</a> for showering alone. If you have roommates, you know how crowded a bathroom can become when everyone is vying to shower each day, and still there’s the pesky obligation to show up to work scrubbed and reasonably well groomed. But how do you get around wasting water without skimping on cleanliness?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-for-renters-to-keep-in-mind">Tips for renters to keep in mind:</h2>



<p>A low-flow shower head is an easy and cheap way to reduce your water use. HGTV notes the <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/remodel/interior-remodel/lower-bills-with-low-flow-faucets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">importance of choosing a WaterSense label</a>, as these “shower heads are about 20 percent more efficient than others and can save more than 2,300 gallons per year and 300 kilowatt hours of electricity — enough to power a television for about a year.” Similarly, you can install aerators to the tips of your faucets to reduce water flow from your taps. Another savvy trick? Sink an upright glass or jar in your toilet tank — it will remain full when you flush, saving that much water every time.</p>

<p>A surprise trash ticket tacked onto your monthly rent isn’t going to break the bank, but it is annoying, and it’s a reminder of your unnecessary contribution to your local landfill. It takes about two extra seconds to dispose of an item in the correct can, and doing so makes all the difference when it comes to recycling.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-saving-tips-for-renters-for-disposal-of-trash">Energy-saving tips for renters for disposal of trash:</h3>



<p>Put the paper products with the paper products, bottles with bottles, and trash with trash for proper <a href="https://fusionwaste.com/fort-worth/trash-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trash disposal</a> and management. While maneuvers like composting aren’t going to save you much money (unless you’re an active gardener, in which case you can save yourself a whopping $16.98 per year), your extra effort will cut carbon costs, and composting in a compact apartment isn’t as outlandish a prospect as you might think.</p>

<p>As for your cans and bottles, bring them to your nearest redemption center. You’re unlikely to get more than a dollar and change, but you will get the lasting satisfaction of knowing you saved a dolphin from getting his nose caught in your throwaway pickle jar. Actually, you could consider saving that jar — stock your whole cabinet with the free glass that comes with every jar of pickles or preserves, indulging your hipster impulses as you reduce, reuse, and recycle.</p>
