<p>Sitting near the confluence of the Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers, on the western bank of the latter sits St. Louis is the second-largest city in Missouri, United States. If you&#8217;re looking for rooms to rent in St. Louis, here&#8217;s all you need to know about the city!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know the story of St. Loius</h2>



<p>Before European settlement, the area was a regional center of Native American Mississippian culture. St. Louis was founded on February 14, 1764, by French fur traders Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent, Pierre Laclède, and Auguste Chouteau, who named it after Louis IX of France. In 1764, following France&#8217;s defeat in the Seven Years&#8217; War, the area was ceded to Spain. In 1800, it was retroceded to France, which sold it three years later to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. The city was then the point of embarkation for the Corps of Discovery on the Lewis and Clark Expedition.</p>



<p>In the 19th century, St. Louis became a major port on the Mississippi River; from 1870 until the 1920 census, it was the fourth-largest city in the country. It separated from St. Louis County in 1877, becoming an independent city and limiting its own political boundaries. St. Louis had a brief run as a world-class city in the early 20th century. In 1904, it hosted the Louisiana Purchase Exposition and the Summer Olympics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding Rooms For Rent in St. Loius</h2>



<p>The city is divided into 79 government-designated neighborhoods. The neighborhood divisions have no legal standing, although some neighborhood associations administer grants or hold veto power over historic-district development. Several neighborhoods are lumped together in categories such as &#8220;North City&#8221;, &#8220;South City&#8221;, and &#8220;The Central West End&#8221;.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top Neighborhoods in St. Louis</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to find rooms for rent in St. Louis, here are the top neighborhoods in the city!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Central West End</h3>



<p>Located between Forest Park and St. Louis University, this vibrant locale has it all. Its collection of restaurants makes it a foodie haven, and the business district along Euclid Ave is a walkable shopping destination with boutiques, bookstores, live music venues, and more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Downtown</h3>



<p>Living in Downtown St. Louis means you can choose from all kinds of apartments, lofts, and condos in refurbished buildings with tons of character—and many of those options come at very affordable prices. Downtown is also a great place to find a job, as Nestle Purina PetCare and Ameren are headquartered here, and the Anheuser-Busch Brewery is just a short drive away!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lafayette Square</h3>



<p>Everything centers around Lafayette Park, a 30-acre green space that’s perfect for walking the dog, going on a morning run, or taking a peaceful stroll in the evening. The park also hosts movie nights, food festivals, and a summer concert series, helping give Lafayette Square a strong sense of community. Better yet, this safe neighborhood provides easy access to I-44 and historic U.S. Route 66, so commuting to other areas of the city is a breeze.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Car Rentals</h3>



<p>Because St. Louis is such a car-heavy city, many visitors rent a car simply to get around with ease. There is a wide range of car rental services at St. Louis Lambert International Airport and across the city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Air Transit in St. Louis</h3>



<p>St. Louis Lambert International Airport, owned and operated by the City of St. Louis, is 11 miles northwest of downtown. It is the largest and busiest airport in the state. In 2011, the airport saw 255 daily departures to about 90 domestic and international locations and a total of nearly 13,000,000 passengers.</p>
