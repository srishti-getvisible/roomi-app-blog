<p>The holidays are here! That means parties, fun, parties, family&#8230; did we mention parties? They&#8217;re undeniably one of the best parts of the festive season. It’s a great opportunity to connect with friends and family and get into the holiday spirit. That being said, planning a holiday party that runs smoothly can be stressful. This year, you don&#8217;t have to fret, because Roomi&#8217;s here to help! Stay tuned, as we list out some holiday party ideas and tips to help you make the most of this festive season.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="holiday-party-tips">Holiday Party Tips</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-what-s-on-the-menu">1. What&#8217;s on the menu?</h3>



<p>When planning your menu, remember to mix things up. You can include a variety of dishes, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/cocktail-recipes-for-a-very-merry-christmas-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">drinks</a>, desserts, and bite-sized snacks.</p>



<p>Plan your menu according to the estimated number of guests, but leave room for more just in case. Use an <a href="https://www.brandcrowd.com/menu-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online menu maker</a> tool to design beautiful menu cards to let guests know what they’re eating.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-create-your-guest-list-and-choose-a-date-that-works">2. Create your guest list and choose a date that works</h3>



<p>Do you want to stick to close family members or will you invite all your friends, neighbors, their pets and the local line-dancing society?! Draft up your guest list early on and liaise with key guests to choose the best date.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-send-out-invites-early">3. Send out invites early</h3>



<p>Once you’ve set a date for the party, you’ll need to send out invites. It’s advisable to send them out a few weeks &#8211; or even a month &#8211; before the due date. Mail them in the post, old-school style, or send out online invitations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-venue">4. Venue</h3>



<p>Selecting a venue depends on the number of people you&#8217;re inviting. If the party can’t be <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hosting-a-christmas-party-at-home/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted at home</a>, consider booking a bigger venue. If this is the case, then book the venue early to avoid anything spoiling your plans.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-choose-your-decor">5. Choose your decor</h3>



<p>Decorating the venue is a sure-fire way to capture the spirit of Christmas at your party. The <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/christmas-light-decorations-for-apartments/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">kind of decorations</a> you’ll use largely depends on the theme you’ve chosen. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re going for a classic dinner party. You&#8217;ll need decorations like candle holders, or even flowers. We&#8217;ll get into great theme ideas shortly! For your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/diy-christmas-decorations-a-hygge-experience-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">decorations</a>, you can get a little holiday party inspiration from a movie or a local craft store.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-curate-a-christmas-playlist">6. Curate a Christmas playlist</h3>



<p>Nothing like good music to give some holiday party inspiration, and stir up the festive mood at your party! Make a playlist of fun and popular holiday songs —both old and new. Use platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube to create a festive playlist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-choose-a-theme">7. Choose a theme</h3>



<p>A great theme sets the atmosphere and tone for your party. It also determines the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/small-apartment-christmas-decor-ideas/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">decorations</a>, lighting, and color scheme. Here are some themes you can try:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Classic dinner party</li>



<li>Pajama party</li>



<li>Ugly Christmas Sweater</li>



<li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/6-secret-santa-gifts-when-co-living-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Santa</a></li>



<li>Tree Trimming</li>



<li>Winter Wonderland</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-plan-parting-gifts-to-give-to-your-guests-after-the-party">8. Plan parting gifts to give to your guests after the party</h3>

<p>Don’t let your guests go home empty-handed. Include cool parting <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/gifting-ideas-for-the-babe-on-a-budget-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">gifts</a> in your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-celebrate-enjoy-christmas-on-a-budget-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">budget</a> while planning your party. You can buy to-go boxes for guests to take home yummy homemade desserts and treats.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="holiday-get-together-ideas">Holiday Get Together Ideas</h2>



<p>It’s okay if you’re stumped on ideas for your party. Here are some fun holiday party ideas you can try to make that day memorable:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-fun-games">1. Fun games</h3>



<p>When choosing games, consider your guest list. How many people are coming and what mix of personalities can you expect? This will help you plan games and even prepare some prizes to spice things up.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Gift wrap game</strong>: This could be an individual or team game. Test your guests to see who can wrap a gift the fastest – with only one hand!</li>



<li><strong>Holiday movie trivia</strong>: This is a fun holiday get-together idea. Have your guests answer questions on classic and modern <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/top-christmas-movies-on-netflix-to-watch-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christmas films</a>.</li>



<li><strong>2 Truths &amp; a Lie</strong>: In turns, let guests give 3 statements, and have the others try to spot the lie.</li>



<li><strong>Jingle Bell Toss</strong>: See which of your guests has the best aim. Hot-glue cups to a surface, and toss jingle bells in them to score a point.</li>



<li><strong>Christmas Limbo</strong>: Find out how low your guests can go in a Christmas-themed limbo challenge. You can use a candy cane or a Christmas scarf to set the bar.</li>



<li><strong>Charades</strong>: Make your party more entertaining by having your guests act out their favorite holiday movies.</li>
</ol>



<p>Remember to choose the ones that will suit the kind of guests you&#8217;re inviting!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-christmas-karaoke">2. Christmas Karaoke</h3>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Another great holiday get-together idea is having people sing along to Christmas songs and carols. Sing songs like Feliz Navidad, Deck the Halls, Jingle Bell Rock, etc. It’s time for Christmas Carol-oke!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-watch-holiday-movies">3. Watch holiday movies</h3>



<p>Watching <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/more-christmas-movies-on-netflix-to-watch-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">holiday movies</a> is one of the most fun holiday party ideas ever! Offer your guests a great cinematic experience by sharing popcorn, sweets, or drinks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-cookies-and-tree-decoration">4. Cookies and tree decoration</h3>



<p>A <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/eco-friendly-christmas-tree-ideas-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christmas tree</a> decorating party is one of the most traditional Christmas parties there is. Make provisions for colorful Christmas ornaments for your guests to place on the tree.</p>



<p>Buy cookie decorations beforehand and let guests try their hand in decorating delicious cookies. Everyone can then swap their masterpieces after.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-pictures">5. Pictures!</h3>



<p>Picture taking is one of the best holiday party ideas because you get to save the fun party moments forever. You could even set up a quaint homemade photo booth to let your guests take beautiful holiday photos.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving is over, which means the Christmas season is finally here! Even though it’s still November, It’s never too early to start getting into the Christmas spirit &#8211; even if COVID-19 is making the holiday look a little different this year. This Thanksgiving, many families had to spend the holiday apart from one another to keep each other safe. Since Christmas is less than a month away, spending the holiday season away from family will most likely be the safest option. Even though it’s upsetting not to be with family, you’ll get to spend a lot more quality time bonding with your roommate. You might even be exchanging cool and fun Christmas traditions together. </p>



<p>Since spending the holiday season with roommates is a possibility, it’s important that you still make the season as fun and festive as you can. In order to start off the Christmas season right, try creating new and fun holiday traditions with your roommate! Here are a few ideas to help you and your roomi celebrate the holiday season together.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Build gingerbread houses to bond with roommates</h2>



<p>One of the most classic Christmas traditions! Making gingerbread houses is both fun and budget-friendly. Pick up a gingerbread-making kit at your local grocery store or order one online. Make an event out of your gingerbread house session by pouring yourself a cup of hot cocoa and watching a classic Christmas movie while you create your masterpiece!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Decorate the tree</h2>



<p>Decorating a tree is the best roommate bonding exercise there is! A Christmas tree is an essential part of Christmas traditions. Depending on where you live and what your budget looks like, buying an artificial tree might be a smart option instead of purchasing a live tree. Decide with your roomi whether a real or artificial tree will be the best option for you.</p>



<p>Once you’ve gotten your tree, browse stores such as Target or Michaels for cheap string lights to hang on your tree. Michaels is a great store to look at if you’re in need of affordable tree ornaments too. Choose a day together and spend it decorating your tree while listening to some festive Christmas tunes!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fun Christmas tradition: Hang stockings together</h2>
