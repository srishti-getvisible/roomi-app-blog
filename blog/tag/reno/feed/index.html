<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University life in Reno</h2>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>We do have public transportation, buses, that&#8217;ll get you to almost anywhere you need to go in the main areas of Reno; after that you&#8217;ll need a car, but there&#8217;s always uber. UNR has student dorms. There are good starting jobs here. The PCT and Tahoe aren&#8217;t far, with a car. Wherever you think about moving, you should find a place to stay there, and take up residence there for a month or so to see if it&#8217;s a good fit. Better than jumping in feet first and drowning.</em></p>
