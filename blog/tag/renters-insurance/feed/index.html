<p><strong>This is the image of a fire in the East Village of NYC three years ago.</strong></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The building was home to the famous french fry shop, Pommes Frites, the sushi restaurant Sushi Park</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> And, unfortunately, my friend Sean’s apartment (his name has been changed to protect his privacy).</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y</span>ou<span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/03/26/as-it-happened-building-collapses-in-east-village/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read about things like these in the news</a> but never expect would happen to you, until it does. Fortunately, Sean wasn’t home when the fire was blazing. Unfortunately, all of his stuff was. T</span>he fire consumed his c<span style="font-weight: 400;">lothes, computers, cameras, his bike </span>and <span style="font-weight: 400;">he had no renters insurance living in NYC. He heard about the fire through Twitter before ever seeing it for himself. </span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My friend Sean didn&#8217;t even know about renters insurance.</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span>nd <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean wasn’t prepared for this situation,</span> like most New Yorkers aren&#8217;t<span style="font-weight: 400;">. When writing this article, I asked him if he had renter’s insurance in NYC. “I didn’t even know renters insurance in NYC existed at the time.” In the perfect world, Sean would be an outlier. But the truth is, Sean is in the majority. Most young New Yorker’s don’t know about renters insurance in NYC, or if they do know about it, don’t have it.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s a big problem because a fire, burglary, flood or any other devastating event can happen at any moment, to anyone. You never expect them. You never think they can happen to you. They’re always the types of events you look back on after they happen and say, “I never thought it could happen to me.” </span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The good news is, Sean learned his lesson.</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I say that’s good news because (and I’m not lying here) the next apartment he moved into burned down, too.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not going to share an image of that fire, but this seemingly impossible scenario actually happened. He left his first apartment because it burned down, only to move to another apartment that burned down. Absolutely insane and unpredictable. </span>However,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the second time he had renters insurance in NYC which covered his losses.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people are people are living like old Sean, blissfully unaware of how important renter’s insurance in NYC is until it’s too late. But </span>it&#8217;s a good<span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunity </span>now <span style="font-weight: 400;">to get ahead of the game and avoid being one of those people who say, “I never thought this could happen to me.” </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems extreme, but that’s exactly how Sean felt after uber-ing to his apartment when he got notified of the first fire, unable to get with 1,000 feet because the fire department had closed down the lock.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Don&#8217;t Be a Sean. Get Renters Insurance</strong></span></h2>
