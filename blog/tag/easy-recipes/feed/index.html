<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Salsa</h2>



<p>Salsa is the most versatile out of all dips. Not only can it be used as a dip or spread, but it can also be added to your fried rice for that extra zing. While there are many options available at the supermarket, you can always count on homemade salsa to be healthier and more delicious. We have a super amazing Salsa recipe that you can modify as per your spice liking. You can also store this in your refrigerator for up to a week. That sounds like a functional lazy day meal to me.</p>

<p>2020&#8217;s quarantine period will go down in history as the time when home dwellers constantly wondered &#8216;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what the fuck should I make for dinner</a>?&#8217; Some people will tell you that this emotion isn&#8217;t just a quarantine emotion. But <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/cooking-in-quarantine-expectations-vs-reality-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarantine cooking took some really exciting directions</a> with &#8216;banana bread&#8217; becoming an actual trend. Who would&#8217;ve thought? Not me at least. Especially when I found myself looking for a quick and easy recipe every other night that I wasn&#8217;t cooking ramen.</p>



<p>So on the weekends, when you&#8217;re free from work and have no excuses other than laziness, you need to get off that couch! Pack the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-must-haves-shared-kitchen-recommended-nutritionists/198/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">must-have equipment for your kitchen</a>, take a quick vacation to the kitchen and treat yourself to the flavors of the world with these quick and easy recipes.</p>



<p>The best part? We&#8217;re not just suggesting quarantine cooking that will make your indoor-days a hit. These recipes are also quite swoon-worthy! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Poutine your quarantine cooking to use with some fries, gravy and cheese! </h2>

<p>Give it up for the perfect all-rounder of a dish, starring your favorite vegetable &#8211; the potato! It&#8217;s the ultimate meal of fries and gravy that you can devour as a snack, a complete meal, or a side dish. And if you have all the ingredients in front of you, poutine makes one hell of a quick and easy recipe!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For the gravy</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>In a small bowl, mix 3 tbsp cornstarch with 2 tbsp water and set it aside.</li><li>In a large saucepan, melt 6 tbsp butter on simmer.</li><li>Add 1/4th cup flour and stir regularly for about 5 minutes, till the mixture turns golden brown</li><li>Add 20 oz beef/chicken/vegetable broth and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.</li><li>Mix in half of the cornstarch mixture and cook on simmer for a minute.</li><li>Slowly add the remaining mix depending on how thick you want your gravy.</li><li>Add salt and pepper to taste.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For the fries</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Peel and cut 3 &#8211; 4 medium potatoes.</li><li>Fry them at 300° F.</li><li>Take out when they&#8217;re golden brown and crisp.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Combine!</strong></h3>



<p>Place your fries in a dish, and follow up with a ladle-full pour of that delicious gravy. Sprinkle a handful of cheese curds and devour as quickly as possible! Seriously, you want to finish this while the fries are crispy, the gravy is warm and the cheese is gooey.</p>
