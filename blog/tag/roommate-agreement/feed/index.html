<p>If you’re tirelessly having to ask for bill money, seeing someone have a 3-week sleepover, or wondering where the smell of cigarettes is coming from, you may have not taken the time to create a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">roommate</a> agreement.</p>



<p>Having&nbsp;roommates&nbsp;in NYC is often an&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-my-roommate-is-driving-me-up-the-wall-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">economical</a>&nbsp;necessity. Choosing the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/3-traits-look-roommate/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">right roommates</a>&nbsp;is half the battle among dodging potential creepy landlords and cat-lady neighbors. Now that you’ve settled with a few people with whom you share enough common ground to cohabitate, it’s time to team up and create a roommate agreement, to avoid any major arguments in the foreseeable future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-things-to-include-in-a-roommate-agreement">10 Things to Include in a Roommate Agreement</h2>



<p>Just as you sign an agreement to lease a rental with your roommate, you need an internal agreement too. Here are 10 things to include in a roommate agreement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-splitting-shared-expenses">#1 &#8211; Splitting shared expenses</h3>



<p>Your finances are why you chose roommates in the first place. Keep your wallet and boundaries in check by including in your game plan for when, where, and who pays up.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommates-split-utilities/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Splitting utilities</a>&nbsp;with roommates can be trickier than collecting for rent, so make sure all the details are worked out in the agreement. List the person responsible for collecting payment from everyone, the utility/company the payment is for, the exact amount to be paid, and date of each month it’s due.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#2 &#8211; Household chores</h3>



<p>Unless you’re a fan of cleaning up messes you didn’t make, household chores are a priority to include in your roommate agreement.</p>



<p>It would be wise to keep a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.care.com/c/stories/5933/ultimate-household-chore-list/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">chore list</a>&nbsp;separate from your roommate agreement.&nbsp;The chart as well as the consequences for following it should be mentioned in the agreement.&nbsp;Cleaning charts should be as specific as the bill schedule listing who does what, when. You could give the “clean up your own mess” theory the ol’ college try, but if it doesn’t workout then amend your roommate agreement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3 &#8211; Guests and entertaining</h3>



<p>Next up is one for the visitors, parents, boyfriends/girlfriends, and one-night friends. Set limitations on length of stay and details to be considered during a visit. This includes letting guests know there are house rules.</p>



<p>Here, you and your roommates can iron out a lot of other details like booze or no booze in the house, where to smoke (always outside and away from front door), and&nbsp;<a href="https://untappedcities.com/2016/07/11/cities-101-nycs-noise-pollution-and-how-the-city-resolves-it/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">noise level</a> or curfew. Keep in mind each other’s schedules, your Saturday off may be someone’s Monday at work. Not a bad idea to keep everyone’s schedules in-sight before throwing a get-together and inviting a bunch of guests.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4 &#8211; Communication styles (especially with conflicts!)</h3>



<p>Encourage open and honest communication by setting up regular roommate meetings to discuss any issues or concerns that may arise. This doesn&#8217;t have to be formal meetings with a confrontational approach, it could just be a simple meal together.</p>



<p>But when issues arise, having these regular &#8216;roommate meetings&#8217; can help resolve any internal issues you may have. Remember, communication is key! Talk about your problems and make sure that all of you are open to sorting it out to ensure a smooth relationship in the apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5 &#8211; Sharing food</h3>

<p>Discuss how you&#8217;ll handle sharing food and groceries. This could include each person having their designated shelf in the refrigerator or setting up a system for sharing expenses. But if you decide to share everything, make arrangements on a grocery shopping schedule. Or you could also arrange an inventory of all the food that you have and take turns buying food for the apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#6 &#8211; Pets</h3>



<p>Although having a pet can be a source of entertainment and happiness, it&#8217;s not all rainbows and butterflies. So, whether you or your roommate has a pet or is planning to get one, it&#8217;s necessary to include this in your roommate agreement.</p>



<p>You have to consider allergies, potty times, noises a pet can bring, and all the other factors included in taking care of one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#7 &#8211; Bathroom and kitchen schedules</h3>



<p>One of the most common things to argue about among roommates is the bathroom or kitchen times. So before any major argument arises, it&#8217;s better to include a schedule in your roommate agreement. Most especially if you have multiple roommates and just limited bathroom and kitchen space, making a schedule can help save the apartment from a disastrous morning rush.</p>



<p>To get started, make a schedule of everyone&#8217;s work or school time then figure out the order of who gets to use the bathroom and kitchen first. This makes everything more efficient and prevents anyone from being late to their schedules for the day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#8 &#8211; Moving out early</h3>



<p>Moving out should be included in your roommate agreement as it can get a bit tricky without it. Your lease may state the basics, but it&#8217;s important to have everything down to a T, like who&#8217;s responsible for what among the roommates.</p>



<p>Here, determine what steps need to be taken if one roommate decides to move out, including how to handle finding a replacement or dividing any remaining lease responsibilities. Consider these as well:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How much notice should be given before formally moving out</li>



<li>Finding a replacement</li>



<li>How to divide communal items</li>



<li>Returning the security deposit</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#9 &#8211; Quiet hours</h3>



<p>We all value our sleep, and no one wants to sleep with loud music or noises around them. So, it&#8217;s better to determine appropriate times for quiet hours to ensure that everyone has an opportunity for rest and relaxation.</p>



<p>Here, talk about who are light sleepers, who has early morning shifts, or just decide on a quiet time for the whole apartment. This could also just be a group chat message or quick chat to settle on a few hours of peace and quiet.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#10 &#8211; Violations of the roommate agreement</h3>



<p>When you sign an agreement to lease a rental with your roommate, you agree to certain rules and regulations. Failing to meet those standards can get you kicked out. Well, the same should be the case for failing to uphold the roommate agreement as well.&nbsp;While this is a seriously uncomfortable situation to be in,&nbsp;it must be done.</p>



<p>Having a roommate who doesn’t honor the roommate agreement&nbsp;can be infuriating to live with. If you&#8217;re roommate is a repeat offender, even with multiple house meetings and enough time to correct their wrong doings, it&#8217;s completely possible to ask for them to leave.</p>



<p>Clearly, someone who isn&#8217;t following the set rules is living as uncomfortably as those who prefer them. The agreement has been&nbsp;<em>agreed</em>&nbsp;upon and will result in consequences and really unfavorable living conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roommate Agreements</h2>



<p>Creating a strong and comprehensive roommate agreement is essential for a harmonious living situation in 2024. By including the 10 key elements discussed in this article, you can set clear expectations and ensure a positive environment for everyone involved. But before you can set roommate agreements, you first need to find roommates.</p>

<p>No one wants to have to resort to the option of evicting someone.

<p>The decision to evict a roommate is hard. If you&#8217;ve made up your mind, the first action to take is to talk to your landlord. Whether it&#8217;s a relative, friend or family member whose name is not on the lease, communicate with your landlord. Inform them about why roommate eviction is the best way forward. If your unwanted guest&#8217;s signatures are not on the agreement, then evicting a roommate not on lease won&#8217;t be a problem. Your landlord can do this for you.</p>



<p><strong>Warning: I</strong>f your lease prohibits unauthorized roommates or guests, you run the risk of getting yourself evicted too!</p>

<p>You must provide them with a formal notice informing them they need to move out of the property. According to your state&#8217;s law, you may have to hand the notice to them in person, send it by certified mail, or post it on the door of the apartment.</p>



<p><strong>What is included in the formal notice to evict a roommate?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The roommate’s full name, address, and unit number.</li>



<li>The specific ways the roommate is causing you distress as mentioned in the section above.</li>



<li>How long the tenant has to move out of the rental unit which will be determined by your state&#8217;s roommate law.</li>



<li>A statement that you will be filing a formal eviction if the behavior isn&#8217;t remedied or if the tenant doesn&#8217;t voluntarily move out</li>



<li>Lastly, the date of the notice and your signature.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Any communication with your roommate regarding the eviction should be done in writing. And, everyone should sign and date it. Breaking the law by changing locks, removing property, or threatening illegal action is never a good idea.</p>

<p>Depending on the state you live in, there are different methods to evict a roommate not on lease from your property.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Deliver an Eviction Notice:</strong> <a href="https://ipropertymanagement.com/templates/tennessee-room-rental-agreement" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tennessee</a> requires the tenant to file some type of court case under the state&#8217;s roommate laws in order to evict a roommate not on lease.</li>



<li><strong>Contact Law Enforcement:</strong> Some states like <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/33/01378.htm" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arizona</a> allow you to go directly to law enforcement to have the person removed from your home without opening a court case. If you live in a state where law enforcement is used to remove a person from your property, then you don’t have to do anything else. From here on, they will be in in charge of the eviction process.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>However, if you don&#8217;t live in a law-enforcement evictions state, you must give the person a written eviction notice before filing your court case.</strong> Additionally, you&#8217;ll also need to make sure that you&#8217;ve properly delivered it to the person you want to remove, or your court case could be dismissed.</p>

<p>In some states, a court hearing is required to remove a person from a rental agreement. In these cases, the person who filed the case must attend the hearing or the case will be dismissed. If your landlord has filed the case on your behalf, it&#8217;s still a good idea to attend the hearing. This is in case the court needs more evidence or calls you as a witness. <strong>In conclusion, there are a few takeaways from the process &#8211; store all evidence in writing, communicate openly, and take legal recourse if necessary to protect yourself. </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to a recent survey,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/31/more-adults-now-share-their-living-space-driven-in-part-by-parents-living-with-their-adult-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-in-three U.S. adults have had an adult roommate</a>. Americans are mainly sharing their living space to cut costs. But for many, cohabitating is a necessity, not just a preference. Whether you&#8217;re living with your best friend or an almost stranger you found on a roommate finder app, having a roommate agreement can make your everyday living easier. Having responsibilities and rules drawn out beforehand can prevent problems and sour roommate relationships.</p>



<p>The most common roommate problems arise due to conflicting values. Drugs, smoking, pets, cleaning up, different sleep schedules, lack of respect, and privacy are some common issues people face when dealing with roommates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a roommate agreement, and how can it help you?</h2>



<p>A legally binding agreement with your roommate, which is carefully drawn out to eliminate problems in the future, is signed between the tenants and has nothing to do with the property owner. An agreement should include your basic details. For example, your name, permanent address, and workplace details. You can further outline more information, including rent, utilities, lease terms, and more.</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/top-5-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Top 5 Things To Consider When Choosing A Roommate</a></p>



<p>We know how easy it is to miss out on the vital components of a roommate agreement, so don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ve got your back. Here are a few important clauses to include in your roommate agreement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Cleanliness clause in your roommate agreement</h3>



<p>The responsibility of having a clean living space extends equally to both roommates. And needless to say, each roommate is responsible for <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/dealing-with-a-roommates-obsessive-need-to-clean-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cleaning after themselves</a>, and common courtesy in keeping the common areas clean needs to be maintained. So cleanliness is one of the very first clauses to include in your roommate agreement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Rent &amp; utilities </h3>



<p>Your roommate agreement should state that rent is divided equally among the roommates and needs to be paid in cash/cheque/online directly to the landlord on the decided date. Electricity, internet, and gas bills will be <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/keep-track-expenses-roommates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared equally.</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. The clause of pets in a roommate agreement</h3>



<p>So agreement or not, our furry friends need to be taken care of. If you have a pet, draw out individual responsibilities and duties. Having a pet changes the dynamic in the house. Vet appointments, accidents, pet food, etc. need a separate conversation.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Leaving before the lease ends </h3>



<p>Another important clause to include in your roommate agreement is that roommates need to give a 30 day notice period before leaving. You can also add a clause that says they need to find a suitable replacement to fit into the space you&#8217;ve created.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Overnight guests and quiet hours</h3>



<p>Your roommate agreement should include the clause about guests too! For example: Overnight guests are not allowed for more than four nights in a row. Some notice stating that a guest will be staying overnight needs to be given. Within the same clause, you can add something regarding quiet hours, e.g., no unnecessary noise will be made between 9 pm to 8 am.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Smoking, drinking and drug use</h3>



<p>Some landlords require the tenants to keep the house smoke free. If not, you and your roommate can discuss the topic of smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. It&#8217;s better to reside with people who share a similar value system regarding this. And putting it down in your roommate agreement will work even better! </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Conflict resolution</h3>



<p>In case of a dispute between the tenants concerning a roommate agreement or any other aspect of your shared living space, you can decide that an outside mediator will help you make fair decisions and resolve conflicts.</p>



<p>And as with any agreement, the penalty for breaking it needs to be agreed upon. It&#8217;s essential to decide how you and your roommates deal with someone who needs to move out, someone frequently breaking the agreement terms or just a disagreement of what the contract states.</p>



<p>As a conclusion, having a roommate agreement in place will help you live a more comfortable life. When you have rules laid out, you and your roommate can co-live happily without having to move and settle frequently. So who knows, maybe having an agreement in place will help you find the Leonard to your Sheldon. All the best!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living in close proximity with someone means it’s natural to bump heads from time-to-time. Especially if you&#8217;re sharing a tiny NYC apartment. But in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, tensions can get even higher. You may be at a point where you feel like you&#8217;ve tried everything. Maybe you&#8217;re considering <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-tell-roommates-moving-out/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">telling your roommate you’re moving out</a>. Or maybe things are so bad that you think you need to evict your roommate. Roommate agreement be damned!</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, being able to finally cut ties can come as a huge relief. But before you get ahead of yourself, have you looked into legal (and moral) recommendations? Here’s what you need to know about evicting a roommate in NYC while the city battles coronavirus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do the NYC moratorium on evictions apply to you?</h2>



<p>Most of us have spent 2020 figuring out the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/can-i-leave-house-nyc-lockdown/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockdown rules in NYC</a> put in place because of COVID-19. If you&#8217;ve wanted to evict your roommate for a while, you’re already aware of the city’s moratorium on evictions. If you&#8217;re not, don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll give you a brief rundown. It&#8217;s basically a movement that prevents landlords from evicting tenants in both residential and commercial properties. And it has been extended until August 20th 2020. </p>

<p>The measure was put in place to support renters experiencing financial hardship as a result of COVID-19.  It&#8217;s a way to make sure renters don&#8217;t end up being homeless if they can’t afford to pay rent right now.</p>



<p>But, if you’re not a landlord and are just sharing a property with another roommate in NYC, does this no-eviction rule apply to you?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can leaseholders evict roommates?</h2>



<p>The current circumstances are uncertain for everyone. With new laws governing the rental market in all areas, both tenants and landlords are unsure about their rights. For that reason, we recommend reaching out to your building’s tenant association or a lawyer if you want to evict your roommate.</p>



<p>Remember that the person on the lease is the one with the rights, so if you’re both listed, you might have to battle it out and come to an agreement on who will be the one to leave. If you’re the one on the lease, you might be able to evict your roommate with ease- but again, check this with another source. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="http://www.metcouncilonhousing.org/help-answers/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metropolitan Council on Housing</a>, you have to have a good reason to evict your roommate. You can&#8217;t evict them if-</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li> They’ve lived in the apartment for 30 days or more and have paid you rent.</li><li>If you have a written roommate agreement with them that includes the length of time they’ll live with you.</li></ul>



<p> An exception can be made if they&#8217;ve breached the rules of the roommate agreement. Or if you can prove they&#8217;ve turned into a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-crazy-roommate/">crazy roommate</a> that you just can’t be around.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Before you evict your roommate, explore other options</h2>



<p>During this weird, stressful time, tensions can run high &#8211; we get it. If you can, try to talk things out with your roommate and see if you can cut each other some slack. Don&#8217;t try to evict your roommate right off the bat. </p>

	</div>
	


<p>We can think of <em>so </em>many reasons to avoid evicting someone right now:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>It’s a scary world out there at the moment. Evicting your roommate might put them in a very stressful situation. Searching for a new apartment right now has the added stress meeting people that could have come into contact COVID-19.</li><li>If you’re the leaseholder, paying the rent is your responsibility. Could you afford to cover the rent of another person if they were to move out?</li><li>The city’s housing courts are currently only open for essential services. So, you’d have to wait if you need to resort to legal eviction proceedings.</li></ul>

<p>Trying to evict your roommate should be your final option. It can be very unethical to put someone in a situation where can&#8217;t practice social distancing. And it&#8217;s impossible to find a new apartment without comin into contact with other people. NYC already has the most cases of homelessness out of any city in the US. You should try your best to not put another person the position of being homeless in the middle of COVID-19. Instead, try talking out your problems. Recognize that your relationship with your roommate are probably worse because of the intensity of lockdown. But if there&#8217;s no other option but to evict your roommate, give them sufficient notice.</p>

<p>Has the time come for you to fly the nest? Worried about how you&#8217;re going to inform your roommates that you&#8217;re moving out? There&#8217;s no doubt that this is going to be a difficult breakup. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-for-co-living-with-the-opposite-sex/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whether you’ve built a close bromance or you simply share the space, you want to do the right thing.</a>  Then there&#8217;s also honoring the roommate agreement you must be sharing with your roommate. You might just want to help them find a roommate replacement too! So, check your contract to find out what’s what, and let’s walk through the roommate break-up process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Check your roommate agreement, as well as your rental agreement.</h2>

<p>Before you make any hasty moves, you need to check that everything you’re about to do is legal. As well as rightful towards the person you&#8217;ve been living with.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Did you miss something important in your roommate agreement?</h3>



<p>A roommate agreement is basically an understanding you share with your roommate, on paper or verbal. This agreement allows you to ensure that the people sharing a house together are able to respect each other&#8217;s space, time, and boundaries. If you have a roommate agreement, make sure your moving out doesn&#8217;t interfere with our roommate&#8217;s daily life. Just ensure you&#8217;re not doing so at a time when they have an important test or interview scheduled. Also, try your best to inform them about your move well before time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check and re-check your lease and rental agreements.</h3>



<p>Both your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-happens-roommate-breaks-lease/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">lease and rental agreement, if broken</a>, can land you into real trouble. Most rental agreements last for one year, although this varies between properties. You’ll need to know what kind of lease you signed up for. And, if you’re leaving before the end of your agreed-upon tenancy, you’ll need to find out what the process is.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">When checking your lease and/or rental agreement, do not miss out on the following:</h4>



<ol class="has-normal-font-size wp-block-list"><li>The end-of-lease date</li><li>Any clauses about breaking a lease early</li><li>The costs associated with transferring a name on a lease</li><li>The length of notice you need to give if you wish to vacate the property</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you&#8217;re not sure about moving out, don&#8217;t.</h2>

<p>Before telling your roommates that you’re ready to go, it’s time to have some internal conversations to make sure it’s really what you want to do. If there are any issues that could be resolved, consider staying put and working them out instead. Moving out is all fine and dandy until people realize that they were never ready to in the first place.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/this-is-why-you-should-be-moving-in-the-winter-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moving out can be pretty stressful</a> &#8211; <em>especially </em>if you’re trying to leave before the end of your tenancy agreement. There can be costs involved with name transfers, hiring moving companies, and you can often expect some cleaning costs to be deducted from your deposit (unless you guys have been super careful.)</p>



<p>If you’ve made up your mind and you just can’t wait to move in with your partner and a cockapoo puppy, then you’re ready for the conversation. You already have your reasons for wanting to leave, so at this point, you probably won’t succumb to your roommate(s) potential persuasions that might come your way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Honor your roommate agreement and give them fair notice.</h2>

<p>Parting on good terms starts with giving your roomis plenty of notice before you leave. It makes the whole process a little lighter on everyone and affords enough time for you to find a replacement. If you have a roommate agreement, you must honour it for the sake of the time you spent living with your roommate.</p>



<p>Try giving at least four weeks notice, and then you can work together to get the room filled and lessen the financial strain on everyone involved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving out with an “It’s not you, it’s me.”</h2>



<p>Telling your roommates you’re leaving is similar to a break-up &#8211; <em>really. </em>It’s a tough conversation and it’s natural to feel anxious beforehand. You already know what you’re going to say, so stick to the script.</p>



<p>Tell them exactly why you’re leaving, and leave anything negative out of it. Explain that you’ve made great memories in this apartment but it’s time for you to move on because of x reason. Whatever you do, keep the conversation light-hearted, because you don’t want your next four weeks to be awkward.</p>



<p>Have the conversation in your home where you both feel comfortable, and keep it as short and painless as possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Help ease the strain by finding them a roommate replacement!</h2>



<p>Your lease agreement may or may not require that you find a roommate replacement should you wish to move out. But either way, we recommend helping your soon-to-be-ex-roommates fill your room.</p>



<p>You can try posting advertisements on Facebook groups or you can use a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate finding tool </a>like Roomi, which uses a verified community of people looking for homes or housemates. Either way, share the responsibility with your roommates and make sure when you leave, you clean out all of your stuff, so they’re not left with any junk.</p>



<p>D’you know what else Roomi does outside of helping its readers find the best way to inform their roommates about them moving out?

<p>Ideally, the roommate that breaks the lease should tell your landlord as soon as possible. Re-read the lease to look for any early termination clauses and make sure you all understand the terms. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/getting-out-of-a-sitch-with-your-landlord-renting-in-la-part-2/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Be upfront with your landlord about the situation and find out what the next steps should be.</a></p>



<p>Some landlords understand that things change and they’ll work with you to come up with a solution. However, since all of your names are on the lease, you’re all responsible to withhold your end of the legal contract. And it&#8217;s important to remember that not all landlords are willing to allow you to break it. </p>



<p>Whether or not you end up as one of the lucky ones here, you can probably expect to pay a fee. (Although, in our experience, the roommate that breaks the lease usually foots the bill for the fee.)</p>

<p>The toughest part about ending up in a situation where a roommate breaks the lease is that the responsibility falls on all of you. Since both of your names are on the rent agreement, any backlash is on anyone that lives on the property.</p>



<p>Talk to your landlord about finding a replacement to help you cover the rent. Depending on their policy, they might be able to help, or it could be a job for the current tenants. If it’s on you, consider reaching out to your social networks or use a <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/s/newyorkcity?duration=Any&amp;gender=Either&amp;maxPrice=10000&amp;minPrice=0&amp;region=571047f2dad86e202084d730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">roommate finding service</a> like <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi</a> to search for potential new roommates that have already been screened professionally.</p>



<p>Remember that your landlord will probably want to approve this person before their move-in can be confirmed. Inform them of the fact they’ll have to go through the usual process before a new rent agreement can be written up &#8211; so they’ll need to prepare things like proof of income, rental history, and references.</p>

<p>We recommend protecting yourself from a departing roommate, especially the kind of roommate that breaks the lease. This is so you don’t get landed with paying their portion of the rent. You could consider putting together an agreement that contains points that say your roommate will:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pay their remaining chunk of the rent and bills</li>



<li>Help you find a replacement roommate</li>



<li>Pay for any damage they caused</li>



<li>Give up any claim to be a tenant</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the best ways to avoid a situation like such where a roommate breaks the lease is to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sign-roommate-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write up a roommate agreement</a> before you start living with them. Here are some of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/essential-clauses-for-a-roommate-agreement-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the clauses you MUST include in your roommate agreement.</a> (Note: This is not the same as a rental agreement)</p>

<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-etiquette-guidelines/">People don’t always honor their responsibilities</a> and if you have a roommate that disappears without giving you any notice or paying what they owe, that leaves you in a very sticky situation. What can you do if/when this happens?</p>



<p>You could consider taking them to a small claims court to recover what they owe. You won’t need a lawyer and the process is relatively quick and simple; you’ll just need to take the lease and explain what happened. If the roommate doesn’t show up, the result will automatically be in your favor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever you do, don’t think about following in their fleeing footsteps and running away from your responsibilities, too! The thought of having to cover more rent and bills can be overwhelming, but remember that you have rights and it’s in your best interests to fulfill your rental agreement.<br>If you do want to move out, follow the proper procedure. Give your landlord plenty of notice and be prepared to pay any remaining rent or bills that you owe. Some landlords might not allow you to break out of the entire lease early &#8211; but others are more accommodating, and simple honesty could go a long way. Just refusing to pay rent could land you in a claims court, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/2020/03/16/late-rent-payments-credit-score/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late rental payments could affect your credit score</a> &#8211; so consider the consequences before making any impulsive decisions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>These days it’s common for even the hardest working young professionals to have roommates well into their careers as a way to save money. So maintaining a peaceful coexistence in your shared living space couldn’t be more important. That&#8217;s where a roommate agreement comes in. Whether you’re best friends or strangers, getting along with your roommate on the most basic level is a necessity. And that involves some ground rules and mutual agreements. You have an agreement with your landlord — why not with your housemates too?&nbsp;Here’s why you should have an agreement with your roommates, according to the experts.</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-happens-roommate-breaks-lease/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>What Happens If One Roommate Breaks The Lease?</strong></a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Protect yourself with an agreement with your roommates</h2>



<p>There are a number of reasons why signing a roommate agreement is the first thing you should do when you move in with a new roommate. Just like signing a lease with your landlord, licensed real estate salesperson Alex Mecum&nbsp;of DSA Realty&nbsp;says that a roommate agreement is a good way to safeguard yourself from any problems down the road, especially when dealing with finances. </p>



<p>For example: Is there only a person responsible for paying the entire rent? Then you should definitely consider signing a roommate agreement.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>It’s ultimately most important what your landlord will acknowledge. The landlord’s only legal responsibility is to the leaseholder, so if only one roommate is the sole leaseholder, I’d recommend drawing up an agreement,” says Mecum. “You want to protect both parties, so the ‘leaseholder’ or ‘tenant’ roommate knows the ‘occupant’ roommate won’t bail on rent, and the occupant knows the leaseholder won’t kick him out of the apartment.</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create an agreement with your roommates on your own!</h2>

<p>Aside from&nbsp;financial matters, a roommate agreement clarifies day-to-day stuff that can ultimately make or break a roommate relationship if both parties aren’t on the same page. For example, how do you both feel about overnight guests? Who’s in charge of handling utilities? What about household chores? (Trust us: A roommate agreement could be the difference in an empty kitchen sink or <a href="https://roomiapp.com/deal-roommate-doesnt-dishes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">this catastrophe</a>.) Here are some tips to getting started:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Draw Up the Terms</h3>



<p>Sit down with your roommate over coffee or a glass of wine and draw up your own unique contract. Open up about past issues with roommates that you’d like to avoid this time around, and list any and all your deal-breakers up front. If you want to be super thorough, Nolo offers a great list of points to cover while drawing up your roommate agreement and a sample agreement you can follow.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Print a Standard Agreement&nbsp;Off the Internet</h3>



<p>If you aren’t sure where to start or would rather just take a more formal approach, websites like The Law Depot can walk you through <a href="http://www.lawdepot.com/contracts/residential-lease/?loc=USNY&amp;pid=googleppc-reslse_usny-rentalT1_d10-ggkey_roommate%20rental%20agreement%20form&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwqNiwBRDnq93MioaqtKQBEiQAb7EznxG5gX2xoYzUz3hP4O4noqYfBn_ViWakYffPT_zWumoaAqvS8P8HAQ#.Vh1CBBNVhBd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preparing a professional agreement</a>. Answer a few questions, fill out the necessary info, and you’re good to go. If it’s in your budget, you could consider consulting with attorney directly, though it is a costly option.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Get it Notarized</h3>



<p>Once the contract is drawn, have all parties sign and get it notarized to make it official. It’s important to note that notarizing a document does not indicate its legality. Ultimately it’s an agreement made in good faith.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“A roommate agreement is only binding as far as both parties agree to it,” Mecum says. “It’s about writing out terms that make sense for you and communicating clearly with your roommate.”</p></blockquote>



<p>A roommate agreement is the best way to avoid a messy split and enjoy the perks of having a roommate. In addition to saving money, the right roommate can introduce you to a new culture you may have otherwise not had the opportunity to experience. Even better, it could be the beginning of a lifelong friendship. It’s all about starting out on the right foot and holding up your end of the deal. In the game of rentals, it’s always better to be safe than sorry — even when it comes to deciding how to split toilet paper costs.</p>
