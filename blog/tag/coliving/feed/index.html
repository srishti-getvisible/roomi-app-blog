										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living in a sharehouse can be a rewarding experience, offering both companionship and cost-saving benefits. However, with multiple people coming and going, it can also present unique security challenges. Ensuring your shared space is safe should be your top priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, there are practical steps you can take to enhance the safety of your home. From installing quality locks to utilizing smart technology and holding regular house meetings, these tips will help create a secure environment where everyone feels protected and at ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s explore ten essential strategies to safeguard your sharehouse effectively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-tips-on-securing-your-sharehouse">10 Tips on Securing Your Sharehouse</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-install-quality-locks">1. Install Quality Locks</h3>



<p>Having quality locks on all entry points is crucial for your safety in a shared house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure each door has a strong deadbolt, as these are much harder to tamper with than standard locks. It&#8217;s also wise to change the locks whenever someone moves out, reducing the risk of unauthorized access by previous tenants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might consider consulting professional services like <a href="https://mammothsecurity.com/">Mammoth Security Inc.</a>, which offers commercial security solutions for businesses but also provides solutions that can be adapted for residential needs.</p>



<p>Remember, installing high-quality locks isn&#8217;t just about keeping intruders out &#8211; it&#8217;s about providing peace of mind for everyone living there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-use-smart-technology">2. Use Smart Technology</h3>



<p>Integrating smart technology into your sharehouse can enhance security. Smart cameras and alarm systems allow you to monitor the property remotely through your phone. <a href="https://soundhub.io/blog/different-types-of-speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart speakers</a> can also be incorporated to control other smart home devices and improve the living experience. This ensures you can keep an eye on things at all times, providing added peace of mind.</p>



<p>Motion sensor lights around entry points can also deter potential intruders by making it hard for them to approach unnoticed. Features such as keyless entry systems and smart locks offer convenient ways to secure the house without worrying about&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/guide-to-different-types-of-apartment-keys/" class="broken_link">lost keys</a>. Implementing these technologies creates a safer, more controllable environment for everyone in the sharehouse.&nbsp;If you’re looking for a comprehensive smart home system, check out Cybernews <a href="https://cybernews.com/best-home-security-systems/vivint-review/" class="broken_link">review of Vivint</a>, one of the top-rated options for intelligent security solutions.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:100%"></div>
</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-organize-regular-meetings">3. Organize Regular Meetings</h3>



<p>Regular meetings with your housemates can be vital for maintaining a secure, shared living space. These gatherings offer an opportunity to discuss any security concerns or <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/3-expert-tips-protect-info-snooping-roommate/" class="broken_link">unusual activities</a> noticed around the property. Open communication helps ensure everyone is aware of potential risks and contributes to a collective sense of vigilance and responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During these meetings, you can establish house rules, such as always locking doors and windows when leaving the house, or not letting strangers in without informing others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussing emergency plans ensures everyone knows what to do in case of an incident. Consistent dialogue fosters teamwork and makes it easier to address any issues promptly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-pay-close-attention-to-windows-and-doors">4. Pay Close Attention to Windows and Doors</h3>



<p>Windows and doors are the most common entry points for intruders, so it&#8217;s vital to ensure they are secure. Start by installing sturdy locks on all windows and doors and make it a habit to lock them every time you leave the house or go to bed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider adding extra security features like sliding door jammers or window bars for added peace of mind. Regularly check for any signs of wear and tear, such as loose frames or broken latches, and address these issues promptly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simple measures like keeping windows locked when not in use can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized entry, making your sharehouse a safer place for everyone living there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-secure-valuables">5. Secure Valuables</h3>



<p>In a shared living environment, it&#8217;s crucial to take extra precautions in <a href="https://reolink.com/blog/where-to-store-valuables/">securing your personal belongings</a>. Utilize lockable storage units or safes within your room to keep valuable items like jewelry, electronics, and important documents protected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This not only prevents theft from housemates but also adds a layer of security in case someone breaks into the house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Always avoid leaving expensive items in common areas where they are more vulnerable. You might also consider labeling your personal items to deter any potential mix-ups or misunderstandings. Ultimately, securing your valuables ensures peace of mind and contributes to an overall sense of safety within the sharehouse.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-create-emergency-plans">6. Create Emergency Plans</h3>



<p>Creating well-thought-out emergency plans is essential for keeping everyone in your sharehouse safe. Start by establishing clear procedures for different situations, such as fires, break-ins, or medical emergencies. Make sure all housemates know where emergency exits are located and how to use fire extinguishers if necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s helpful to designate specific meeting spots outside the house in case evacuation becomes necessary. Regularly review and practice these plans so everyone feels confident about what to do when an incident occurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Establishing a shared contact list with important numbers, like local emergency services, adds another layer of preparedness. Proactive planning can make all the difference in managing crises effectively and calmly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-keep-entryways-well-lit">7. Keep Entryways Well-Lit</h3>



<p>Ensuring your entryways are well-lit is a simple yet effective way to boost the security of your sharehouse. Bright outdoor lighting reduces hiding spots for would-be intruders and makes it easier for you and your housemates to see who&#8217;s approaching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Install lights at all main entrances, including front, back, and side doors. Motion sensor lights are an excellent option because they turn on automatically when someone gets close, saving energy while still providing protection.</p>



<p>Also, consider smart lighting systems that allow you to control the lights remotely. This way, you can keep entryways lit even if you&#8217;re not home. A bright, well-lit entrance acts as a deterrent and provides peace of mind.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-know-your-housemates-guests">8. Know Your Housemates’ Guests</h3>



<p>Knowing who your housemates are inviting over plays a significant role in maintaining your sharehouse’s security. It’s crucial to foster open communication about guests, as it ensures that everyone in the household is aware of who should and shouldn’t be inside the home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Establishing guidelines for informing each other about expected visitors helps prevent any surprises. Plus, recognizing unfamiliar faces or identifying friends of your housemates makes it easier to spot potential intruders. This collective awareness fosters a more secure environment.</p>



<p>&nbsp;By staying informed and understanding each other&#8217;s social circles, you contribute to a trusting atmosphere where every resident can feel safe and comfortable.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-get-to-know-your-neighbors-nbsp">9. Get to Know Your Neighbors&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Building a relationship with your neighbors is an underrated yet crucial aspect of home security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you know the people living around you, it creates a sense of community and mutual responsibility. Friendly neighbors are more likely to keep an eye out for unusual activity and can alert you if they notice anything suspicious.</p>



<p>Take the time to introduce yourself and engage in casual conversations now and then. Establishing this rapport means you can count on them to pick up your mail when you&#8217;re away or potentially even check on the house. Fostering these connections transforms strangers into unofficial guardians of your shared space, enhancing overall safety for everyone involved.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-conduct-regular-maintenance-nbsp">10. Conduct Regular Maintenance&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Regular maintenance is key to ensuring the security measures in your sharehouse remain effective. Over time, locks can wear down, security systems can become outdated, and small issues can escalate if not addressed promptly. Make it a habit to routinely check all entry points, including doors and windows, for any signs of damage or tampering.</p>



<p>Test your alarm systems and security cameras periodically to ensure they are functioning correctly. Don&#8217;t forget about outdoor areas; trim back any overgrown bushes or trees that could serve as hiding spots for intruders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staying on top of these tasks not only maintains the safety of your home but also helps prevent costly repairs down the line.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-how-you-secure-a-shared-space">This is How You Secure a Shared Space</h2>



<p>Securing your shared house is not just about protecting physical property &#8211; it&#8217;s about creating a space where everyone can feel safe and comfortable. By implementing these strategies, you cultivate a secure environment that benefits all housemates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t wait until something happens to take action; start making these changes today. Discuss these tips with your housemates, invest in the necessary tools, and stay vigilant together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your shared home should be a sanctuary for everyone living there, and taking these simple steps can make a significant difference. Peace of mind begins with proactive measures!</p>

<p>When it comes to living with an international roommate, the experience is like a coin with two sides—each with its own set of perks and challenges.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s chat about what makes this journey so special, and what bumps you might find along the way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pros</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cultural enrichment:</strong> Imagine celebrating Diwali, Christmas, and Chinese New Year all in one apartment! Living with someone from a different culture turns your home into a mini global village. You get a firsthand look at traditions, foods, and daily practices that books or documentaries can barely do justice to.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Language practice:</strong> Ever wanted to learn Spanish, French, or Mandarin but found classes too dull or expensive? Well, if your roommate speaks a different language, it’s a great opportunity to practice or learn a new language. It&#8217;s much more engaging and fun to learn by conversing daily than through books or apps alone</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Expanding your perspectives:</strong> Discussing world events with someone from another country can open your eyes to different perspectives. It encourages open-mindedness and can challenge preconceived notions you might have about other cultures.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>New friends and connections:</strong>: Having a foreign roommate often means they might have friends from other countries too. This can expand your social circle and introduce you to a diverse group of people you might not have met otherwise. It can be particularly valuable if you’re looking into working or studying abroad.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cons</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Different daily routines:</strong> Your idea of early might be their idea of a sleep-in. Maybe your roommate comes from a culture where dinner at 10 PM is the norm, while you’re used to eating by 6 PM. These differences in daily routines can be quirky at first, but frustrating if not navigated carefully.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Communication hiccups:</strong> Even if you both speak the same language, certain nuances and expressions can lead to misunderstandings. Sometimes, what’s considered a harmless joke in one culture can be a rude remark in another. It’s all about navigating these nuances with care and a good dose of humor.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Privacy issues:</strong> In some cultures, it’s normal to enter someone’s room without knocking, while in others, such privacy invasions could lead to World War III in the apartment! Setting clear boundaries that respect both your privacy is key.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Household habits:</strong> Cultural differences can extend to everyday habits and lifestyles, from cleaning standards to cooking smells, noise levels, and even the way you spend your leisure time. What’s normal in one culture (like leaving dishes overnight) might be a no-go in another. This might require adjustments and compromises that not everyone is comfortable with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, here are some practical tips to help you navigate the rewarding yet complex dynamics of living with someone from a different cultural background.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Explore with your international roommate</h3>



<p>A new city or country often means new stores and chains you don’t recognize. For your international roommate, it could be quite a culture shock.</p>



<p>Take time to get to know the city together. Find a favorite grocery store, try a couple of happy hours, and just explore the neighborhood with your roommate even if you aren’t best friends (yet).</p>



<p>After you’re done raiding the local farmer’s market, schedule a night to&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/roommate-bonding-activities/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">try cooking a new dish</a>&nbsp;—maybe you’ll discover a new favorite you’ve never heard of before!</p>



<p>Trust us — while it seems like a small gesture, it will help your new roommate feel at home.</p>



<p>This goes both ways, though! They might have some killer recs for you too. Never tried Ethiopian food? Who better to show you exactly how to eat that spongy bread than a local?</p>



<p>And if you and your international roommate have any sort of language barrier, just remember: Food is the universal language.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Share cultural norms</h3>



<p>When it comes to sharing stuff, it’s always&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">best to ask</a>&nbsp;— whether it’s food or toiletries, don’t just assume it’s yours to use.</p>



<p>Hopefully, you’re doing that anyway, but sharing habits aren’t always so common sense. Americans, for example, might be more casual about “borrowing” something than someone from abroad.</p>



<p>Wherever you stand on the sharing thing, it’s best to talk about it early on to avoid any misunderstandings on either of your part. The last thing you want is to sour your relationship with your international roommate over some grapes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Be&nbsp;crystal clear about what’s ‘included’</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s super important to be transparent about what&#8217;s included in your living arrangement.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t just about the rent and bills—though those are key—it&#8217;s about all the little (and not so little) things that can cause misunderstandings if they&#8217;re not spelled out from the get-go.</p>



<p>For example, let&#8217;s talk about the basics like utilities. Are all utilities included in the rent, or will you and your roommate be splitting the costs of things like electricity, water, and internet? This should be laid out clearly to avoid any surprises when the bills start rolling in.</p>



<p>But beyond the financials, you should also discuss what living essentials are shared and what aren&#8217;t. Will you be sharing food, or is everyone on their own for meals?</p>



<p>What about cleaning supplies or bathroom essentials like toilet paper—will these be communal expenses, or is everyone expected to pitch in separately?</p>



<p>And here&#8217;s one that often gets overlooked: space usage. Be clear about which areas are communal and which are private. Can you both use the living room for hanging out or hosting friends? Who gets which shelves in the fridge?</p>



<p>These might seem like small details, but they can lead to big headaches if they&#8217;re not hashed out upfront.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Use a good app</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re moving to a new country and need some navigating the rental landscape, having the right tools can make all the difference.</p>



<p>This is where a reliable international roommate finder like <a href="https://roomiapp.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Roomi</a> steps in. Roomi isn’t just another platform to find a place to live; it connects you to a vibrant community of renters who are actively looking to share their living spaces.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don’t assume anything</h3>



<p>Assumptions can be the quickest route to misunderstandings. When you live with someone from a different cultural background, try to avoid jumping to conclusions based on your cultural norms.</p>



<p>For example, if your roommate doesn’t share much about their personal life, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re unfriendly. Some cultures value privacy and might take longer to open up.</p>



<p>Always ask and communicate instead of assuming; this will help you avoid many potential conflicts and help you understand your roommate’s actions and responses better.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Make intros</h3>



<p>Hopefully, you and your new international roommate can find some common ground to let a friendship bloom.</p>



<p>But even if you’re not the best of buds, you might be able to introduce them to their next BFF — making you Roommate of the Year!</p>



<p>So get on your Facebook/Instagram/X (or any other social media platform you use) and make some intros. It&#8217;ll be the easiest thing you can do with the largest payoff.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Avoid using stereotypes</h3>



<p>It’s also important for you to recognize and avoid relying on stereotypes when interacting with your international roommate.</p>



<p>It’s way better to get to know your roommate as a person. Ask them about their interests, their family, what a typical day looked like for them back home, or their favorite music.</p>



<p>You’ll likely find that they’re much more than any stereotype could cover. Plus, this kind of open curiosity may help you build a more genuine and respectful relationship.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve moved in with your new roommate, and things are mostly going great. But then, little things start popping up—maybe it&#8217;s dishes left in the sink longer than you&#8217;d like, or the bathroom becomes a free-for-all during your morning routine.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to think, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll just let it slide this time,&#8221; but those little annoyances can quickly snowball into major irritations if they aren&#8217;t addressed.</p>



<p>The trick here is to bring up issues while they&#8217;re still small. You might worry about coming off as naggy, but it&#8217;s really about keeping your shared space comfortable for everyone.</p>



<p>If you notice something, say something (in a polite way, of course.) Your roommate might not even realize they&#8217;re doing something that bugs you. People have different living habits, and what’s obvious to you might not be to someone else.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Be patient</h3>



<p>Living with a foreign roommate may test your patience in all sorts of ways. Think about it: each of us grows up with our own set of norms, and it can take a minute to adjust when someone else’s norms crash into ours.</p>



<p>However, showing a bit of patience can make things much easier. It allows everyone some breathing room to adjust and find common ground. Remember — just like you’re adapting to their quirks, they’re adjusting to yours.</p>



<p>Showing patience gives you time to understand and respect your roommate&#8217;s needs and preferences and vice versa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>And there you have it! Living with an international roommate goes beyond just sharing a space—it&#8217;s about sharing experiences, learning from each other, and growing together in unexpected ways.</p>



<p>With these tips in your back pocket, you&#8217;re all set to make the most of this unique living arrangement.</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>The popularity of coliving has risen rapidly over the last few years. Coliving, in a nutshell, is when you share a living space with other people with shared interests.</p>



<p>There are multiple reasons why people choose coliving. It could be to combat loneliness, to build a professional network, or just to be part of a community. One of the prime reasons someone may choose coliving, however, is to cut down on rent and other living costs.</p>



<p>In a bustling city like San Francisco, for some, the rent costs can seem too high. If you also add the cost of utilities and food, there isn’t a lot of room left for other activities.</p>

<p>The minimum stay period ranges between 30 to 90 days, with the option to extend. There&#8217;s also usually a great Wi-Fi connection, among several other benefits.</p>

<p>Did you know that almost <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/31/more-adults-now-share-their-living-space-driven-in-part-by-parents-living-with-their-adult-children/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-third of US adults</a> are living with a roommate? Co-living has become a sustainable choice for many as the cost of living increases in cities.</p>



<p>But as it turns out, not all of them are having a great experience. There are many factors that affect your relationship with roommates and once in a while, some roommates just don’t pan out so well. Living with a roommate demands you to share resources and get along with different people. Not exactly a piece of cake for everyone!</p>

<p>Finding &#8220;the one&#8221; to share your home with can be quite an adventure.&nbsp; <strong>Here’s a practical guide by Roomi on living with a roommate. This blog covers everything from how to find a good roommate to how you can work out a great relationship with them.</strong></p>

<p>Living alone is difficult. Period! It’s not just the rent or doing every chore yourself; living alone can get lonely from time to time. Living with a roommate could solve these problems &#8211; and more!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-saves-you-a-big-chunk-of-rent-and-housing-resources-"><strong>Saves you a big chunk of rent and housing resources</strong></h3>



<p>This is the biggest reason why most young adults start living with a roommate. Imagine how much you could do with the money saved on lower rent- not to mention electricity bills and other utility expenses!</p>

<p>Staying in an apartment comes with a ton of responsibilities, and it&#8217;s a relief to share the load with someone. Having one person to vacuum the floors while you clean the kitchen can save so much time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-expand-your-social-circle-"><strong>Expand your social circle</strong></h3>



<p>If you enjoy meeting new people, living with a roommate could be perfect for you. You can find a new network of friends and have some amazing experiences to cherish.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-benefits-of-living-with-roommates-vs-living-alone/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pros of having a roommate rather than living alone</a>. But it&#8217;s important to know the ins and outs of cohabitating with someone before you sign a lease together. Many people jump into roommate situations without knowing what they&#8217;re getting into, which can lead to problems later on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-how-to-find-amazing-roommates-"><strong>How to Find Amazing Roommates</strong></h2>



<p>Living with a roommate is all about trusting a stranger. Sounds unnerving, right? To put your faith in someone you barely know! But if you start off in the right direction, the pay-off is worth it. Trust us!</p>



<p><strong>Online tools and communities are a great way to begin the hunt for the perfect roommate. Roomi is one of the best roommate finder apps out there.</strong> You can get in touch with people who need roommates near you and talk to them before the meeting. It is a safe and secure platform to connect with like-minded individuals coming from similar backgrounds.</p>

<p>Start off with clear communication before living with a roommate to catch any red flags. Of course, you won’t be able to get all the details in the first meeting. There is always scope for surprises down the line, but hopefully, they&#8217;re not all bad!</p>

<p>When living with a roommate, it can be easy for us to set unforgiving standards for others. Don&#8217;t forget that you&#8217;re not perfect either (although you might disagree!) and reflect on your own actions before playing the blame game.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-2-dealing-with-common-roommate-problems">2. Dealing with Common Roommate Problems</h3>



<p>What are some of the most common roommate conflicts that arise when you&#8217;re living with a roommate?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Sharing spaces like the living room, kitchen, and bathroom</li>



<li>Sharing the WiFi</li>



<li>Splitting bills</li>



<li>Cleaning common spaces</li>



<li>Running errands</li>



<li>Invading private space</li>



<li>Too many people in the house <strong>(What to do if your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deal-roommates-significant-never-leaves/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate&#8217;s significant other won&#8217;t leave</a>!)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The intensity of the problems can vary depending on how you react to them. Having some ground rules can help to a great extent but you must also be careful of some small loopholes.</p>

<p>For example, you&#8217;ve made a cleaning schedule for everyone to follow, and everyone has agreed. The next day you wake up and find the kitchen sink full of dishes that you didn’t use. You knock on the door of your roommate and it’s empty. They are already out for the day. ?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It can make you feel mad. Maybe you wait all day to confront your roommate, with those dirty dishes in your eyesight, and later you argue about it. But is that really going to help?</p>



<p>The best way is to calm down and assume that maybe your roommate had something urgent that made them skip the chore. Ask them about it and try to understand their reasons. Once you have listened, you can tell them how it was difficult for you to manage your breakfast on time because they didn’t do the dishes.</p>

<p>Whether you are inviting a new roommate in or already living with a roommate, there are always a few expectations &#8211; the “ground rules”, as we like to call them. You&#8217;re expected to clean your own dishes and empty the garbage when it gets full, for example. Not everyone is as lucky as Rachel to have Monica do all the cleaning!</p>

<p>Basic roommate etiquette is essential for everyone to follow. It&#8217;s what stops people barging into other bedrooms, or tucking into their roommates&#8217; food, for a start!</p>



<p>Setting house rules for roommates is no easy task. Begin with regular house meetings to get everyone on the same page regarding chores and errands. Divide the daily and weekly tasks for everyone to follow. Go together for tasks like buying groceries; you might find it&#8217;s a fun, bonding activity!</p>

Some rules may even vanish. Be open to evolving and changing them, and make sure to communicate your issues freely.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Living with a roommate demands you to become an adult, and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-manage-finances-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">managing finances</a> is paramount. Splitting the rent and paying utility bills on time is important for everyone in the house. However, if your roommate has a genuine reason to not pay the rent on time- it’s okay! Financial situations may go up and down once in a while for everyone. It’s okay to wait a day or two if your roommate is not able to pay the bills, but you can send them a gentle reminder to let them know that it’s rent day. ?</p>



<p>Splitting bills with roommates can get even more complicated when you make lots of shared purchases. Grabbing margaritas at the weekend, ordering pizza for dinner, or buying furniture for the home? All too often, one person fronts the bill and the others take far too long to pay it back.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-5-setting-boundaries-in-between-all-the-sharing">5. Setting Boundaries in Between all the Sharing</h3>



<p>Living with a roommate is all about learning to share while maintaining boundaries. You share a small space including the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. Check out some <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sharing-a-closet-with-spouse-organization-ideas/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ideas for sharing a closet.</a></p>

<p>Have a clear discussion on which groceries can be shared and what is off-limits. And if you are a Joey who doesn’t share food, it’s okay to let your roommate know. Just remember: that also means you can&#8217;t help yourself to their snacks&#8230; no matter how good they may look!</p>

<p><strong>Boundaries especially come into play when you talk about privacy</strong>. The bedroom is probably the only place that is completely private, so always ask permission before entering. If you share a bedroom, you must respect their personal belongings.</p>



<p>Despite this, sometimes we forget where the lines are. Say, for example, your laptop suddenly stops working one day and you decide to work on your roommate’s laptop. <strong>And what about <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sharing-wifi-with-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing wifi with roommates</a>?</strong></p>

<p>It seems <em>natural</em> to hack resources but this is a strict no-no. Ask politely to avoid any dramatic run-ins. If your roommate isn&#8217;t comfortable sharing their stuff, respect that and move on.</p>



<p><strong>Taking it to the emotional level, relationships that involve regular interaction require boundaries.</strong> When you are living with a roommate, you need to understand when you can be great buddies and when you need to give them some space.</p>

<p>Not all roommates want to share their personal problems and there are a couple of things that might surface when living together. You may have an <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-expert-tips-co-living-introvert-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">introverted roommate</a> who doesn&#8217;t want to go into every detail about their life. Aim to be a friend when they need you, but always make sure to respect their boundaries.</p>



<p>On the other hand, living with an <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-expert-tips-co-living-extrovert-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">extroverted roommate</a> could require you to set your boundaries clearly. If you find yourself living with a roommate that constantly wants to socialize, make sure you&#8217;re on the same page so you can enjoy some alone time, too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-6-fun-activities-should-be-part-of-the-daily-chores">6. Fun Activities Should be Part of the Daily Chores</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;re crystal clear about the boundaries, there is so much freedom to enjoy when living with a roommate. You could arrange a fun outing once a week or invite friends over for a house party on special occasions. But beyond that, you must also have the time in your daily routine to talk and chill out.</p>



<p>People who spend time with their roommates every day have a greater chance of having a satisfactory roommate relationship. Simple acts like going out for a morning walk together can help you get along better.</p>



<p>Doing chores with roomies makes the dreaded deep-clean more fun. Once a month, why not plan a &#8220;family dinner&#8221;, where you all go shopping and cook a feast together? <strong>There are plenty of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-bonding-activities/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate bonding activities</a> to look forward to when you are living with a roommate.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-7-let%E2%80%99s-talk-about-pets">7. Let’s Talk About Pets</h3>



<p>This one is a bonus for anyone dealing with a roommate&#8217;s pets or those with a pet of their own. Pets are just like roommates &#8211; except that they are animals and they don’t pay rent!&nbsp;Pets are the responsibility of their owners, but when you have <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/deal-roommates-untrained-pet/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommates and pets</a> living together, there’s a lot to keep in mind!</p>

<p>As a pet owner living with a roommate, you&#8217;ll need to make sure everyone else in the house is cool with your furry friend. Let them know from the outset that you come as a package. And don&#8217;t expect your roommates to take care of them &#8211; the grooming, feeding, and cleaning are down to you.</p>



<p><strong>On the other hand, if you are living with a roommate who has a pet, you must let them know if there are any issues.</strong> Whether the dog is barking at night, or the house is becoming less hygienic, point this out to the pet owner. They should take responsibility for this.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="14-peace-resolution-101-"><strong>Peace Resolution 101</strong></h2>



<p>So, you have made the house chore chart, you are clear with your boundaries, and have happily agreed to deal with the pet situation. That’s a lot of healthy compromises and yet one fine day, it could all fall down and there could be a dramatic fight that you can’t avoid. Boom!</p>

<p>It’s alright to feel disappointed and not talk for a while. Let the dust settle down and perhaps, the intensity will fade away. <strong>Never hold a grudge due to any <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/first-hand-advice-avoiding-political-drama-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">political drama with roommates</a>.</strong> Everyone has different opinions based on unique experiences, and often it&#8217;s best to agree to disagree.</p>

Listen with an open mind, react rationally, and keep the communication flowing when living with a roommate. Just because something your roommate has done has hurt you doesn’t mean that you should cut contact. It will just create tension &#8211; something you definitely <em>don&#8217;t</em> want at home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving out and living in an apartment can be a liberating experience. You&#8217;re finally out of your parents&#8217; hair, plus you get to stay in the city you&#8217;ve always dreamed about. But there&#8217;s a downside to your newfound freedom. And that&#8217;s using shared living spaces in the property. Part of the reality of being a renter is using a communal kitchen and sharing a bathroom.</p>



<p>Showering and grooming can be a hellish experience depending on your roomis. If you live with slobs, you&#8217;re probably all too familiar with the sight of hair stuck in the drain. Or that mildew building up on the shower curtains. If you&#8217;re the unhygienic roommate, it&#8217;s time to get your act together so you don&#8217;t gross your fellow renters out. Living in an apartment, after all, is all about respecting other people&#8217;s need for clean and safe spaces.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there are ways to make any shared bathroom a welcoming spot for everyone. Here are some handy hacks to get you started.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-come-up-with-a-schedule-for-using-cleaning-the-bathroom"><strong>1. Come up with a schedule for using &amp; cleaning the bathroom.</strong></h2>

<p></p>



<p>It can be chaotic when everyone&#8217;s scrambling to use the bathroom at the same time each day. When the entire apartment needs to get ready for work or school, your shower schedules are sure to clash.</p>



<p>This problem can easily be solved by coming up with a pre-agreed shower schedule. Set a time for every person to shower and apply a time limit, so no one hogs the bathroom.</p>



<p>When sharing a bathroom, it&#8217;s also important that everyone pitches in to keep it as spotless and germ-free as possible. This is where a cleaning schedule comes in. Take turns cleaning the bathroom at least once a week, using a checklist to make sure all surfaces are properly sanitized. Don&#8217;t skip the jobs everyone hates, here!</p>

<p></p>



<p>On top of the weekly cleaning schedule, it&#8217;s good manners to clean up after using the bathroom. With any shared living spaces, simple acts like wiping surfaces dry go a long way to keeping the area fresh. Store multipurpose spray or wipes under the cabinet, so no one has an excuse not to clean as they go! Some simple maintenance after you shower helps to keep mold and hard water build-up at bay.</p>



<p>Sharing a bathroom also means not leaving any traces of hair behind. For the gentlemen, try using a grooming mat to catch all your mustache and beard trimmings every time you shave. This is a non-slip material you place on top of the sink while you get rid of that five o&#8217;clock shadow. Just dust the hair into a trashcan and you&#8217;re done with cleanup.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Since you&#8217;re sharing a bathroom with roommates, you want to be extra mindful about how much time you spend there. It&#8217;s primarily meant, after all, for essentials like showering and doing your business on the toilet. Consider doing your grooming activities like styling your hair, putting on makeup, and checking out your outfit in your room. Invest in a vanity or full-length mirror so you can carry out your beauty routine there instead of in the shared bathroom.</p>

<p>Sharing a bathroom with roommates can get pretty messy, especially if everyone leaves their body washes, shampoo bottles and toothbrushes lying around. One trick is to buy a shower caddy &#8211; those plastic baskets that hold your stuff. Every time you shower, just bring it with your things inside so they don&#8217;t get mixed in with everyone else&#8217;s.</p>



<p>If the entire home has a caddy, simply hang them up with wall adhesives and label them with names. Now everyone has a place to store their shower essentials.</p>

<p>With shared living spaces, there&#8217;s a big chance that you and your roommates use a lot of the same products &#8211; from shaving gel to hairdryers. Make the most of the space under the sink to store these shared items and make them accessible.</p>



<p>You can find a lot of organizing bins and baskets on Amazon to store things like a pro. Label them with individual names or just write &#8220;everyone&#8221; on the items you&#8217;re happy to share. You can also hang hooks over the door for towels, so you don&#8217;t have to step over wet, dirty towels when sharing a bathroom.</p>

<p>When sharing a bathroom, no one wants to use one that smells disgusting. It&#8217;s particularly awkward and embarrassing if you leave it stinky and a roommate needs to use it right after you.</p>



<p>Scents can do a lot to make using the area more pleasant. Lighting a scented candle, using an aromatic diffuser, or just spritzing a room spray can instantly uplift the bathroom&#8217;s vibe. Try leaving a bag of potpourri to perfume the bathroom. Every time you do number two, you can also use poo sprays to mask those unwanted odors.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Nobody wants to keep sharing a bathroom with roommates that&#8217;s dirty, smelly, and cluttered. But at the end of the day, not everyone is a germophobe or a neat freak. While everyone can agree on rules and responsibilities, there&#8217;s always someone bound to mess up every now and then. Remember to take it easy and don&#8217;t get mad if someone forgets to leave out a fresh roll of toilet paper.</p>

<p></p>



<p>An apartment co-signer is someone included on a lease agreement who is held responsible for paying the rent in full, if the tenant is unable to do so. They&#8217;re obligated to help you financially in terms of your rent instead of placing you in debt with your landlord. The co-signer can either be someone who lives in the residence or is a separate party, such as a parent or guardian.</p>



<p>Usually, tenants get apartment co-signers if their credit scores are too low to be approved, have no stable income, or are unemployed. With a co-signer, the tenant is showing the landlord that they have credible financial backing to pay for the property.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-co-signing-for-a-lease-work">How does co-signing for a lease work?</h3>



<p>Renting an apartment comes with qualifications, much like applying for a job. Normally, you&#8217;d need to have an income that&#8217;s enough to cover rental, food, and transportation expenses, plus an adequate credit score and history. If you&#8217;re a student who hasn&#8217;t built up credit, or you don&#8217;t have a good credit history, having a co-signer will help you get an apartment more easily. Once you find an apartment co-signer and the landlord approves, the lease will be signed with the co-signer&#8217;s name, and you now have an apartment!</p>



<p>Alternatively, suppose you&#8217;re co-signing for an apartment. In that case, you&#8217;d be responsible for paying the monthly rent, any property damage, repair costs, and other fees, should the tenant fail to pay these debts. Basically, the responsibility for the payment would fall to the co-signer and not paying will affect their credit score and history.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>How does a co-signer help someone actually get an apartment?</strong> When you ask a co-signer to sign onto an apartment lease, you&#8217;re lowering your risk as a bad credit borrower. This is because the co-signer promises to pay any rental payments if you&#8217;re unable to. Plus, a co-signer also helps you by attaching their good credit score and history to your lease.</li>



<li><strong>How does the process work when the rent is missed?</strong> If the person you co-signed for fails to pay, you&#8217;re legally obligated to make up for the missed payment. With your name on the lease, you face the consequences of failed payments or loan defaults.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-and-cons-of-having-and-being-an-apartment-co-signer">Pros and Cons of having and being an Apartment Co-signer</h3>



<p>Deciding on having or being an apartment co-signer isn&#8217;t a decision you can make overnight. Co-signing isn&#8217;t just a verbal agreement between everyone involved nor a mere vote of confidence in the borrower. For the tenant, having a co-signer is ensuring that you won&#8217;t break their trust on any financial payment of the property. And as a co-signer, you&#8217;re promising to settle should the tenant fail to pay.</p>



<p>With that, here&#8217;s a short list of the pros and cons of co-signing.</p>



<p><strong>For tenants:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The process of renting an apartment is much smoother with a co-signer because of their good credit score and history.</li>



<li>You&#8217;d be approved even as a first-time renter with a low credit score or an eviction history.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Having a close friend or family member as an apartment co-signer may damage your relationship with them if you can&#8217;t pay.</li>



<li>Your co-signer may take over your lease entirely.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>For apartment co-signers:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Co-signing for a friend or your child builds trust in your relationship. More so, it promotes independence and can help your child transition to adulthood.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Being responsible for all of the rent for the apartment, if the tenant fails to pay, can be a huge financial burden.</li>



<li>As an apartment co-signer, if the tenant gets evicted for any reason, your credit score may be negatively affected since your name is on the lease.</li>
</ul>

<p>Co-signing for a lease is serious business. Most of the time, a close friend, relative, or parent is the usual pick since they&#8217;re the people who already know and trust you. But you have to remember that renting an apartment is costly, so there are many things to consider before co-signing an apartment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="apartment-co-signer-requirements">Apartment Co-signer Requirements</h3>



<p>As an apartment co-signer, almost everything boils down to money. Since you&#8217;re responsible for all financial matters regarding the property, landlords generally look at your income and credit score before giving their approval. However, there isn&#8217;t a definite criterion on who can be an apartment co-signer, so anyone who meets the landlord&#8217;s qualifications can be one. Requirements usually include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>High credit score</li>



<li>Good mortgage or rental history</li>



<li>An established employment record</li>



<li>Sufficient income</li>
</ul>



<p>Co-signing for an apartment is a serious responsibility that shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly. If you&#8217;re looking for an apartment co-signer, make sure they meet these criteria to be approved for an apartment quickly.</p>

<p>Having an apartment co-signer will be a massive help while looking for a place to stay. But, you can&#8217;t rely on your co-signer to pay for everything! Remember, they will only step in if you run into financial problems and fail to pay your dues. Nonetheless, if you stay responsible and diligent with your payments, your apartment co-signer will never have to interact with your landlord.</p>

<p>In chilly winters, the fireplace becomes the central source of warmth and joy. And above the fireplace is the mantel, which should become the focal point of your small apartment. This is where your guests can gather to chat and sit around the fire. Add your favorite Christmas objects over the mantel, such as pine cones and stockings. Also, hang up elegantly framed pictures that evoke memories of Christmas past.</p>

<p>Why invest in a heavy, bulky Christmas tree when you can display smaller and cuter alternatives? Get a mini Christmas tree or use a branch of a full-size one. You can also opt for another potted plant or adorable micro trees. These are some of the best Christmas tree ideas for a small apartment. Downsizing your Christmas tree can save you a bunch of space in your apartment that can be used to arrange a seating area. Having some clear space makes the it feel larger and more organized.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-work-with-a-theme">4. Work with a theme</h3>



<p>Having a theme can work wonders for your small apartment Christmas decor. You can opt for a color scheme like black and white. Or you can be more specific with a motif of floral decorations or a fairytale setting. A vintage theme can work wonderfully to create a nostalgic and comforting space. Themes of a frozen wonderland or a mountain lodge can also work beautifully to get the best out of your small apartment.</p>

<p>For your small apartment Christmas decor, get some fresh bouquets or a new seasonal plant. Poinsettias are known to be a classic choice but you can also get orchids and cyclamens. Add some fir and pine cones for a wintry look. Dry flowers or winter bouquets with candy canes add the perfect amount of whimsy to your space.</p>

<p>Glam up your doors to add to your small apartment Christmas decor. You can hang a bell on the doorknob so that everyone greets with a holiday jingle. Hang some flowers or some pine branches with a cute bow. Or you may just stick a basket and add some pretty little things like pine cones or fresh poinsettias.</p>



<p>Make a unique wreath for your front door. If you have a theme for Christmas decor, you can design your wreath to match. For example, for a vintage theme, you can make a wreath of dry, old flowers with some fairy lights. You can stick several <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Making-Mini-Christmas-Wreaths/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">mini wreaths</a> on your door as well.</p>

<p>The kitchen is an important part of your apartment, so why leave it out of the celebration? It will most likely already be brewing with fragrances that will attract your guests. Make it visually appealing as well with cute bows and mini wreaths on the cupboard.</p>



<p>Get a mini Christmas tree or some pine cones to add to the charm. But make sure not to over-clutter the counter space. Your decorations should not prevent you from cooking in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Did you know one of the most common reasons for clashes among couples is because of sharing a closet? Fighting over a disorganized closet, closet clutter, and not being able to find items are the most common causes of arguments between couples when it comes to sharing a closet. But you don&#8217;t need to go through all these ordeals like other couples. Try these 11 closet organization ideas and create a more harmonious space with your significant other!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-declutter">1. Declutter</h3>



<p>Unless you&#8217;re moving to a mansion with a shared walk-in closet, you need to manage with small closet space. Before organizing it, sort and segregate your belongings and review each of the items carefully. Ask yourself these three questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Have you worn it recently?</li>



<li>Does it fit?</li>



<li>Will you need it in the future?</li>
</ul>



<p>If your response is a no to all three questions, it is time to discard or donate the item. Make it a habit and repeat this exercise every season.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-work-with-your-partner-if-you-re-sharing-a-closet">2. Work with your partner if you&#8217;re sharing a closet</h3>



<p>Organizing a shared closet takes teamwork. Many couples prefer to split their closet space 50/50 but you don&#8217;t need to follow the same rule if you don&#8217;t want to. Instead, discuss your work time, morning routine, and habits to organize your closet. The purpose here is to not get into each other&#8217;s way while getting ready for the day.</p>



<p>For example, if both of you need to get ready for work at the same time, it makes sense to organize your stuff on two sides of the closet. But if you don&#8217;t need to access the closet simultaneously, you can share the drawer or the hanging rods without getting into each other&#8217;s way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-store-off-season-items-separately">3. Store off-season items separately</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re sharing a small closet with spouse, use your closet space to store everyday work clothes, accessories, shoes, etc. Store all the off-season clothes like leather jackets, skirts, heavy woolens, etc., in separate storage boxes. Place them under your bed or any other corner of the room.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-label-storage">4. Label storage</h3>



<p>Storage boxes come in handy when sharing a closet. They can make up for drawers if you don&#8217;t have too many drawer spaces. Keep separate storage boxes for shoes, hats, innerwear, belts, etc. Label them or color-code them so that you don&#8217;t need to scramble through everything when getting ready.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-hire-a-professional">5. Hire a professional</h3>



<p>When you&#8217;re sharing a closet and your closet space is premium, hire a professional designer to maximize space utilization. A professional can help you customize the closet space by adding a shelf here or a cubby there, adding long and short rods, or shoe racks. Additionally, you can include a specialized storage accessory on your side of the closet, like a belt rack on one side and a jewelry drawer organizer on the other.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-consider-double-hanging">6. Consider double hanging</h3>



<p>Every closet can have enough space if you know how to use it cleverly. Couples sharing a closet often prefer double hanging because it&#8217;s the least expensive way to maximize closet space. What&#8217;s cool is with double hanging, you can store two times the shirts, blouses, and pants in the same vertical space.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-choose-velvet-hangers-over-wooden-or-plastic-hangers">7. Choose velvet hangers over wooden or plastic hangers</h3>



<p>Get rid of your chunky wooden and plastic hangers that chew up space and look ugly. Replace them with cohesive hangers. Velvet hangers especially look nice. They are sturdy, add space, and make your closet look much cleaner.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-maintain-your-shared-closet">8. Maintain your shared closet</h3>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re splitting your closet 50/50 or 70/30, you need to keep your closet organized for it to remain functional. Maintain some checks and balances to keep it clean and clutter-free. Like, whenever you take something out of the closet, put it back in the same place. And once a year, take time off from your regular schedule to do an annual decluttering of the closest to keep things organized.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-use-additional-storage">9. Use additional storage</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re still running out of closet space, consider using under-the-bed storage to store what you only occasionally need. Another idea is to utilize your wall—place hooks to hang your daily wears, belts, ties, and necklaces. Just remember to keep it neat and don&#8217;t dump everything on the hook. You can use creative racks on your bedroom wall where you can keep your accessories neatly arranged.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-practice-the-one-in-one-out-rule">10. Practice the one-in-one-out rule</h3>



<p>If you have limited closet space and there&#8217;s no possibility of increasing the closet space, practice the one-in-one-out rule. In practice, this means if you buy a new pair of shoes or a new dress, something needs to be taken out and either recycled or donated.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-create-visible-boundaries">11. Create visible boundaries</h3>



<p>One person&#8217;s belongings drifting to another partner&#8217;s territory is not an unusual scene when it comes to sharing a closet. So it is a good idea to use colored-coded baskets and bins to segregate the space inside the closet. You can even use different color hangers to hang clothes on the common hanging rod. Finally, use separate laundry boxes to gather your dirty clothes instead of impeding your partner&#8217;s closet.</p>



<p>Follow these basic but practical couple closet ideas to keep all your belongings organized, and there will be possibly no hang-ups &#8212; be it in your closet space or your relationship. Keep the lines of communication open when it comes to closet-related matters. Finally, be respectful of each other&#8217;s belongings and feelings. After all, these are just clothes. What matters most is your bond with one another.</p>

<p>Like a never-ending rollercoaster, trends come and go. Sure, variations set in, but at its core, these variations only serve to reinforce the new concept. Coliving is one such concept. &#8216;What is coliving&#8217; is the question on many lips&#8230;and a question we&#8217;ll answer in this article!</p>



<p>It&#8217;s helpful to remember that although shared apartments have been around for some time, the concept of coliving spaces is only just gaining worldwide acclaim. What makes it confusing is that both situations are similar.</p>



<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll cover what is coliving, its pros and cons, and how to decide if it is the right option for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-coliving">What is coliving?</h2>

<p>Coliving is a modern form of shared housing that allows you to live with like-minded people while maintaining your privacy. Usually, each resident has their bedroom while the rest is a communal space. It is different from the typical roommate situation because the community is usually larger, the amenities more luxurious, the living cost lower, and conflicts lesser (because of like-minded roommates).</p>



<p>Companies that offer coliving effect this by matching like-minded residents, rolling out individual lease agreements, providing cleaning services, and offering luxury amenities. With all these available at a lower price, it is easy to see why coliving is an attractive option for students, entrepreneurs and young professionals.</p>



<p>It is important to note that because residents have their individual lease agreements, you&#8217;re only responsible for your rent and won&#8217;t need to worry abut whether the others have paid or not.</p>

<p>Coliving spaces vary from apartment to apartment and from city to city. Generally, you can expect to find separate rooms and shared communal spaces. Usually, the communal spaces are preinstalled with necessary furnishings and amenities &#8211; luxury ones &#8211; to make the residence more attractive.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that there&#8217;s more than one way to colive. A few possible arrangements include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Traditional shared housing</strong>: Here, a group of people rent an apartment together, and share the lease. They also furnish the home together.</li><li><strong>Dorm-style housing</strong>: Comprises privately owned rooms with hallways that lead to shared communal spaces. Can run from a few rooms to hundreds of rooms depending on the size of the building.</li><li><strong>Co-ops</strong>: Large apartment buildings owned by several shareholders and run by a board. Apartments are individual but the shared spaces make coops good for people who want to raise their family in a community setting.</li><li><strong>Co-housing</strong>: These communities consist of single-family homes spread around a general house, with lots of green space and organized events.</li><li><strong>Communes</strong>: Made up of communities where members share political or spiritual beliefs. A monastery may fall into this category.</li></ol>

<p>As with almost everything, coliving has both its advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few of them to help you decide if coliving is worth considering:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-of-coliving">Pros of Coliving</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>More for less</strong>: Coliving spaces allow young entrepreneurs to pool resources together to fund apartments in city boroughs they may otherwise not be able to purchase. The apartments usually also come with extras in the form of fully furnished shared spaces, amenities like game rooms, gyms, etc.</li><li><strong>Increased sense of security</strong>: There is safety in numbers. Apart from the high-level security that is usually associated with these apartments, knowing that you&#8217;re not alone can make you feel that much safer.</li><li><strong>Luxury amenities</strong>: Unlike with traditional renting where you have to cover bills for any utility and amenity, many coliving spaces are well furnished and pre-fitted with luxury apartment amenities</li></ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cons-of-coliving">Cons of Coliving</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Limited to major cities</strong>: Coliving as a trend is just catching on. What this means is that it is not yet available in every city. To enjoy this residential option, you might need to be based in a major city.</li><li><strong>No influence on housemate selection</strong>: Your individual preference does not matter in the tenant selection process, so you could end up with a total stranger you don&#8217;t get along with. However, coliving spaces try to match residents with similar interests together to reduce risk of conflict.</li><li><strong>Problem over use of communal spaces</strong>: As with shared apartments, problems can arise over communal spaces. You may want to binge watch your favorite soap opera while your house mate wants the quite calm of RnB music while they lounge on the sofa. Another may want to have friends over. These conflicting interests will lead to problems you wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with if you lived alone.</li></ol>

<p>Deciding whether to pursue a coliving option or otherwise is a choice you have to make on your own. While it is a good rent option, it isn&#8217;t right for everyone. Nonetheless, if you want the luxury of a community but cherish your privacy, it may be the right option for you. Take your time. Weigh up your options based on your budget and your home preferences and decide if you want to opt for traditional renting or coliving. Your perfect home is out there somewhere!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bottom-line">Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Having a senior roommate can be beneficial in a variety of ways. If you hadn&#8217;t thought about it before, it’s time to reconsider. In the sitcom Two And a Half Men, we see Alan and his son Jake move in with Alan&#8217;s older brother, Charlie. Jake didn&#8217;t really get a choice in the matter (Charlie is his uncle), but he does wind up living with a senior roommate. And it doesn&#8217;t turn out so bad!</p>

<p>Life on social security or retirement payments can make it difficult for many seniors to maintain the same standard of living they enjoyed during their working years. In an increasingly costly world, living on a fixed income presents problems. Especially since the expense of maintaining living spaces and the cost of an assisted living facility have both increased.</p>

<p>According to data from SpareRoom, the number of individuals over 50 living with roommates is rising nearly twice as quickly as any other age group. One in every five of them is sharing a room for the first time. And it&#8217;s typically following life events such as divorce or empty nesting. Many of them are motivated by financial considerations, particularly by elderly individuals who want to remain in their homes as they age, much like Charlies’ situation. And as they say, maybe living with roommates is becoming a little less <em>Friends</em> and a little more <em>Grace and Frankie</em>.</p>



<p>If you think these are the qualities you are looking for in a person sharing a space, having senior roommates is definitely your cup of tea.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. A unique first hand experience</h2>



<p>While senior housemates are increasingly using social media, they are still lagging behind younger generations. This implies that elders have a wealth of information that you can only learn by living with them or through connecting with them in person. And, especially if you&#8217;re new to the city, who knows what amazing things you&#8217;ll learn! If only there was a book that contained the wisdom passed on by Charlie to Jake right?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Financial and social benefits</h2>



<p>With one of the highest generational divorce rates and more children moving out, many baby boomers are finding themselves living alone. Living alone is a predictor of loneliness and a risk factor for health concerns. These concerns include depression, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline, according to some studies on social isolation among older individuals.</p>



<p>Sharing a place with someone else can help them feel less lonely. And sometimes also helps you feel like you have family around. Though Charlie had no issues with his ‘social life’, he did consider Jake and Alan a bond he needed.</p>

<p>Older Americans who live alone are likewise more financially strained than those who live with others. According to Pew Research, just 33% of older individuals feel financially secure living alone. Further, SpareRoom statistics show that 63% of tenants over 50 are rent-burdened.</p>



<p>Sharing expenses while living independently can help senior citizens extend a fixed income before they decide to move to a more expensive assisted living residence. As long as the seniors can maintain their independence, the savings over continuing care retirement communities can be substantial.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Social security – especially for senior women</h2>



<p>Older women typically feel less pressed to stay in marriages for cultural or religious reasons now that divorce is less stigmatized. In fact, studies show that women are the ones who initiate the majority of divorces. Living with someone who loves her independence may be freeing and powerful for any young person. However, it&#8217;s also reassuring to know that simply being yourself can add to a senior roommate&#8217;s or older person&#8217;s happiness!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to find senior roommates</h2>



<p>Roomi is a roommate finder app that works on both Android and iOS devices. All of the postings and users on Roomi are screened to ensure that there are no red flags or fraudsters posing as potential roommates. It&#8217;s simple to use for both millennials and elders, and you can sign up for an account for free. Simply submit an ad or search for roommates once you&#8217;re up and running. Then, message those you think could be compatible. The software even goes so far as to transfer your roommate&#8217;s share of the rent on the day they move in. So, it&#8217;s well worth your time.</p>
