<p>We’re all on the same page on this. One of the most unpleasant chores is cleaning the bathroom! Stray hairs, mildew stains, and sometimes worse. But maintaining its cleanliness and regularly deep cleaning it is imperative. Because it <em>is</em> the place where you spend some quality alone time, too!</p>



<p>We have some easy hacks to help you get your bathroom cleaned quickly. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-divide-chores-with-your-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lighten your ch’ordeal</a> with these tricks:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Erase stubborn stains with baking soda</h2>



<p>When your bathroom cleaning solution and the sturdy dish brush have tried their best but conspicuous traces of mildew stains still stick around, reach for the baking soda.</p>



<p>Apply a paste of 3 parts baking soda and 1 part water and let it sit for three to four hours; spray with white vinegar liberally, and then thoroughly scrub and rinse it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Clean your toilet with antacid and mouthwash</h2>



<p>A few years ago, someone found out that pouring a can of cola into the bowl helped clean the toilet, and everyone had to try it! Even though it worked, here are two more alternative hacks you’ve got to try:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Antacid tablets:</strong> Drop two antacid tablets into the water in the toilet bowl and let them dissolve. After about 20 minutes, scrub the bowl and flush!</li><li><strong>Mouthwash:</strong> All it takes is a quarter cup of your daily mouthwash. Pour this into the bowl and let it sit for half an hour before you scrub and flush!</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Tackle grease and soap scum with baking soda and ammonia</h2>



<p>Get rid of those grease stains and aged soapy layers with a mixture of baking soda and ammonia.</p>



<p>All you need for this bathroom cleaning hack is 2 cups of warm water, 3 tablespoons of baking soda, and half a cup of household ammonia. Stir these ingredients together, wipe the solution on the stained spots, and rinse off with a wet rag.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Deodorize the drain with baking soda and vinegar</h2>



<p>The offensive odors from within the drain is a huge turn off when the bathroom is seemingly gleaming with cleanliness!</p>



<p>All you need is one cup of baking soda and two cups of white vinegar to get the drain to smell fresh, too. Pour the baking soda into the drain followed by the vinegar and after half an hour, flush it all with hot water.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Clean your bathroom chrome fixtures with lemon</h2>



<p>The citric acid in lemons is strong! Tackle the long-dried water flow and droplets on your chrome fixtures by rubbing lemon over these spots. A sponge should help you spread the lemon juice perfectly. The citrus fruit will also leave a pleasant smell behind!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Wipe the mirror clean with black tea</h2>



<p>All the condensed steam and soap-water droplets quickly get the bathroom mirrors dirty and blurry. It’s very unfair how unrealistically speckless the mirrors in movies are!</p>



<p>If you want a clean bathroom mirror, brew yourself a cup of strong black tea and take it to the bathroom! Wipe your mirror in circles with a soft cloth dipped in black tea. Then wipe again with a clean dry cloth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Soak your showerhead in vinegar</h2>



<p>It’s easy to clean your showerhead and prevent it from clogging. Do it with half a bowl of vinegar!</p>



<p>Every once in a while, remove the showerhead from the fixture and soak it in vinegar in a bowl. Cover with a lid and let it sit for a couple of hours. If your showerhead is undetachable, fill half a plastic bag with vinegar, immerse the showerhead in it, and secure the opening with a rubber band.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Clean the grout between tiles with these cleaning agents</h2>



<p>The dirt between tiles is tough! But with some Borax, baking powder, kosher salt, and bleach, you can trick them. Mix together one cup each of Borax, baking powder and kosher salt, sprinkle on dirty areas, and scour. Then place cotton balls soaked in bleach on grout lines that need cleaning; leave them overnight before rinsing your bathroom surfaces.</p>



<p>Cleaning your bathroom can really be made into a creative chore with these tricks to help you out!</p>
