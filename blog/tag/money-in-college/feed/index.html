<p>Being on a first-name basis with your financial aid department will give you the opportunity to explore if you are eligible for financial aid or additional grants and scholarships. Don’t be afraid to ask for help!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Save money in college by making a weekly spending schedule </h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Utilize your meal plan to save money in college</h2>

If you’re paying for a <a href="https://www.everydollar.com/blog/create-a-meal-plan" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">meal plan</a>, make sure you use it. Go to the dining hall with friends and research other food spots on campus that are covered by your meal plan. Dining halls offer a variety of food options and are much more convenient than going to the grocery store weekly. Be smart, save money in college by going to the dining hall!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Be mindful of your spending on food and drinks</h2>



<p>Overspending can be tempting when friends regularly want to order pizza or go out to the bar (only if you’re 21, of course!) When making a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/10-ways-save-money-food-shopping" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">weekly spending schedule</a>, make sure a portion of that spending is for food and drinks. If you go out to the bar with friends, make sure that you have a limited amount of cash on hand instead of a credit card. </p>



<p>This will really help you save money in college, so you are not tempted to splash out. Don&#8217;t worry if you’ve spent too much money one week, suggest a movie night in with friends instead of going out!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Make a grocery list</h2>



<p>If you like to keep snacks in your room, make a list before going to the grocery store. Be sure to avoid going to the grocery store when you’re hungry; this will make you want to buy everything in sight! Buy off-brand items and items that come in bulk. They’re usually cheaper and will effectively save you money in college.</p>

Plan out the snacks that you want to have before making a trip to the grocery store. Try vegetables and hummus as a snack &#8211; it’s healthy <em>and</em> affordable!</p>
