										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving to a big city is exciting, but it can also be a stressful experience, especially if you’re relocating to a new country. Looking for a new place to live, figuring out your transport routes, and so on, can be tiresome. This is why having a room finder to help you out is a great idea. Choosing the best website to find rooms for rent can be confusing because of the number of options available online. Here, we’ve compared Roomi and PadMapper to give you an idea of what each offers. With this information at your fingerprints, you can then choose the best room finder for you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="features-what-filters-preferences-do-these-room-finders-offer-to-help-you-find-your-perfect-room">Features: What filters &amp; preferences do these room finders offer to help you find your perfect room?</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re looking for a room, you probably already have an idea of the kind of things that are important to you. For example, you may want to live in an apartment that allows pets and smoking. Or if you&#8217;re looking for a roommate, maybe someone who&#8217;s quiet, non-smoking, and has no pets. Speaking to several roommates or landlords can become an exhausting process. This is why you should use a room finder to help you filter out things from the get-go and make the whole process simpler! We’ve explored the most basic features any good room finder should have and compared Roomi and PadMapper across each of them. Read on to learn more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No fee apartments</h3>



<p>The PadMapper app and website have a filter called “no broker fee” which allows you to view listings with no additional fees on top of your rent. On Roomi, however, all listings are no-fee! That means you&#8217;ll know exactly what the room costs, with no hidden extras.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Both room finder portals allow you to filter listings by whether they’re pet-friendly. However, PadMapper only lets you select either cat or dog-friendly properties. Roomi goes one step beyond this and enables you to choose listings that allow other pets too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>While you can sublet through PadMapper, you follow the same process as messaging the lister through the portal. Roomi helps you to sublet safely, by allowing you to request potential roommates to complete background checks. You can also directly chat with them securely through the app or website.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>The PadMapper interface allows you to filter amenities by typing out the amenity that you&#8217;re looking for, e.g. a washing machine. However, this quickly becomes tiring when you&#8217;ve got a lot of preferences to add. In contrast, Roomi has over fifteen amenities already listed that you can simply tick to filter your listings by!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type">Filtering rooms based on Listing Type</h3>



<p>Both room finder portals allow you to filter rooms based on listing type. But like almost every point on this list, Roomi has that one little extra thing that pushes it ahead. In this case, with Roomi you can also filter by shared room or private room in addition to the whole place. PadMapper, on the other hand, only allows you to pick between different property types.</p>

Here’s The Ultimate Checklist You Need To Follow</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>

<p>Here’s an interesting feature that is actually super helpful but unfortunately not found on PadMapper. Roomi gives you a list of over ten house rules you can choose from to filter your searches. This will help you make sure that you and your potential roommates are on the same page before you agree to move in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-are-these-room-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are these room finder apps free or paid?</h2>



<p>Like with anything you’re using to help you, it’s important to keep in mind the monetary investment you’ll be putting in and whether it’s worth it. We’ve taken a look at the costs of using the Roomi and PadMapper app to confirm whether they’re free or paid, and what the advantages of each plan are. With all of these details, we hope you’ll be able to settle on the best website to find rooms for rent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings">Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>PadMapper is a free, map-based room finder. While it doesn’t have a paid option, it takes apartment listings from other websites like Airbnb and ForRent and puts them on a map in the radius you’re looking in. There aren’t any costs to sign up and you can view all the listings you want. Roomi on the other hand has paid and free versions. In the free version, Roomi allows all users to sign up and post listings for free. It&#8217;s also free to search through the listings to rent. The paid version also allows you to activate up to two listings a day on the platform itself!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-App Messaging</h3>



<p>On PadMapper, there’s no way to submit an application directly on the website. Instead, you can only contact the lister directly, which makes the process less safe. In the free version of Roomi, you can send up to five messages or swipes a day. What’s more, with the paid Roomi Gold subscription at just $29.99 a month, you can choose between personal and business accounts. As a personal account holder, you can send unlimited messages, ID verification, and the highlight – a ranking boost that allows you to view seven times as many ratings! With the number of features you get with the Gold plan, investing is definitely worth it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How Do These Apps Ensure That The Listings Are Credible?</h2>

<p>If you’re moving to a whole new city, safety is one of the key aspects you want to keep in mind. You should always ensure that the room finder website or app you use to find accommodation considers this aspect. Whether it comes to trustworthy renters, roommates, or localities, it pays to do your research.</p>



<p>To check that you are a real person, PadMapper asks you to connect your Facebook account for verification. Roomi takes a few more steps to make sure you and your details are safe. Firstly, the team only shows you rooms listed by people whose contact details have been properly verified. Listers have multiple options to choose from to verify their profiles and the level of verification is displayed for you to see. Secondly, if you feel something’s wrong with a listing, you can report it to Roomi’s 24/7 moderation team. All in all, it’s a great interface that keeps your privacy and safety top priority!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?</h2>



<p>Using a room finder is great to make your life easier when you are hunting for a place to live in a new city! The best website to find rooms for rent is the one that helps you find everything you need in one place, with minimal effort on your end. Such room finders may appear impossible to find, but through this article, you’ve probably realized that’s not the case.</p>



<p>While PadMapper seems to be an easy interface to find room listings on, it definitely struggles to compete with the wide array of features offered by Roomi. To sum up, with Roomi you can rest assured that your room has the exact amenities you need and that your private details are safe. You can also be confident that you&#8217;ll be sharing your space with only the number of people you choose.</p>

<p>An online room finder should filter by location, amenities, apartment types, price range and more. This means a user can simply jump on and input their preferences, making room finding fast, easy and stress-free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments">No-fee apartments</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re a mover, your primary aim should be to search for listings on a reliable room finder. All listings on Roomi are no-fee, meaning that the Lister doesn&#8217;t charge an extra fee based on the percentage of the rent. StreetEasy, however, has mandated that its users pay a broker fee.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>



<p>You can&#8217;t leave your furry or feathery best friends behind, which is why there&#8217;s a pet-friendly filter on Roomi. There are distinct pet categories, where you can choose apartments suitable for dogs, cats or other pets. StreetEasy also provides the option to search pet-friendly apartments.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Roomi is an easy-to-use room finder and roommate finding platform that allows you to sublet rooms safely, and find roommates who are perfect for you. StreetEasy also provides these same features, but it solely bases its services in New York City. Roomi operates in multiple cities in the United States and also boasts a wider international presence, available in countries like Mexico, Canada, and more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities">Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>StreetEasy has a couple of amenities filters, but Roomi has covered <em>all</em> bases when it comes to filtering your search for apartments. Do you want to know whether a particular room has WiFi, air conditioning, private bathrooms, and other vital utilities? Well, you can find that out on your room search, without even stepping foot outside your door.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type-entire-place-shared-rooms">Filtering rooms based on listing type (entire place/shared rooms)</h3>



<p>Roomi also allows users to filter listings based on the place they want to live in. For example, a couple that lives together would be able to browse for listings on the Roomi website and find a room suitable for a couple to share. StreetEasy, on the other hand, doesn&#8217;t provide this feature, so couples might run into more issues if they want to live together.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules">Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>



<p>Everyone has their preferences, and most people want to live with roommates that have similar values and lifestyles as they do. With this in mind, Roomi allows you to filter choices for potential roommates. You can filter roommate searches based on age, gender and house rules — the pet-friendly filter comes in useful here, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?</h2>



<p>No one wants to fork out high fees for a room finder that doesn&#8217;t offer the best features. The great thing about Roomi is that they consider your needs first, and so they offer wonderful features at affordable prices. Here are some features that make Roomi stand out from StreetEasy, as one of the best websites to find rooms for rent.</p>



<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/faq/is-roomi-free-to-use/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Roomi free to use?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="free-listings">Free listings</h3>



<p>All Roomi users have 2 free credits that can be used to either create 2 listings or activate any pending or deactivated listings. It’s absolutely free to search for a room to rent. However, to get the best out of Roomi, subscribing to the Gold Package comes with several tantalizing benefits. That includes access to unlimited messages with potential roomies, a ranking boost for 7x more views on your profile, and more. The subscription also comes with an optional background check, an extra step to guarantee your safety. The Gold subscription is priced at $29.99 per month or $14.99 per week.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging">In-app messaging</h3>



<p>Roomi, the StreetEasy alternative, offers secure in-app messaging to its users, keeping information shared between potential roomies private. Users can also request for Roomi to delete personal information after they&#8217;ve found a roommate match. They can do so under the General Data Protection Regulation by contacting Roomi customer support, or by filling a form. With Roomi, you can also message any lister for free &#8211; a feature that&#8217;s not available on StreetEasy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?</h2>

	</div>
	


<p>Roomi, the StreetEasy alternative, takes its users&#8217; privacy and security seriously. Your listing address is not visible to others on Roomi. Instead, the app provides an approximate location for listings in public search results.</p>



<p>Roomi makes sure that only real people with an actual room for rent can list a room on Roomi. Hence, most listers on Roomi verify their account by providing a copy of their lease, utility bill or government-issued ID. You will see certain badges on a user&#8217;s listing that showcases the forms of verification they have provided. The Security and Safety Team will also require verification of the address from the room lister.</p>



<p>Roomi has an in-house content moderation team that reviews listings and profiles for behavior that violates any of the Roomi policies, and you can report questionable users or listings too.</p>



<p>StreetEasy, in a bid to protect users from fake listings, does a background check on all proposed listings before posting it on their site. They also allow users to report suspicious listings. However, their customer service is not as extensive as Roomi&#8217;s and there may be a longer wait for a reply.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-which-is-the-best-room-finder-for-you">So, Which Is the Best Room Finder For You?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that a good room finder makes all the difference when setting out on your apartment hunt. StreetEasy is great for finding rooms, but Roomi makes the process a lot easier for you. They offer free services as well as paid services, like background checks, identity verifications, messaging plans, listing credits, profile boosts, and listing boosts.</p>



<p>Unlike Roomi, StreetEasy charges broker fees, a feature that has not fared well with its users, as many StreetEasy reviews show. And, considering the no-fee apartments feature, and wide variety of amenities and house rules filters, there&#8217;s no doubt that Roomi is the best room finder for you.</p>

<p>Not willing to go through pages of Roomgo reviews to find out if the app is a match for you? It’s a challenging task to find out which is the best room finder out there. Here, we’ve listed a number of features that are important to ensure that you have an excellent room finding experience. Let’s find out how well Roomgo and its alternative, Roomi, both fare!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-apartments"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />No fee apartments</h3>



<p>Roomi and Roomgo allow you to list your room for free. On Roomgo, you can indicate the number of rooms available for rent while creating the listing. According to some Roomgo reviews, however, you may need to upgrade to a premium plan to get more matches on your listing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Pet-friendly apartments</h3>



<p>Roomi and Roomgo allow you to indicate whether the room that you’re listing is pet-friendly. When trying to find rooms for rent on Roomgo, you can filter the available rooms based on this feature. On Roomi, you can also quickly filter your options to find rooms which are happy to accommodate your furry friend.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Subletting</h3>



<p>Roomi and Roomgo allow you to list only the available rooms instead of the entire apartment.</p>



<p>Roomi allows listers to have at least 2 active listings to make it easier to advertise the available rooms.</p>



<p>While trying to find rooms for rent on Roomgo, you can indicate whether you’re advertising as the landlord or as a roommate.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-amenities"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Filtering rooms based on amenities</h3>



<p>Roomi understands that each user has different needs. Hence, this room finder app encourages users to filter room according to the amenities that they require, to get them closer to finding the room of their dreams. Based on this feature, Roomi is definitely a preferred Roomgo alternative.</p>



<p>Though listers have to specify the amenities available, when trying to find rooms for rent on Roomgo, users aren’t able to filter according to the amenities they prefer. That could mean more time spent endlessly scrolling through listings that aren&#8217;t right for you. And that&#8217;s time you could be spending picking out your new plant, is it not?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-listing-type"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Filtering rooms based on Listing Type</h3>



<p>Roomi allows users to quickly filter through the listing type. If you’re comfortable with shared rooms, you can only view related listings. It’s easy to browse through rooms which are tailored to your preference.</p>



<p>Roomgo allows users to filter according to house type, though you only get to filter based on your preference for a home or an apartment. However, unlike Roomi, you cannot filter based on preferences for renting an entire place or opt out of shared rooms.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="filtering-rooms-based-on-house-rules"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Filtering rooms based on House Rules</h3>



<p>Another unique feature that Roomi offers but is not yet available on Roomgo, is the ability to filter rooms according to house rules. This feature is crucial when you’ve specific needs such as a non-smoking roommate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-which-app-offers-the-best-free-and-paid-features">Pricing: Which app offers the best free and paid features?</h2>



<p>“Nothing is free”, but does that hold true when you’re trying to find the best room finder app? When you’re trying to find the best website to find rooms for rent, you may not always have to shell out cash to find the perfect match.</p>



<p>Roomi’s free plan offers a variety of features that suit most listers down to the ground. However, you can do more when you subscribe to Roomi Gold for $29.99 per month.</p>



<p>Roomgo’s monthly plan is $24.00 which unlocks a lot more features than the basic plan.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="allowing-free-listings"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Allowing Free Listings</h3>



<p>All Roomi users can have at least 2 active listings at any time. You can increase it to 5 by susbscribing to the Roomi Gold membership, or buying listing credits. When you buy listing credits separately, you can have up to 50 active listings on your profile.</p>



<p>Roomgo allows multiple free listings on their platform as well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-app-messaging"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> In-app messaging</h3>



<p>Roomi makes it easy to connect with listers &#8211; even those on the basic plan can securely send messages to listers via the in-app messaging system. With a Roomi Gold membership, however, you can unlock unlimited in-app messaging which helps you get to know your lister (and potential roommate) better. So don’t hesitate to reach out and nab the place of your dreams before it’s too late!</p>



<p>On Roomgo, you can only contact a limited number of people when you’re on the basic plan. Though you can indicate your interest for free, you can only message listers if at least one of you has a premium account. Upgrading your account allows you to contact a lot more people and even check who’s viewed your profile or listing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-how-do-these-apps-ensure-that-the-listings-are-credible">Security: How do these apps ensure that the listings are credible?</h2>



<p>What’s the most important feature when trying to find the best room finder app? It’s the security features that help safeguard your privacy.</p>



<p>Roomi verifies their listers’ contact details to ensure that you only get to see the legitimate listings as you scroll. Think something’s wrong with a particular listing? It’s easy to report them to alert Roomi’s content moderation team.</p>



<p>What makes Roomi an incredible Roomgo alternative are the safety features on offer. Though both Roomi and Roomgo have a content moderation team that verifies listings, Roomi takes it one step further by offering various verification levels.</p>



<p>Though Roomgo allows users to report listings, they do not verify contact details for listers or those who are trying to find rooms. Additionally, when listers upgrade to a premium plan, other users can see their number and listing address, even when they’re on the basic plan. Hence, you’ve got to be a little cautious.</p>

<p>When you’re moving to a new city for a job or uni, you’re already bogged down with work. Who has the time to read through every listing to see whether they have the features you need? A good room finder should help you find a room that fits your needs, as soon as possible.</p>



<p>While Roomgo has some great features as well, it definitely falls short in some departments. Contacting listers, filtering rooms, and even knowing whether the listing on Roomgo is legit is a bit of a challenge. Without an air-tight verification system, it’s hard to know whether you’ll end up with a credible offer.</p>



<p>As you can see, Roomi delivers all this and more, making it an excellent Roomgo alternative! You can not only filter rooms based on the amenities, but according to house rules as well. It is easy to see whether it’s a sublet apartment, or you get the entire place to yourself as well. With Roomi’s safety features, you’re assured that all listings are legitimate and that you’re not wasting your time on a scam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So you&#8217;re excited to move into the big city. The thing is, you&#8217;re also acutely aware that rental costs could burn a hole in your pocket. Which is why you&#8217;re searching for the best room finder to find the perfect room for your budget and needs. Roomi and Nooklyn, for instance, help you find rooms for rent, as well as offer other services and features. While you can always try both of these, we figured we&#8217;d compare them to save you the hassle. Here&#8217;s a Roomi review <em>and</em> a Nooklyn review so you can get started.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pricing-are-these-room-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are these room finder apps free or paid?</h2>



<p>Just like any app, pricing is important, especially if you&#8217;ll use it for a while to find rooms for rent. Which is why we&#8217;ve taken a look at how much it costs to use Roomi and Nooklyn. Here&#8217;s how much their plans cost, and what you get out of them. We’re sure that after reading this article, you&#8217;ll be able to decide which is the best room finder in terms of value and features.</p>



<p>Is Nooklyn legit? With Nooklyn, you can sign up and search rental spaces for free on the platform. Under a free account, you can request a tour, contact landlords, and message real estate agents. Should you wish to submit an application, you&#8217;ll need to first pay a fee of $9.29. This is on top of the deposit that most landlords require before even considering an application.</p>



<p>With Roomi, you can also search for rooms and roommates for free. As a free user, you can send five messages or swipes per day, plus activate up to two listings. Note that to list a property on Nooklyn, you&#8217;ll need to pay $5 per listing. This is just one example of how much more you get out of Roomi as a Nooklyn alternative.</p>

<p>When you sign up for the Roomi Gold subscription, you&#8217;ll get even more value for your money. First, you need to choose between a personal or a business plan. Personal users get unlimited messaging, identity verification, and a ranking boost for seven times more views on listings. Depending on the business tier you choose, you can get a verified partner badge, unlimited listings, and unlimited messaging.</p>



<p>Pay either $29.99 for one month or $14.99 for an entire year. With Nooklyn, advertisers need to fork out $300 per month when billed annually or $350 month-to-month. Otherwise, you can pay $5 for a single post that lasts for 60 days, though this price plan has limited features. From the numbers alone, it&#8217;s clear which room finder app is worth every buck and a great Nooklyn alternative. (*<em>cough&#8230;</em> it&#8217;s Roomi).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust">Security: Can these apps help me find roommates I can trust?</h2>



<p>No one wants to end up with a roommate they don&#8217;t feel safe or comfortable around. Imagine moving to an unfamiliar city as an international student, without having a single friend or relative in the area. A scary scenario is if your roommate shows up and doesn’t match their online profile. This is why it&#8217;s important that the room finder you&#8217;re eyeing connects you with people that have been pre-screened.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="verification-of-roommate-contact-info">Verification of Roommate Contact Info</h3>



<p>When room finders can verify roommates&#8217; contact info, they&#8217;re able to establish that actual people are signed up in the app. Which is the best room finder when it comes to contact info verification?</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s do a Nooklyn review of its roommate info verification process. As a Nooklyn user, you&#8217;re required to use an e-mail address. But note that providing your phone number is optional.</p>



<p>As a Nooklyn alternative, Roomi verifies both a user&#8217;s phone number and e-mail address, using GlobaliD, a digital identity platform. Users are required to create a GlobaliD and connect it with Roomi. Through this system, GlobaliD verifications describe something about users that a third-party agency has verified to be true. It&#8217;s a far cry from Nooklyn&#8217;s required sign-up info. This major investment speaks volumes about how much Roomi values the legitimacy of information shared by users.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="id-verification">ID Verification</h3>



<p>Which is the best room finder when it comes to ID verification?</p>



<p>You might ask yourself: is Nooklyn legit? Users who create an account on Nooklyn need to undergo ID verification. Basically, you need to submit a selfie, as well as photos of the front and back of a state ID or passport. <strong><a href="https://resimpli.com/best-real-estate-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best real estate agents</a></strong>, meanwhile, have to submit their real estate license. They then go through a face-matching process, wherein they ensure your photo matches that on the ID. Once verified, you can start searching and connecting with potential roommates.</p>



<p>With Roomi, roommates need to go through a background check. Aside from the standard ID verification, users also need to add their social media account as an additional security measure. Once verified, you&#8217;ll see their profiles marked with a &#8220;premium&#8221; badge.</p>



<p>Choose who can message you by approving or declining chat requests. You can filter roommates by neighborhood, age, gender, and when they were last active. All these additional features ensure you&#8217;re able to find a suitable roommate you can trust and feel safe around.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="privacy-and-security-of-profiles">Privacy and Security of Profiles</h3>



<p>Is Nooklyn legit? As you use Nooklyn, it collects information about you and your online activities. It taps into your location, the pages you view, your searches, and even your messages. You can also configure two-factor authentication via SMS or an authenticator app for added security. Only other users signed into the app will be able to view your profile and they won&#8217;t see your address.</p>



<p>As mentioned, Roomi uses industry-leading security practices and the GlobaliD verification system. Yes, it similarly collects your personal information and usage data, but does this through GlobaliD&#8217;s state-of-the-art public-key cryptography framework. Your private data is safely stored in the GlobaliD vault, which cannot be accessed or shared without your explicit consent. This means that your data isn’t stored on each new service provider you choose to connect to your GlobaliD.</p>



<p>Only fully verified users who have undergone the background check will be displayed on the platform. No, your address won&#8217;t be displayed. Potential roommates can check out your bio, as well as your roommate and moving preferences. You&#8217;ll be able to see from the get-go if they smoke, have pets, and what their budget is. All super handy information so you can find the best roommate &#8211; faster.</p>



<p>In the unlikely event that Roomi gets hacked, know that your data is secure as it is not kept on Roomi servers. On top of the GDPR, Roomi users can enjoy secure in-app messaging to contact potential roommates without sharing personal info. Unlike Nooklyn, Roomi does not collect data about you by looking into your chats with fellow users.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="24-7-support-content-moderation">24/7 Support &amp; Content Moderation</h3>



<p>During these times when everybody&#8217;s constantly online (and in a rush), there&#8217;s nothing as satisfying as receiving a speedy response. If you ever encounter a problem while transacting on a room finder, you&#8217;ll need someone who can immediately assist you. You never know who&#8217;s out there lurking online, so it helps to know someone is keeping a close eye on content, so there&#8217;s nothing weird going on.</p>



<p>With Nooklyn, you can check out their FAQs (frequently asked questions) page or send them an e-mail. Note that their FAQs page doesn&#8217;t share a lot of the information you may need, but you also have the option to speak to a customer service representative for any complaints.</p>



<p>At Roomi, you get more than the standard customer support. Apart from this, an in-house content moderation team is working away to filter out any spammy content or bad listings. This gives users peace of mind that they&#8217;re dealing with legit and verified listings in a spam-free environment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="criminal-background-check">Criminal Background Check</h3>



<p>You never know if there are bad people out there waiting for the perfect opportunity to prey on unsuspecting roommates. Sure, IDs can be verified, but anyone can have a perfectly decent front and hide a criminal history. A criminal background check takes your safety to a higher level so you&#8217;re sure your roommate&#8217;s not an axe murderer.</p>



<p>Roomi&#8217;s background check scans for criminal records under offense categories of fraud, sex, substance abuse, theft, and violence, among others. Nooklyn, on the other hand, pales in comparison. Apart from its ID verification process, Nooklyn does not have an explicit criminal background check for its users and applicants. We&#8217;re sure you’ve already figured out which is the best room finder.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="user-profiles-which-app-makes-it-easier-to-find-your-perfect-roommate">User Profiles: Which App Makes It Easier To Find Your Perfect Roommate?</h2>



<p>Both Nooklyn and Roomi deliver in terms of providing you a list of potential roommates. With Nooklyn, you can like user profiles that display compatible move-in dates and rental budget, and message them straight away.</p>



<p>With Roomi, you have additional info so you can cherry pick roommates you feel you would best get along with. Plus, the interface is clean-looking and easy to navigate. Hands down, Roomi makes it easier and more convenient for you to find the perfect roommate since you have more info at your disposal to make a selection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moving to Houston is a great idea for many reasons. It is one of the most affordable cities in the country. It has a booming job market. It has an extremely diverse population. It is one of the top three food cities in the country. It is also home to the biggest medical center in the world. We could go on and on, but the list is never ending. So, if you’re stuck wondering whether or not to make the move, don’t. Instead ask yourself, when you should move. Because there are very few cities that are as great as Houston. And, when you do decide to move, we’re going to be here to help you find great rooms for rent in Houston, Texas. But before we get to that, let’s learn a little more about the city!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to Know Houston</h2>



<p>Houston is home to NASA’s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center due to which it’s officially known as the Space City. But that’s not all, over time the city has accumulated many nicknames, including the Bayou City, Magnolia City, Hustle Town and The Big Heart. If that doesn’t tell you how awesome and versatile this place is, we don’t know what will. One of the most diverse cities in the country, more than a whopping 145 languages are spoken here.</p>



<p>But beware of the weather here, it tends to be hot and humid. In fact, you probably won’t need a winter wardrobe at all.The temperature barely ever drops below the 60s, even in peak winters. All you need is a cute coat and you’re prepared to face the winters.</p>



<p>But despite the humidity, Houston is a great city to live in. The housing market is one of the most affordable in Texas, so finding cheap rooms for rent in Houston is easy. It is also the largest city in Texas and attracts tens of thousands of new residents every year. With a booming job market, some of the best food in the country and a relatively low cost of living, Houston is a great option for all. But carry a lot of insect repellent.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding Rooms for Rent in Houston</h2>



<p>Most people who move to Houston move here because it is super affordable. Even though Houston is a major city, the housing market here is very reasonable. The median cost of renting (or buying) is much lower than the rest of the country. So, if you’re thinking about moving here, you’re in luck. Finding affordable rooms for rent in Houston, Texas is extremely easy!</p>

<p>So, let’s take a look at some of the top neighborhoods in Houston.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top Neighborhoods in Houston</h2>



<p><strong>The Woodlands</strong>: The Woodlands is a master-planned community in the North of Houston. It consistently ranks as one of the best neighborhoods to live in, not just in Houston but in the rest of the country as well. While generally considered an expensive area, finding reasonably priced rooms for rent in this part of Houston, Texas shouldn’t be too hard.</p>



<p><strong>Montrose</strong>: This is the artistic and cultural soul of Houston. Filled with amazing bohemian cafes, theatres and art galleries, Montrose has also been a historically LGBT-friendly neighborhood. The rental market here is also super affordable, so finding good rooms for rent here is easy.</p>



<p><strong>River Oaks</strong>: No list about Houston neighborhoods is complete without mentioning River Oaks. Filled with historic mansions, just being in River Oaks will make you feel like royalty. While most people can’t afford to live here (the average home value here is over $2 million), it’s one of the most culturally and historically significant neighborhoods of Houston. Both the iconic River Oaks District and the River Oaks Theatre are here. We strongly recommend exploring this neighborhood at least once, even if you can’t afford to look at rooms for rent in this part of Houston.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University Life in Houston</h2>



<p>Houston ranks consistently among the most affordable cities for students to live in. The average cost of living for students is between $1000-$2000 a month. That’s cheaper than most cities in the country. Especially because you can find many affordable rooms for rent in Houston, Texas. Moreover, the city of Houston offers up many fun things for students to do. Whether that’s visiting the Space Center, eating at one of the hundred amazing restaurants, strolling through the Houston Zoo or catching a game at the Minute Maid Park, there’s a whole lot to do in Houston. So, if you’re wondering where you should go for college, Houston has some great options for you.

<p>There are plenty of taxis in Houston, so hailing one from a taxi stand won’t be a problem. Remember, the City of Houston has authorized a flat taxi fare of $6 for all trips in the downtown area making it a very affordable mode of travel. You can also get an Uber or Lyft if you’re more comfortable with that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public Transportation in Houston</h3>



<p>Houston’s public transportation system, <a href="https://www.ridemetro.org/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">METRO</a>, offers many affordable options for commuting within Houston. The Metro Light Rail connects Downtown to Reliant Stadium and costs $1.25 both ways. The local bus is also available on most streets with a one-way fare of $1.25.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Airports in Houston</h3>



<p>Houston has two 4-star airports, George Bush Intercontinental (IAH) and Houston Hobby Airport (HOU). It also has a civil/military airport called Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Cycling in Houston</h3>



<p>The city&#8217;s bike share program called the <a href="https://www.houstonbcycle.com/">Houston BCycle</a> has around 90 stations with 635 bikes available for short-term rentals throughout central Houston. You can rent a bike for $3 per 30-minutes from any kiosk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Healthcare in Houston</h2>



<p>People from around the world come to Houston to receive the best treatment for their ailment. Houston is home to the largest largest medical centre- <a href="https://www.tmc.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Texas Medical Center</a>. The center is spread over 1,000 acres of land and is visited by over 7.2 million patients every year.

Yeah, it’s <em>that</em> good. So, of course, we can’t end this blog without mentioning the food here. Of course, writing down all the good restaurants in the city would be an impossible task. There’s just too many. Some of which you’ll find on your own while exploring the city. But here’s a list of some of the best restaurants that you should make a point of checking out!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How transit friendly is San Antonio</strong></h2>



<p>San Antonio commute is actually quite a pleasant experience. The city is fairly easy to navigate, the traffic isn’t too bad and there’s some quirky transportation options available for you. Here’s how you get around the city!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Walkability</strong></h3>



<p>San Antonio is not the most walkable city in the world. Most people here drive to get around, which is by far the easiest and the most convenient. However, Downtown San Antonio is quite walkable with a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/score/san-antonio-texas">Walk Score</a> of 96!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Roads/traffic</strong></h3>



<p>The average one-way commute time in San Antonio, 24.1 minutes, is actually shorter than the natural average. It might take some time to get used to the freeways and suburbs, but, that’s what Google Maps is here for!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taxis</strong></h3>



<p>While Uber and Lyft are popular options, you can also use <a href="http://yellowcabsa.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellow Cab</a><strong>.</strong> Keep in mind, it’s a little hard to find cabs on the street. You can also try the river taxi. Yes, that’s right, the city has a river taxi! <a href="https://www.goriocruises.com/Cruises/river-shuttle/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Go Rio</a> has river-taxis that run along the Downtown Reach and Museum Reach sections of the River Walk daily from 10am to 9pm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Public Transportation </strong></h3>



<p>Public transportation isn’t the most popular option here, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have any viable options! The <a href="https://www.viainfo.net/">VIA Metropolitan Transit Service</a> offers regular bus services at the extremely reasonable fare of <a href="https://www.viainfo.net/rates/">$1.30</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Airports </strong></h3>



<p>The San Antonio International Airport is just 10 miles away from the center of the city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cycle-Friendly</strong></h3>



<p>The city has a public bike-share program called the <a href="https://sanantonio.bcycle.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">San Antonio Bike Share</a><strong>.</strong> It’s great for short trips around the city!</p>
