<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How transit friendly is San Jose?</h2>



<p>Downtown San Jose is easily walkable with streets arranged in a grid format making it relatively easy to navigate and locate addresses. Beyond the downtown area, however, things are more spread out and you will need to look towards driving or using public transportation.</p>
