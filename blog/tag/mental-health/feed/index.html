										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Winters can be really grim for a lot of us. The cold, dark and damp atmosphere can be brutal for your mental health. And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">pandemic</a> sure hasn’t helped. But if the gloominess just doesn’t seem to go away and has seriously started to affect you, you might have Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD generally occurs during winter months when your exposure to sunlight decreases significantly. As a result, many people recommend light therapy for SAD. If you’ve never heard of it before, it might seem a bit strange. You might think to yourself, “how could a lamp cure my SAD?”. But you might be surprised by what other people have to say about it. So, today let’s talk about light therapy and whether it actually works. But before we do that, let’s look a little bit into SAD itself first.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)?</h2>



<p>As Dr. <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_E._Rosenthal" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Norman E. Rosenthal, M.D.</a></em>, a pioneer in SAD research, puts it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Seasonal Affective Disorder is a type of depression that occurs regularly, every autumn and winter, when the days get short and dark, though it may occur at other times as well. The reason it occurs mostly during the winter months is that one of the main causes of the condition is a lack of sunlight. Other situations in which people don’t get enough sunlight include cloudy or rainy periods at other times of year, living in dark places and working for long hours in dark offices. Whenever there is insufficient sunlight, those people who are vulnerable to Seasonal Affective Disorder may develop symptoms.”</p><cite>Norman E. Rosenthal, M.D.</cite></blockquote>

<p>Now that we know what SAD is, let’s see what some of the symptoms are and how light therapy can help with SAD.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the symptoms of SAD?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">According to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/">Mayo Clinic</a>, the following are some of the signs and symptoms of SAD:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Feeling depressed most of the day, nearly every day</li><li>Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed</li><li>Having low energy</li><li>Having problems with sleeping</li><li>Experiencing changes in your appetite or weight</li><li>Feeling sluggish or agitated</li><li>Having difficulty concentrating</li><li>Feeling hopeless, worthless or guilty</li><li>Having frequent thoughts of death or suicide</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Additionally, winter SAD symptoms may also include:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Oversleeping</li><li>Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates</li><li>Weight gain</li><li>Tiredness or low energy</li></ul>



<p>If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms, please reach out to a mental health specialist. You can find more resources <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.gov/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Light therapy, the use of a lamp or light box as an artificial source of light, is said to be very helpful in treatment option for SAD.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, what is light therapy exactly and how does a lamp help cure SAD?</h2>



<p>According to .Mayo Clinic, light therapy basically involves the patient being exposed to an artificial light source as a way to mimic natural light. You’re basically supposed to do your work, attend online classes, watch random youtube videos, near a device known as light therapy box. It looks like a lamp, and it’s supposed to help with SAD.</p>



<p>While research on light therapy helping with SAD is inconclusive, it is thought to affect certain brain chemicals that might put you at ease.</p>



<p>So, while light therapy alone will not cure SAD, it can certainly make you feel better. There’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that light therapy does help with SAD.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a good lamp or light box to help with SAD?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Roomi recommended SAD lamp</strong>: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carex-Day-Light-Classic-Bright-Therapy/dp/B00PCN4UVU?keywords=Carex&amp;qid=1573223468&amp;s=hpc&amp;sr=1-3&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=sad-lamps-20&amp;linkId=0156656ac569ccea85ef9a62461fb6bd&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;correlationId=efd655b3-01da-4484-bbe7-e91f99060251" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carex Day-Light Classic Plus Bright Light Therapy Lamp</a></h3>



<p>The Carex Day-light is the best option you have at its price point. It has a surface area of 15.5 by 13.5 inches and generates 10,000 lux. Because of the downward motion of the light, it’s always glare-free. If you want to invest in a good lamp for light therapy to help with SAD, this is the one you should go with.</p>

<p>So light therapy won&#8217;t cure your SAD, it might make you feel better. And sometimes that’s the best one can hope for in times like these. You might find that it eases your symptoms and makes you feel more energized. But remember to give it some time. Things won’t change overnight, but with time you might find that light therapy does help you. But make sure you also talk to a mental health specialist in addition to light therapy. They’ll be able to give you the personalized attention and guidance you need to get better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on everyone across the world. Things no longer are the same as they were a year ago, and all of us found ourselves adjusting, and to different capacities struggling this past year. mental health has been a more important topic than ever, and we can all rightly say, that the conversation needs to keep evolving around the subject.</p>



<p><strong>According to Mental Health America, youth mental health is worsening. 9.7% of youth in the U.S. have severe major depression, compared to 9.2% in last year’s dataset. This rate was highest among youth who identify as more than one race, at 12.4%. Even before COVID-19, the prevalence of mental illness among adults was increasing. In 2017-2018, 19% of adults experienced a mental illness, an increase of 1.5 million people over last year’s dataset.</strong></p>



<p>While it may be that some of us are more vulnerable than others, everyone faces challenges in life that can impact our mental health. After all, just a few months ago, none of us had any idea that all our worlds would be upended by the coronavirus, and that worry, isolation, loneliness, depression, and anxiety would become collective experiences shared by literally everyone.</p>



<p>Before we get into how we can preserve our mental health, let&#8217;s get into the details of what Mental Health Awareness Month is.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can you look after your mental health and keep anxiety at bay?</h2>



<p>Here is some of the most tried and tested practical advice for anxiety that we have for you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Talk to someone who will listen.</h3>



<p>Talking about your feelings can help you stay in good mental health and deal with times when you feel troubled.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Take a walk, and keep yourself active.</h3>



<p>Regular exercise can boost your self-esteem and can help you concentrate, sleep, and feel better. It can also help you keep your anxiety in check. Exercise keeps the brain and your other vital organs healthy and is also a significant benefit towards improving your mental health. A great form of exercise is practicing yoga, straight from the comfort of your home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Take care of your diet, and add probiotics to it!</h3>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641835/#:~:text=Increasing%20evidence%20has%20associated%20gut,are%20prevalent%20in%20society%20today.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy gut</a> is proven to have great effects on people struggling with their mental health.</p>



<p>Your brain needs a mix of nutrients in order to stay healthy and function well, just like the other organs in your body. A diet that’s good for your physical health is also good for your mental health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Keep your alcohol consumption in check.</h3>



<p>Those of us that do, consume alcohol at every celebration, every sorrow. Some people drink to deal with fear or loneliness, but the effect is only temporary.</p>



<p>Difficult feelings only get worse if you try to manage them through alcohol. You&#8217;ll only end up feeling worse after the temporary numbness wears off. So keeping your alcohol consumption in check can be extremely beneficial.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don&#8217;t allow yourself to fall out of touch</h3>



<p>There’s nothing better than catching up with someone face to face, but that’s not always possible. You can also give them a call, drop them a note, or chat to them online instead. Keep the lines of communication open: it’s good for you!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Ask for help.</h3>



<p>Our world is evolving at a speed much higher than our minds, and people today are suffering with depression and anxiety more than ever before.</p>



<p>If things are getting too much for you and you feel you can’t cope, ask for help. Your family or friends may be able to offer practical help or a listening ear.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Take a break and so something you&#8217;re good at.</h3>



<p>A major cause for depression and anxiety can be commotion that we aren&#8217;t able to get away from. A change of scene or a change of pace is good for your mental health. It could be anything from a 5-minute break to a month-long pause. Take the time that you need, and maybe indulge in something you know you&#8217;re good at!</p>



<p>Enjoying yourself can help beat stress. Doing an activity you enjoy probably means you’re good at it, and achieving something boosts your self-esteem</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Accept yourself, as well as others around you.</h3>



<p>We’re all different. It’s much healthier to accept that you’re unique than to wish you were more like someone else. Feeling good about yourself boosts your confidence to learn new skills, and is a wonderful way to beat anxiety. Give yourself the time to visit new places and make new friends. Good self-esteem helps you cope when life takes a difficult turn. Similarly, caring for others is just as important. Bringing yourself close to people who you call friends can keep your spirits up, and form a supportive bond for everyone involved!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Oxford dictionary defines Habit as <em><strong>&#8216;</strong></em><strong><em>something that you do often and almost without thinking, especially something that is hard to stop doing.</em>&#8216;</strong> So the focus remains on <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8216;almost without thinking.&#8217;</span></em> Think about how you sleep and wake up at almost the same time every day, without even trying. And when you do try and break out of the habit, wishing to wake up earlier, you can&#8217;t help failing and need to keep trying harder. So in this article, we&#8217;re going to try and decode habits, whether they&#8217;re unhealthy or healthy habits, and how books like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomic Habits</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Power of Habit</a> can help us get our lives on track.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<p>As James Clear, author of Atomic Habits says,</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-default" style="border-color:#e22658"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-primary-color"><p>“Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.” </p><cite>&#8211; James Clear, Atomic Habits</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>How do we become the designers of our own little worlds and very big lives?</p>



<p>Especially since <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/mindful-habits-for-your-mental-health-during-covid-19/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the pandemic began</a>, we&#8217;ve probably come to notice some of the habits that we all have, whether they&#8217;re unhealthy or healthy habits, and how they come to rule our lives, day after day.</p>



<p>And if you&#8217;ve looked hard enough and feel the need to change or break bad habits, the first thing you must have realized is that it is TOUGH, to say the least.</p>



<p>So to start the process of developing healthy habits, let&#8217;s take a look at what bad or unhealthy habits are.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can we learn about bad habits from the book Atomic Habits?</h2>



<p>This is one crucial question you must ask yourself when you try to break a habit. What are your bad habits, and what exactly makes them &#8216;bad?&#8217; Is it a habit that harms your physical or mental health, like excessive smoking, drinking, or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/why-we-get-into-toxic-relationships-and-what-we-can-learn-from-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staying in a toxic relationship</a> because you&#8217;ve simply become habitual?</p>



<p>As James Clear, author of Atomic Habits writes,</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-primary-color"><p>“Emotions drive behavior. Every decision is an emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion.&#8221; </p><cite>&#8211; James Clear, Atomic Habits</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do habits form in the first place?</h2>



<p>To confront our bad habits, let&#8217;s try and understand how habits even form.</p>



<p>James Clear, author of Atomic Habits explains the process in the best way possible.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-primary-color"><p>“All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.” </p><cite>&#8211; James Clear, Atomic Habits</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is it so hard to break out of habits and what can we learn from the book Atomic Habits?</h2>



<p>We all know how tough it is to break out of a habit. Which is probably why you&#8217;ve searched the internet and landed here. But if we try and understand why it is so tough to break a habit, we&#8217;ll find it easier to finally break out of it.</p>



<p>As author of Atomic Habits, James Clear writes,</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote class="has-text-color has-primary-color"><p>“It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”</p><cite>&#8211; James Clear, Atomic Habits</cite></blockquote></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how can we break bad habits?</h2>



<p>Breaking a bad habit is tough because we don&#8217;t know where to even begin! So let&#8217;s look at it this way. Let&#8217;s not try to &#8216;break&#8217; a bad habit, but simply replace it with healthy habits. Sounds a tad bit simpler, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>This way, the power of habit is that it simply becomes a matter of making a change in your brain&#8217;s system, so that your goals can be more accessible.</p>



<p>As James Clear, author of Atomic Habits writes,</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” </p><cite>&#8211; James Clear, Atomic Habits</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A step by step guide to break bad habits as learned from books like Atomic Habits and The Power Of Habit</h2>



<p>So once you&#8217;ve understood how your system works, you can put these simple steps in place to break out of the &#8216;habit loop&#8217; as the author of The Power of Habit Charles Duhigg calls it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Observe the triggers</h3>



<p>When you engage in your &#8216;bad habit,&#8217; observe the kind of environment you are in, the triggers, and how you can eliminate them or react to them more mindfully without taking the support of your bad habit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.” </p><cite>&#8211; James Clear, Atomic Habits</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Change your environment</h3>



<p>Think about little changes in your environment that can help eliminate the need for your bad habit.</p>



<p>For example, if you have a habit of checking your phone the moment you wake up or till late at night, but wish to stop, can you change your environment to help you stop? Maybe you can do so by keeping your phone away from the bed at night? Does it help? The same goes for every other bad habit you might have.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“You don’t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.” </p><cite>&#8211; James Clear, Atomic Habits</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. A reward to reinforce the better habit</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;ve been wanting to quit a bad habit, and you happen to finally quit it, you&#8217;ll get your reward automatically enough for a few days. But slowly, you might get bored of your healthy habits and feel a craving for your bad habit again. For this reason, you need a solid reward system in place.</p>



<p>Taking the example above, can you exercise for that half an hour that you lose looking at your phone right in the morning? Or read a book you&#8217;ve always wanted to read before sleeping? Once you figure a reward system that can become automatic in itself, try to make it a part of your daily routine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.” </p><cite>&#8211; James Clear, Atomic Habits</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And by simply putting in a little effort, you&#8217;ll have replaced your bad habits with healthy habits. Because remember, your habits are here to stay. And unfortunately or fortunately (depends on the habits you have), one bad habit leads to more bad habits and vice versa.</p>



<p>So whether good, bad, ugly, beautiful, unhealthy, or healthy habits. The power of habit is that the choice is yours to make.</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk in the media about loving yourself when in a relationship. And that involves maintaining a healthy relationship with others and ourselves. Also involved is a pretty tough feat of being able to see through the red flags in a relationship. </p>



<p>And the more time we&#8217;ve got to spend at home, we&#8217;ve come to realize that even though building a healthy relationship with your self and others takes work, it is rather important. With the nitty gritty details of our lives, often barging into our heads looking to party when we&#8217;re trying to sleep, it certainly feels like even more hard work sometimes.</p>



<p>Also because that hard work usually involves criticizing our actions and choices. All so we can try and get past them to build and maintain a healthy relationship.</p>



<p>In that process then, we often times come face to face with toxic behaviors. Sometimes our own behavior in a relationship with ourselves and others, and sometimes other people&#8217;s behaviors towards us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-toxic-mean-in-a-relationship">What does toxic mean in a relationship?</h2>



<p>First, stop singing <em>&#8216;you&#8217;re toxic, i&#8217;m slipping under&#8217;</em> in your head.</p>



<p>The thing is, there&#8217;s no clear definition of what toxic means in a relationship &#8211; especially when you&#8217;re in it. And this holds true for the relationship with yourself as well as when you feel trapped in a relationship with someone else.</p>



<p>In brief, a toxic relationship is one where you constantly doubt yourself and have reduced self esteem. And these are just a couple of the many red flags that we choose to ignore when in a relationship. And then it&#8217;s all a matter of degree &#8211; of HOW toxic a relationship really is.</p>



<p>Needless to say, it&#8217;s not just romantic relationships that are toxic. Friendships, families, jobs, and even your relationship to yourself can be toxic. It&#8217;s just a matter of recognizing and then you realize that all your relationships come together in a semblance. And there&#8217;s no ONE reason you find yourself getting into toxic relationships.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-should-we-do-when-we-recognize-the-toxicity">So what should we do when we recognize the toxicity?</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re one of the victorious ones who have managed to step outside of your relationship and really look at yourself in a relationship, you might be a bit wiser now that you can step out and see the toxicity. And for that, give yourself a hug. You are now one step closer to begin building a healthy relationship with yourself and others. </p>



<p>Now maybe you&#8217;re trying to get out of the toxic relationship you&#8217;ve realized you&#8217;re in. Or you&#8217;ve successfully left it behind, and are now self evaluating and contemplating as to why you ever got into one. Or maybe you&#8217;re evaluating how you can stay the f*ck away from toxic relationships and people as a whole.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-we-deliberately-ignore-the-red-flags-when-someone-s-toxic">Do we deliberately ignore the red flags when someone&#8217;s toxic?</h2>



<p>Although reddit says this quote originated from Bojack Horseman, no matter the origin, this one hits home when we talk about red flags in a relationship.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper">    <blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:316px" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoJackHorseman/comments/76nmdm/origin_of_all_the_red_flags_just_look_like_flags/">Origin of “&#8230;All the red flags just look like flags”</a><br> by      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/beermeupscotty">u/beermeupscotty</a> in      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BoJackHorseman/">BoJackHorseman</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script></div>
</div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>When you look through rose colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags</p><cite>Author unknown</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And well, there you have it. This is why when you newly get in a relationship and everything&#8217;s rosy and wonderful, we seem to miss out on the red flags in a relationship. And the sad truth about being in a toxic relationship is that you avoid looking at the red flags in a relationship long after the rose colored glasses have come off. And maybe that&#8217;s when love truly becomes blind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-do-we-put-ourselves-in-a-relationship-that-is-toxic">Why do we put ourselves in a relationship that is toxic?</h2>



<p>Mental health expert at Lifehack, <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/778281/toxic-relationships" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">George Alonso lists a number of reasons </a>why we get into toxic relationships &#8211; which mostly ring true. </p>



<p>And deep down, the ones who get into toxic relationships do know when they&#8217;re in one, (and this is the opinion of the writer only, not of the organization) but we also enjoy it to an extent. </p>



<p>Not to say we&#8217;re all masochists by nature. But we enjoy it in the sense, that when our brain knows a kind of love that is toxic, it&#8217;s always on the hunt for known patterns, as opposed to trying something new.</p>

<p>Think about how soon you can get bored when learning a new skill and you hit a roadblock, as opposed to continuing to scroll through Instagram thinking &#8216;I wish I was as talented as that person.&#8217; </p>



<p>Known patterns are the traps of our own minds, even when we know we could do better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-we-learn-from-toxicity-in-a-relationship">What can we learn from toxicity in a relationship?</h2>



<p>As mindfulness suggests, when we&#8217;re trapped in something because of set patterns in our mind, the first step, and sometimes all we can do is to observe our own patterns, thoughts and actions.</p>



<p>The truth is, it&#8217;s often simpler to say that the other person is toxic. &#8216;My boss, parents, SO, friend or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/6-telltale-signs-that-your-roommate-is-toxic-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate is toxic</a>.&#8217; </p>



<p>But it&#8217;s tough to sometimes accept &#8211; that I might be toxic too &#8211; to others and to myself.</p>



<p>Or it might go the other way in a relationship and you constantly cover for the other person. Additionally putting the entire blame on yourself. </p>



<p>However it may be with you, all we&#8217;re saying is: stop trying to find something or someone to blame. No good ever comes from that.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-there-an-approachable-starting-point-to-break-the-pattern">Is there an approachable starting point to break the pattern?</h2>



<p>The first step is to understand yourself. Understand why you went with it in the first place. Was it a desperation or fear of being alone? Or maybe you thought you couldn&#8217;t do better?</p>



<p>Was it because you&#8217;ve only seen toxic relationships in your family? Or if it&#8217;s a job, you think you&#8217;d never find a job that treats you better? Or was it because the other person was manipulative and charming like most toxic people are.</p>



<p>Because understanding yourself is how <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/30-quotes-about-loving-yourself-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">self love</a> in a relationship can begin. And that&#8217;s the only way that toxic relationships can end.</p>



<p>So when you finally see the flaws in yourself and others, forgive yourself, and forgive those around you, but don&#8217;t forget! Take as many learnings from it as you can. And hopefully, you&#8217;ll start a new chapter in your beautiful life and never look back.</p>



<p>Good luck and love to you, dear reader!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to statistics from the <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://adaa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a> ,<a href="https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics#:~:text=Anxiety%20disorders%20are%20the%20most,of%20those%20suffering%20receive%20treatment.)" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Anxiety affects about 40 million adults (18 and above) in the US every year</a>. Those diagnosed with depression are often found to have an anxiety disorder as well. The uncertainty brought about by the pandemic and more recent events such as the riot on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/where-the-investigation-into-the-capitol-hill-riots-now-stands-99964485787" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capitol Hill</a> has not made matters any easier.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>“As the pandemic relentlessly persists, we are seeing the highest levels of anxiety and depression reported since the pandemic hit the U.S. in March,” </em></p><cite><em>Paul Gionfriddo, president and CEO of MHA (Mental Health America)</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Mental health issues like anxiety can be brought on by several things working simultaneously. No one is totally immune, and most of the time, the condition is treatable.</p>



<p>The sooner you catch it, the easier it is to treat. The best way to keep ourselves and our loved ones healthy is to be more aware. In apartments with roommates, it is good to keep an eye on one another. Often, due to frequent lockdowns and quarantining, other support systems are cut off.</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/119838040073639409/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/119838040073639409/</a>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here are a few signs to indicate that your roommate may be having trouble with anxiety:</h2>



<p>Notice if your roommate is behaving in a manner that is not routine for him or her. These are some tell-tale signs of anxiety to look out for. It is important to note that these need to be out of the ordinary for the individual.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are they constantly tired? And have difficulty</strong> <strong>concentrating?</strong></h3>



<p>When someone is constantly anxious, his or her body produces more adrenaline. This puts them in a constant state of ‘fight or flight’ and can make sleeping difficult. So, they are more prone to being tired all the time.</p>



<p>If you suspect something, pay attention to your coliving partner. Has your roommate been forgetting what they usually wouldn&#8217;t? Are they having trouble focusing on a conversation? Anxiety prompts people to ponder excessively on negative outcomes, making it difficult for them to focus.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is their appetite off?</strong></h3>



<p>Since you’re in a shared coliving space, it may be easier for you to spot things like a drastic change in appetite. This is a physical indication of anxiety. Are you noticing that your roommate is experiencing a loss in appetite? Or is it the other extreme? Do you see your coliving companion binge eating unusually often?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Have you noticed them distancing themselves?</h3>



<p>Those who suffer from anxiety feel like avoiding or escaping situations that might make them anxious. Therefore, they have been known to spend a lot of energy devising ways to avoid these situations. If your roommate is avoiding conversations, not really keeping in touch with friends or family. These are indications that he or she is trying to isolate or distance themselves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can you do?</h2>



<p>How can you tell if it’s time for your roommate to seek professional help? As a rule of thumb, if anxiety affects your coliving partner’s daily life and routine, it might be time to consult a therapist.</p>



<a href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/430164201912403987/" class="wp-block-jetpack-pinterest">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/430164201912403987/</a>



<p>Being the one living close to your coliving partner, you would likely notice the small stuff.</p>



<p>For example, if they are avoiding social activities, work, or exercise consistently. These are strong indications that the person in your coliving space would benefit from speaking to a professional.</p>



<p>In apartments with roommates, you may not be familiar enough with one another to broach the subject yourself. In this case, get in touch with their best friend or a family member to share your concerns.</p>



<p>If you choose to speak to your roommate about it directly, remember that people often don’t seek treatment due to the stigma attached to mental healthcare. It is a delicate situation that needs to be approached with care.</p>



<p>Avoid forcing a confrontation. Instead, create a dialogue and a safe space for your friend to express his or her concerns. If you are unsure of what to say, it’s best to speak to a mental health care professional to understand how to do this.</p>

<p>It can be quite difficult to stand by and watch someone else struggle with a condition like anxiety. Whether this person is a friend or just one member of a shared apartment.</p>



<p><em><strong>You may like: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-be-a-good-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to be a Good Roommate</a></strong></em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you wish you could do more, here are some ways to support your roommate:</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Don’t dismiss their concerns. For someone with anxiety, some experiences can be frightening for them but not for you. Belittling their concerns by calling them small worries doesn’t actually make the anxiety stop. Instead, ask what you can do to support them.</li><li>Offer assistance but don’t take over. Helpful friends and family often forget that support is to help someone help themselves. It does not mean that you should take over tasks for your friend. In apartments with roommates, this could mean watching your friend struggle over making a decision. To support your friend, help them list out the pros and cons related to the issue but let them make the final decision on their own.</li><li>Understand more about their condition so you can avoid stereotypes and making generalizations. Educating ourselves on conditions like anxiety, depression, and so on can go a long way in destigmatizing mental health conditions.</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Currently, almost everything in this world contributes to our average daily screen time per day. There are assignments, Zoom staff meetings, FaceTime playdates to virtual workouts. And not to mention the endless push notifications with the latest coronavirus news. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard not to be on these devices all day. And although it is imperative to stay connected, the digital load is unavoidable and the burnout is real.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s time to really look at our normal daily screen time per day. Then try to figure out what we want our boundaries and routines to look like with our devices. Additionally, you may find that cutting down the time on your phone makes you more productive. It&#8217;ll even make you feel more present in the real world!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Track your daily screen time</h2>



<p>Most phones have the ability to track your normal daily screen time per day. You can also get them to send you a weekly report with a breakdown of what you&#8217;re spending time on. It’s understandable that you may want to invest a certain amount of time every day to use social media. But often times things get out of hand! So having a way to track your average screen time per day is going will help you get clearer in terms of your priorities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Turn off push notifications</h2>



<p>Except for maybe calls, text messages, work priorities, alarms and calendar, turn off the constant buzzes and pings. Especially from apps like Instagram and Facebook.</p>



<p>Thanks to social media, we no longer have to wait for our 10-year reunion to see how our classmates are doing. Despite it making us feel connected in small doses, it leaves us <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6214874/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">feeling bad</a> too.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s you, maybe you don&#8217;t want to have social media on your home screen. Maybe you want to delete it entirely and then just reinstall it when you actually want to check. That&#8217;s going to help reduce your average daily screen time per day that you get sucked into.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Block distracting websites to reduce daily screen time</h2>



<p>Create a schedule blocking sites that you browse while on your computer, especially during work hours. Do it for social media, Netflix, and even the news, especially during work hours. This will help increase productivity and help you get things done faster.</p>



<p>Although it may feel more “efficient” to eat lunch at your computer, your brain will thank you for taking a break from your daily screen time. Eat lunch while chatting with your family members in the kitchen, looking out the window, or reading a physical book. Consider going for a walk (sans phone) during your lunch break, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Use audio calls instead of video whenever you can</h2>



<p>Video calls sometimes cause extra fatigue. Focusing on multiple faces at the same time while being fairly presentable can create an added layer of mental exhaustion. So you don’t have to treat Zoom calls as an automated response. If a phone call would work fine for a conversation, use that. If you can efficiently communicate what you need via email or through updating a shared document, do that. Just because you can use video, doesn’t mean you should.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Staying indoors for long periods of time can be awfully stressful. Especially in today&#8217;s age where we&#8217;re all used to our fast-paced life of oversaturation. The lockdowns imposed across the world forced us all to find new things to do with our time. And some of the questions we found ourselves pondering over were: <br>What do we do with our time in self-isolation? How can we take this time to nurture the best versions of ourselves? And how can we hack self-development through creativity?</p>



<p>It’s important to stay informed about the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/2020/03/17/things-to-know-nyc-coronavirus-pandemic/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronavirus pandemic in New York</a>. But it’s also important to stay sane and find new ways to entertain yourself while you’re in self-isolation. At Roomi, we’re trying to remain positive about the slightly crazy, confusing times we’re living in. Some of us have also taken this time to achieve those levels of self-development that we always desired. </p>



<p>We’re also taking this as an opportunity to hang out with our flatmates. Reconnect with our inner creative, and finding new things to watch from across the world!</p>



<p>If you can feel boredom knocking on your (closed) apartment door, here are some of the ways to spend your self-isolation in creativity and work towards some self-development.</p>

<p>With jobs being cut and hours being reduced across the state, many New Yorkers are left twiddling their thumbs at home. This is a perfect time to take that online training course you’ve been thinking about for months. Whether just for self-development or to earn a certificate that looks good on your LinkedIn profile, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/sharpen-your-professional-skills-in-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">take advantage of all this spare time to work on your professional portfolio</a>.</p>



<p>Right now, some major organizations are offering free or cheaper courses to help keep us motivated during the pandemic. This is also a highly productive way of spending your time while you&#8217;re self-isolating.</p>

<p>Staying indoors means fewer visits to the grocery store. It&#8217;s also true that many of us are starting to appreciate the value of a sustainable lifestyle. Use this opportunity to start a veggie patch or herb garden! These additions don&#8217;t just add color and flavor to your dishes, they actually save money in the long-run. </p>

<p>Want to order pasta in Italian or learn the language of love? This is your chance! Learning a new language not only helps you navigate the world more easily (and impress your friends.) But it also makes you more employable. If there’s one thing we’ve learned during the pandemic, is that emotions and feelings transcend language. So why not pick up a new language as a hobby, too?</p>

<p>The gym might be a no-go zone, but it’s important to get your daily exercise. You’re allowed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/well/move/coronavirus-covid-exercise-outdoors-infection-fitness.html" class="broken_link">exercise outdoors in New York</a>, as long as you maintain a six-foot distance from other people. So there’s no need to deny yourself the simple pleasure of jogging or walking.</p>



<p>If you prefer to stay indoors, launch YouTube to find some home workouts or yoga routines. And if you’re short on exercise equipment, use your creativity to improvise and turn cans of food into weights! Keep moving by vacuuming and gardening too &#8211; do whatever it takes to keep your muscles healthy and blood pumping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter you’ve never picked up an instrument in your life. Or your electronic keyboard has been gathering dust for years. Inject some music back into your day-to-day lifestyle and learn to play an instrument. Learning to play a musical instrument is a fantastic stress-reliever and could even improve your memory.</p>



<p>Living with roomis? Give them a heads up about your musical instrument endeavors! And be sure to keep the noise down after 10 p.m., or earlier if they ask.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you’re living with someone else, it’s impossible not to become familiar with his or her <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/home-environment-and-healthy-living-habits-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">daily habits</a>. After all, part of co-living&nbsp;is learning to adjust to different lifestyles. But what do you do if your roommate’s habit is dangerous or threatening to their health?&nbsp;According to <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a>, around 30 million people will struggle with an eating disorder this year. Rates aren’t on the rise, yes. But a consistent 1 percent of the population struggles with anorexia. Another 1 percent with bulimia, and countless others deal with overeating problems. There’s a chance someone you know has an unhealthy association with food, whether you’re aware or not. Being prepared to recognize the problem and know when and how to help is more important than you might realize. Here’s how to help if your roommate has an eating disorder.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-know-the-signs">Know the signs</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Eating disorders come in a variety of shapes and sizes.“ </p>



<p>As Lauren Smolar says, Director of Helpline Services at the <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Eating Disorder Association</a>. </p>



<p>“Unhealthy intake of food, out of control consumption, and purging are all basic indicators that something is wrong. Basically, anyone who struggles with body image and relationships with food is at risk.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That might seem like a pretty general statement. But alarm bells should go off if you notice extreme behavior, so Smolar stresses observation. Significant weight loss or gain, restrictive eating patterns, secretive eating, bingeing and obsession about body weight. And irritability and isolation from friends and family can all be signs that your roommate has an eating disorder.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-say-something-if-you-think-your-roommate-has-an-eating-disorder">Say something if you think your roommate has an eating disorder</h2>



<p>Once you identify there’s a problem, it’s essential to speak up, and quickly. According to <a href="http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/facdb/profile_list.asp?uni=dg2040&amp;DepAffil=Psychiatry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Deborah Glasofer, Ph.D., </a>Clinical Psychologist at Columbia Center for Eating Disorders, eating disorders rarely get better without treatment. You might not want to get involved. Especially if you’re not the best of friends with your roommate. But staying quiet can ultimately be more harmful for a roommate who has an eating disorder.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Unfortunately, eating disorders are associated with shame, secrecy and even denial, ” says Glasofer. “By voicing your concerns you can play a role in de-stigmatizing these conditions and conveying that recovery is possible.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The trick, she says, is in the approach. Something that will likely vary depending on your relationship with the roommate who has an eating disorder. Talking about such a delicate topic may make your roommate defensive, shameful or even angry. The key is to express your concerns in a calm, supportive way.</p>

<p>“Find a time to talk one-on-one. Don’t force labels, and try to resist diagnosing,” Glasofer suggests. “Instead, just be honest and caring, but firm in your concern. Simply state what you’ve seen, why you’re worried, and possibly the impact it has on you. If your roommate is your friend, you might share what you’ve notices about how things seem to have changed…”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-get-educated">Get educated</h2>



<p>If you think your roommate has an eating disorder, a bit of research can actually go a long way. There are a plethora of resources for those seeking information on this prevalent issue. The NEDA, for example, operates a daily helpline and a number of prevention and treatment program. Additionally, they also have online forums and links to websites where struggling eaters can connect and work together toward recovery. Check the Columbia Center for Eating Disorders blog. Also check <a href="http://thefeedblog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Feed</a>, if you want to learn about and discuss the topic.</p>



<p>Seeking an even more in-depth understanding? The Academy for Eating Disorders, American Psychological Association, and even your current physician can be great assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-be-a-role-model">Be a role model</h2>



<p>As crazy as it sounds, you are in a unique position to be a positive example as a roommate. By having a healthy relationship with food yourself, you can help your roommate recover. This means no “fat-talking” or focusing on calories or dieting (especially not in front of your roommate). Instead, emphasize eating and exercising sensibly, and acknowledge how hard it can be to change your way of thinking. Being a good role model for your roommate who has an eating disorder can go a long way.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“If you have personal experience changing your mindset. Even on a totally different topic, share it with your roommate,” Glasofer suggests as a way to break the ice.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seek-support-if-your-roommate-has-an-eating-disorder">Seek support if your roommate has an eating disorder</h2>



<p>A support system for you and your roommate who has an eating disorder is essential to recovery.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The support system will be depend on the person,” Smolar explains. “It is so important to encourage your roommate to seek professional help. But you should also think about who else they can trust with this issue. If you’re close, maybe that’s you. If not, maybe it is a family member or friends. But try to get them to reach out to those people.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you come face to face with the moral dilemma of whether or not to alert parents or friends. Glasofer suggests erroring on the side of caution.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“If your roommate is unwilling [to seek help], let him or her know you are too concerned not to mention this to others. Invite them to be part of that conversation.”</p>
