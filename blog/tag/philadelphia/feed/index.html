<h2 class="wp-block-heading">University life in Philadelphia</h2>



<p>Known for being one of the greatest college cities in America, Philadelphia is a great choice for college students and youngsters in general.

You get to experience parts of college town culture (thanks to University City) and big city life all at once!&nbsp; From arts, to culture, to nightlife, Philly has everything you would hope for and more!</p>

It is possible to live in Philly on a budget. In fact, the average cost of living for students in Philadelphia is between $800 to $1300. You just have to make sure to seek out cheap rooms for rent when you’re apartment hunting in Philadelphia.</p>



<p>As you may already know, Philly is home to an Ivy League University. But there’s also so many other fantastic options! According to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">USNews</a>, these are the top universities in Philadelphia:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><a href="https://www.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of Pennsylvania</a></li><li><a href="https://www.temple.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Temple University</a></li><li><a href="https://drexel.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drexel University</a></li><li><a href="https://www.jefferson.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas Jefferson University</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sju.edu/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saint Joseph&#8217;s University</a></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How transit friendly is Philadelphia</h2>



<p>Getting around Philadelphia is actually pretty easy. In fact, if you’ve got enough time (and stamina), you can walk to pretty much anywhere in the city. But for those who don’t have that kind of time and energy (which is most of us), there are other reasonable options as well. So, here are all the ways to travel around the city!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>1. Walkability:</strong> </h3>



<p>Philadelphia is a delight for anyone who likes walking. As we already mentioned, you can pretty much walk wherever you want to go. With a walkable score of 79, philly is pretty damn walkable!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>2. Roads/traffic:</strong> </h3>



<p>Navigation in Philly is pretty easy since the city is laid out in a rectangular grid pattern. So, even if you get lost, you’ll find your way back pretty easily. The traffic, however, is a different issue. Like any other major city, the traffic here can be brutal. So, beware of the rush hour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>3. Taxis:</strong> </h3>



<p>Taxis are pretty easy to find here in the city. You can pretty much just hail one at any street, and you’re good to go. In addition to taxi cabs, Uber and Lyft are extremely popular options. Just download the app, and you’ll never have to worry!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>4. Public transportation:</strong> </h3>



<p>For a lot of people in Philly, especially college students, public transportation is a life-saver. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority <a href="http://m.septa.org/index.html">(SEPTA)</a> is in-charge of a system of buses, subways, commuter rails and trolleys that’ll get you wherever you want to go. On a budget!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>5. Airports:</strong> </h3>



<p>Located seven miles from Philadelphia, the <a href="https://www.phl.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia International Airport</a> is the largest airport in Pennsylvania. Being a hub for the American airway system, you can find a flight going to any destination you want!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>6. Cycle Friendly</strong></h3>



<p>If you like biking, Philadelphia is a great city for you! There’s an extensive <a href="https://circuittrails.org/find-trails" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">network of trials</a> for bikers in the city. And if you don’t own a bike, just check out <a href="https://www.rideindego.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indego bike share</a>!</p>

But for convenience, here’s some places you have to check out!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Looking for roommates in Philadelphia? Check the single-family houses. That’s right. Contrary to the idealistic image of roommates stacking up in a little apartment, one in five renters in Philadelphia are living spaciously in a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-family house</a>. In fact, the trend of renting single-family homes has increased sharply as the vacancy rates nationwide plummet and rent climbs steadily. So it’s no surprise roommates in Philadelphia are catching on. Here are some of the benefits you’ll experience when you switch from an apartment to a house. Find roommates in Philadelphia who know that you don’t.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roommates in Philadelphia and Single-Family Homes</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Facts</h3>



<p>According to the Furman Center’s 2016 National Affordable Rental Housing Landscape report, 70 percent of houses that changed hands between owners or renters were single-family homes. That were converted to rental units between 2005 and 2013. That basically means that houses were converted into rentals more often than they were sold. With the growing demand for rentals, and the incentive for homeowners to rent their house out rather than live in an increasingly crowded metro. It’s not surprising when you consider the growing demand for rentals. Plus, there’s an incentive for homeowners to subsidize their income by renting their houses to a swelling population of urban dwellers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Philadelphia in total is seeing an influx of renters on multiple levels in every asset class,” says local property manager Benjamin Oller. “Philadelphia proper, specifically Center City is extremely hot.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Oller, who works at Rent Philly pairing renters with landlords, says the growing demand isn’t anything to worry about in the City of Brotherly Love.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“We see no shortage of inventory among any asset class,” he says. “In real estate the old adage was and will always be location. And we can attest that that is still true. Philadelphia proper is the place to be and renters are competing to live here.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Despite local opinion, the Furman Center study shows vacant rentals are disappearing fast in Philadelphia as more people move in. The city saw a 14-percent increase in rental units.Moreover, a 23-percent increase in renters between 2006 and 2013 — meaning demand outpaced supply. The long and short of it? Vacant rentals are a hot commodity, and homeowners and renters, alike, have something to gain from renting single-family homes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Benefits</h3>



<p>So, to find for roommates in Philadelphia means paying close attention to those <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open rooms</a> in single-family homes. If you’ve lived the apartment life for years and find comfort in your small organized spaces, keep on doing you. But imagine the possibilities if you check into a house in Philadelphia instead. Here are just a few benefits you can expect renting a house in Philly.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">So. Much. Space</h4>



<p>You remember that two-bedroom apartment you were paying an arm and a leg for in that other metro you called home? Imagine having an entire house between you and your roommates living in Philadelphia. It could be a two-story house, with plenty of room to stretch your legs between the kitchen and your very own bathroom. In a single-family house, you’ll actually have the chance to have things you’ve never dreamed of as an apartment dweller. Granted, you’re unlikely to have&nbsp;<em>everything</em> you want, but things like garages, storage sheds, basements, and yards don’t come standard with an apartment. And just think about how happy your four-legged roommates will be.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Better Privacy</h4>



<p>Sure, you’re still rooming with other people, but at least you know everyone. Or, at least, you’ll get to know them. Even a small house is still a house. It’s separate from other houses nearby and only subject to the whims of the people living there. No more having to share a communal area with 50 other renters. Or awkwardly having to make forced small-talk in the mailroom. No more having strangers pass by your door in the middle of the night. Or brooms knocking on the floor or dance parties on the ceiling. And even if there are, it’s nothing a calm conversation and <a href="https://roomiapp.com/5-real-roommate-problems-and-how-to-resolve-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">open communication</a> can’t fix.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">A Worthwhile Price</h4>



<p>Roommates renting in Philadelphia can expect a warmer market than some other expensive metros. The average home sells in Philly for $121,200, according to Zillow. Compared to Boston at $480,000, or NYC at a shocking $614,500, it’s considerably cheaper to be a property owner in Philadelphia. And the rent shows it. Boston rent averages around $2,300 for an inner city <a href="http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=United+States&amp;city=Boston%2C+MA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-bedroom apartment</a>. Whereas, Philly rent is an average of $1,470 for a similar one-bedroom <a href="http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=United+States&amp;city=Philadelphia%2C+PA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the city center</a>. If the suburbs are calling your name, you can rent a three-bedroom house in the Philadelphia suburbs for $1,570.</p>



<p>All in all, The City of Brotherly love is a pretty awesome place for Philadelphia roommates to rent. (Just be cautious of a deal <em>too </em>good to be true.) Whether you’re a current resident or are moving there soon. Keep your eye on the housing market for single-family homes as more Philadelphia homeowners jump ship in favor of renting. Or don’t; they’ll find something for you.</p>
