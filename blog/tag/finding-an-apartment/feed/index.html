										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many renters dream of owning a home. That desire often extends to property investment, where they can create wealth and security. Yet, significant obstacles stand in the way. High prices, lack of knowledge, and uncertainty about financing options make this transition daunting.</p>



<p>The good news is that, with careful planning and informed decisions, renters can effectively navigate these challenges. The best place to start is to understand their financial position and explore various loan types, like FHA or VA loans; they can turn their aspirations into reality.</p>



<p>Practical steps like setting budgets and researching neighborhoods are also necessary. Keep reading for valuable insights that will guide you toward becoming a successful property investor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exploring-house-hacking-as-a-strategy">Exploring House Hacking as a Strategy</h2>



<p>One effective strategy for renters to transition into property investment is house hacking, and tools like <a href="https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The QR Code generator</a> can help you advertise spare rooms attractively. This approach allows individuals to purchase and rent out part of a property, often covering the mortgage payment. </p>



<p>Imagine owning a duplex; you live in one unit while renting out the other. This setup generates income and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/reduce-household-expenses/">reduces living expenses</a>, making home ownership more affordable. By starting with house hacking, renters can gain valuable experience in managing tenants and understanding property maintenance without the entire financial burden of a traditional investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many first-time buyers find this method appealing because it offers financial benefits and practical learning opportunities. With careful planning, house hacking becomes an accessible way to start building wealth through real estate while still enjoying the comforts of homeownership.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leveraging-investment-property-loans">Leveraging Investment Property Loans</h2>



<p>Renters can also consider leveraging investment property loans as a viable strategy for transitioning to property investors. This form of financing allows renters to purchase properties, helping them build equity and create wealth over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investment property loans often come with favorable terms, making it easier to manage cash flow while generating rental income. For instance, working with lenders like Griffin Funding, an <a href="https://griffinfunding.com/traditional-mortgages/investment-property-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investment property lender</a> that offers various loan options tailored specifically for real estate investments, can be beneficial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Understanding the specific qualifications and requirements is crucial when applying for these loans because they differ from traditional home mortgages. Evaluating one’s financial situation and ensuring adequate creditworthiness will enhance the chances of securing better rates and terms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-utilizing-partnerships-for-property-investment-nbsp">Utilizing Partnerships for Property Investment&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As renters explore investment property loans, they may also find that forming partnerships can significantly ease the transition to becoming property investors. Partnering with a friend or family member allows individuals to pool resources, share responsibilities, and reduce financial risk when investing in real estate.</p>



<p>This collaborative approach opens up more opportunities, such as purchasing larger properties or covering down payments together. Investors can divide expenses like maintenance costs and management duties, making navigating the complexities of owning rental properties easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Establishing clear agreements is essential; this helps outline each partner&#8217;s role and expectations. This arrangement creates a solid foundation for successful investments while minimizing personal strain and fostering shared goals within the partnership.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-market-trends-for-smart-investments-nbsp">Understanding Market Trends for Smart Investments&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While partnerships provide a helpful strategy, renters should also focus on understanding market trends to make informed property investment decisions. Awareness of local real estate dynamics can help renters identify promising neighborhoods with potential for growth and increased rental demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researching factors such as job growth, school ratings, and future developments will enable investors to find properties in desirable locations. Analyzing historical price movements can offer insights into whether a property is likely to appreciate over time. Attending open houses and engaging with real estate agents further enhances this knowledge base.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having a solid grasp of market trends allows renters to strategically choose investments that align with their financial goals while minimizing risks associated with volatile markets.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evaluating-fixer-uppers-for-investment-potential-nbsp">Evaluating Fixer-Uppers for Investment Potential&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Another strategy renters can explore is evaluating fixer-uppers for investment potential. Many properties require <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/apartment-renovation-ideas/">repairs or renovations</a>, allowing savvy investors to purchase them at a lower price. With some effort and creativity, these properties can transform into valuable assets.</p>



<p>Investors should focus on the location and scope of necessary improvements when considering fixer-uppers. Understanding local market demands helps determine which renovations will yield the highest return on investment.&nbsp;For those investing in rental properties or tackling fixer-uppers, finding ways to accurately budget and forecast project ROI becomes essential. Streamlining your processes with tools like <a href="https://www.dynascape.com/solutions/manage360/sales-and-estimating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales and estimating for landscaping</a> can simplify complex cost calculations, help prepare winning proposals, and ensure your landscaping upgrades add maximum value to an investment property.</p>



<p>Renovations include updating kitchens, bathrooms, or landscaping to increase appeal and rental income potential. Buyers can also benefit from programs that offer financing options specifically for renovations.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exploring-real-estate-investment-trusts-reits-nbsp">Exploring Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/investment-products/real-estate-investment-trusts-reits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) </a>represent yet another effective strategy for renters to enter the property investment market. REITs allow individuals to invest in real estate without directly owning properties, making them an accessible option for those starting out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing in REITs provides diversification and potential passive income through dividends, appealing features for first-time investors. These trusts typically focus on various sectors, such as residential or commercial real estate, enabling renters to align their investments with personal interests or market trends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researching different types of REITs and their performance helps inform smart choices. Additionally, investing in publicly traded REITs is straightforward; they can be purchased through regular brokerage accounts like stocks. This method lets renters dip their toes into property investment while minimizing risk and upfront costs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-considering-short-term-rentals-for-additional-income">Considering Short-Term Rentals for Additional Income</h2>



<p>Entering the short-term rental market is also an effective strategy that allows individuals to capitalize on properties they own by renting them out temporarily, often generating higher income than traditional long-term leases.</p>



<p>Renters can start by exploring platforms like Airbnb or Vrbo, which simplify connecting with potential guests. Investing in properties located near tourist attractions or business districts can enhance occupancy rates and overall profitability.</p>



<p>Understanding local regulations regarding short-term rentals is essential, as some areas have specific rules that may affect operations. Additionally, maintaining a high standard of property management ensures positive guest experiences and repeat bookings.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maximizing-networking-opportunities-for-success">Maximizing Networking Opportunities for Success</h2>



<p>Building a strong network is crucial for renters transitioning to property investors. Engaging with other investors, real estate agents, and industry professionals opens doors to valuable insights and resources.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like attending a dinner party where each guest shares unique experiences that enrich your knowledge.</p>



<p>Renters can join local real estate investment groups or online forums, fostering connections that lead to potential partnerships or mentorships. Learning from seasoned investors helps them navigate challenges more effectively and discover hidden opportunities in the market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maximizing-tax-benefits-for-real-estate-investors-nbsp">Maximizing Tax Benefits for Real Estate Investors&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The final strategy to consider involves maximizing <a href="https://www.nahb.org/other/consumer-resources/tax-benefits-of-homeownership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tax benefits associated with real estate</a> investment. Understanding the various deductions available can significantly enhance a property investor&#8217;s bottom line. For instance, investors may deduct mortgage interest, property taxes, and certain expenses related to property management or improvements.</p>



<p>Additionally, depreciation on rental properties provides an opportunity to offset taxable income over time. This means even if the property&#8217;s value appreciates, owners can benefit from tax relief annually.</p>



<p>Engaging a knowledgeable accountant or tax advisor familiar with real estate investing helps ensure renters take full advantage of these opportunities while remaining compliant with local laws.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-summing-up">Summing Up</h2>



<p>Investing in real estate opens up a world of possibilities for renters ready to make the leap. Embracing strategies like house hacking, understanding market trends, or maximizing tax benefits empowers individuals to take control of their financial future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, every step you take toward property investment builds wealth and invaluable experience. As you explore your options and seek opportunities, trust your instincts and stay informed. The path to becoming a successful investor is just ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No doubt about it — moving to a new city is a life-changing decision that feels both exciting and scary. There are a lot of things you need to consider: rent, cost of living, the livability of the city, type of neighborhood, and more. These factors can cause quite a hassle, but coupled with the thought of finding a good roommate? Now, that’s immensely stressful.</p>



<p>With a city as big as New York, there are a ton of ways to look for roommates. There isn&#8217;t a lack of websites for this purpose, but there sure are certain features and elements that set the best apart from the basics.</p>



<p>Sure, you’ll have Facebook groups and Craigslist posts to explore. However, a more advisable way to find good roommates is by using roommate finder apps like Roomster, or the Roomster alternative, Roomi.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-roomster-vs-roomi-main-differences">Roomster vs Roomi: Main Differences</h2>



<p>Don’t worry about the stress of seeking the best roommate finder; we’ve done so for you!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pricing-are-these-roommate-finder-apps-free-or-paid">Pricing: Are These Roommate Finder Apps Free or Paid?</h3>



<p>Roomi definitely comes out on top when compared with other roommate finder websites. This is because Roomi has no monthly subscription fees, no costs for messaging, and signing up and listing a space on Roomi is free. It’s even free to search for a place to rent.</p>



<p>However, to get the absolute best out of Roomi, it’s advisable to subscribe to its paid services. Roomi has three available subscription plans: the Premium plan for personal use, the Solo Agent, and the Business Unlimited plan for business users.</p>



<p>These paid plans include background checks, identity verifications, messaging plans, listing credits, profile boosts, and listing boosts. All of these are tailored to your needs with the following benefits:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Access to unlimited messages and swipes in your search for potential roommates</li>



<li>Post five to unlimited active listings simultaneously.</li>



<li>Free bookings</li>



<li>Fully verified status upgrade</li>



<li>Ability to boost listings with subscriptions</li>
</ol>



<p>Roomster allows users to pay for a 3-day subscription, which is enough to test the app. But a Roomster subscription costs $9.99 to $49.99. The subscription is automatically renewed after a month unless you cancel it manually. And based on some Roomster reviews, several users have complained about the exorbitant fees charged for things like viewing messages.</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/is-roomi-free-to-use/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Is Roomi free to use?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-can-these-apps-help-me-find-roommates-i-can-trust">Security: Can These Apps Help Me Find Roommates I Can Trust?</h3>



<p>If you want to live with another person in a new city, it’s vital that you find someone who&#8217;s trustworthy and safe. Sharing your living space with another person is a big deal.</p>



<p>You would probably like to live with someone who takes hygiene seriously, respects boundaries, and is reliable. This is where roommate finders come in. Roommate finder apps such as Roomster and Roomi are great, but it’s normal to ask questions like, ‘Is Roomster legit?’ or ‘How well is my profile protected?’.</p>



<p><strong>ID and Contact Infomation Verification</strong></p>



<p>Roomster allows users to verify their identity using social media, email addresses, phone numbers, and identification with a simple process. However, due to voice-over-IP services, it has provided a entryway for scammers. Also, verifying your identity with Roomster isn&#8217;t an appealing process. Roomster requires you to send a scanned picture of your verification, then pay $14.99 to begin ID verification.</p>



<p>Moreover, Roomster reviews regarding the quality of ID Verification have not been positive, with users concerned about the additional fee required for identity verification. But with Roomster&#8217;s alternative, Roomi, identity verification comes with your subscription.</p>



<p>In order to assure users’ safety, Roomi makes sure to verify the identity of every user on the platform. Users are required to submit a government issued-ID before they can become verified users. And with this, you get a verified badge that&#8217;s useful in speeding up your search for a roommate.</p>



<p>Additionally, Roomi makes use of <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/more-information-about-global-id/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">GlobaliD</a>, a digital identity platform that puts you in control of your identity and your data. With GlobaliD, you can have your number and email verified by Roomi, while your privacy is assured.</p>



<p><strong>Privacy and Security of Profiles</strong></p>



<p>Roomster allows you to create a profile where you can post stories, pictures and social media links to its community. They also ensure that all the information you add is authentic.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://roomiapp.com/how_it_works" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Roomi</a></p>



<p>Roomi, however, allows users to share meaningful information that makes all the difference when searching for roommates. Visible information on a Roomi profile includes age, profile photo(s), preferred location, budget (if entered), move-in date, summary, work info, interests, roommate preferences, lifestyle, and more.</p>



<p>Roomi also offers its users secure in-app messaging, keeping the information shared between you and your potential roommate private. Another reason Roomi stands out as a great roommate finder app is that you can request for the deletion of all personal information after successfully finding a roommate. Users can do this under the General Data Protection Regulation Act by contacting <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/faq/how-do-i-delete-my-account-on-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Roomi customer support</a>, or by filling out a form.</p>



<p><strong>24/7 Support &amp; Content Moderation</strong></p>



<p>It’s definitely disappointing to think you’re well on your way to finding a roommate while using a roommate finder app, only to realize that it’s not legit. You don;t have to worry about that with Roomi, as the platform has an in-house moderation team that works to remove spam profiles and fake listers from the platform.</p>



<p>24/7 customer support is also provided with an enlightening <a href="https://roomiapp.com/faq" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FAQ page</a> to answer all your questions and make your roommate searching easier.</p>



<p>Roomster provides customer service as well, yet some reviews say that they weren&#8217;t as useful, nor as around the clock as Roomi&#8217;s customer service.</p>



<p><strong>Criminal Background Check</strong></p>



<p>Roomi does optional <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/what-weve-learned-from-processing-over-100000-background-checks/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">criminal background checks</a> by Garbo<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> for user profiles so that you know who you’ll be living with. Submitting your profile to Roomi for a criminal background check helps to boost roommate matches.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">User Profiles: Which App Makes It Easier to Find Your Perfect Roommate?</h3>



<p>Most people have fallen victim to phony Craigslist ads and scammers on Facebook while searching for rooms for rent and roommates. With all this in mind, Roomi made it a priority to make the process easier and stress-free. Both Roomster vs Roomi are great, but Roomi definitely takes the cake when you compare their features.</p>



<p>With Roomi, you can filter choices for potential roommates. It may be awkward to ask a potential roommate some specific questions, which is why Roomi has provided the option of filtering roommates based on neighborhood, gender, budget, location, and more. With Roomi’s roommate matching algorithm, you can be sure of finding a roommate perfect for you. Roomi has an age filter, an LGBTQ+-friendly filter, and even a house rules filter.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking of looking for an apartment but don’t really know where to start, we’ve got you! We understand the stress of planning to move, apartment hunting, and even budgeting. More than that, there’s always this question of, “when should I start looking for an apartment?”. The apartment rental market can be unpredictable, so having an apartment hunting timeline is the best way to prepare for your move.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When Should I Start Looking for an Apartment?</h2>





<p><a href="https://au.reachout.com/-/media/young-people/images/legacy-articles/moving-boxes-around.jpg">Source</a></p>



<p>If you’re planning to move out, the question of when to look for an apartment totally depends on you. But, there’s an apartment hunting timeline you can follow that’s easy and will make moving out totally hassle free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Ideal Apartment Hunting Timeline</h3>



<p><strong>2-3 months before moving in:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Do your research.</strong> There are a lot of things you should consider before actually moving in. The first is deciding when and where: when’s your move-in date and where you’ll be moving in. Your move-in date is crucial because you’d have to think of your current lease, your job, and even insurance policies.</li>



<li><strong>Start budgeting.</strong> The second step is knowing your budget and sticking to it! Once you have a move-in date, you’ll be able to get a better grasp on when you need to start allotting money for your new apartment. Plus, getting a head start on an apartment fund can be beneficial for you; you can have extra cash in case of emergencies.</li>



<li><strong>Understand how applying for apartments work.</strong> Once you have your date and budget, knowing how applying and renting apartments work. This way, you can prepare any extra documents that’ll take time to get, just in case.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>24 to 30 days before moving in:</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prepare all requirements.</strong> Having all of your documents ready before starting to look is one of the best apartment hunting tips you should know. This way, the application process will be a lot more smoother and hassle-free.</li>



<li><strong>Tour apartments.</strong> Now, a lot of people ask, “when should I start looking for an apartment?” there’s an ideal time frame for this! Looking three to four months out is too far, and two weeks is cutting it too short. Usually, apartments are listed 24 to 30 days before the move-in date, so an apartment available on September 1 will probably be put on the market on August 1.</li>



<li><strong>Make a list.</strong> Now that you somewhat have an idea where you’ll be moving to, it’s best to list down your top choices, from the type of apartment, to the available amenities, accessibility, how close it is to your work, the hospital, banks, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Put in an application on your top pick.</strong> Once you have everything and you’re set on a place, put in a rental application. Usually, you’ll know whether you’re approved or not within five business days.</li>



<li><strong>Confirm the move-in date and start packing.</strong> If you have any more outstanding paperwork to sign, this is the best time to schedule a time for it. Make sure that all the documents you need are good to go.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>7 days before moving in:</strong></p>





<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/UTw3j_aoIKM">Source</a></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Confirm your moving details.</strong> Whether you booked movers or asked help from friends, this is the time to finalize all the details.</li>



<li><strong>Pack all your essentials in one bag.</strong> Put at least a few days worth of clothing, necessities, paper work, and important IDs in one bag for easy access. In case you need anything, it’ll be easier to find and get.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Moving day:</strong></p>



<p>On the day of your move-in, it can get a bit stressful. But if you followed the timeline and have all your documents ready, you don’t have to worry. You can expect the unexpected, but by the end of the day, you’ll be in your new apartment!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Apartment Hunting Tips</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Think about what you really need in an apartment. When searching for apartments, it’s important to think of your needs more than your wants. Do you really need that extra room or is one enough?</li>



<li>Familiarize yourself with the lease terms and obligations. Before signing anything, take time to review it. If the landlord seems like they don’t want you to go through it, that’s generally a bad sign. Without reading the lease terms, you may be signing yourself up for terms you disapprove. Also, come prepared with a list of questions when meeting with the landlord! Make sure that if you’re planning to sign the contract and live there, your living situation is the best for you (and your landlord).</li>



<li>Be wary of rental scams. If you’re planning to move, make sure that you have your guards up. Use <a href="https://roomiapp.com/">trusted room finders</a>, do reverse image searching, and meet the landlord or property manager before paying a deposit. Rental scams will always be there, but you can avoid it!</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding a great roommate can be truly awesome. If everything goes well, you will get a best friend in disguise and a trustworthy confidant. Having said that, you will also come across many <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/">types of roommates</a> in your life.</p>



<p>You may come across a roommate who is an absolute slob- ignoring the messy spaces they create and leaving dishes uncleaned. On the other hand, you may also find someone who is organized like Monica in <em>Friends</em>&#8211; who makes their beds every morning and always volunteers to clean the kitchen. While there is no one reason to say which personality can fit your requirements, finding someone with whom you can communicate easily is important. Everyone has some flaws but as long as it doesn’t hamper your lifestyle and your mental health, you can always get along.</p>



<p>Once you are clear about what you want from your roommate, you can proceed to find the perfect one in a few simple steps!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-interview-questions-to-ask-your-potential-roommates">Interview questions to ask your potential roommates</h2>



<p>While you meet and greet a couple of people in your roommate hunt, a good interview is all about the important questions. It doesn’t have to be as grilling as a job interview— but having a good roommate can be as important as landing a good job, don’t you agree?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/cheerful-diverse-friends-talking-at-table-with-coffee-in-cafe-6457517/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>Asking the right questions is important so that you are clear about who you are living with. Figure out what is important to you in a living situation and frame your questions accordingly.</p>



<p>Here are some <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/potential-roommate-questions-you-should-ask/">potential roommate questions</a> that you must ask?:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>“What is your work? Work from office or home?”</strong> This would determine if they would pay their rents on time and how often you’d expect to see them around. If you are interacting with students, you can ask about how they are planning to pay rent— is there a parent who is providing, or do they work part-time?</li>



<li><strong>“What do your weekends look like?”</strong> It may not seem significant, but you should know if they have any hobbies or like inviting friends over. And if they like doing the same things as you, it couldn’t get better.</li>



<li><strong>“Have you lived with roommates before?”</strong> It would be great to know if they have had good co-living experiences and what kind of people they have lived with before. It could be a red flag if they only talk about bad experiences. If they have never lived with roommates before, you could be the first to face some challenges.</li>



<li><strong>“How do you feel about cleanliness and household chores?”</strong> Sharing an apartment is sharing responsibilities, and cleaning is the top priority. Tell them about your thoughts first and see if they comply.</li>



<li><strong>“What kind of roommate do you want?”</strong> Just like you have made a checklist, your roommate candidate must also have one. Ask them what they are looking for to see if you match.</li>
</ol>



<p>Add more questions as you seem necessary. But be ready with all the answers yourself first. The interview should have them asking you questions as well. And if they don’t ask you anything, that would be <em>fishy</em>!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finding-a-roommate-within-your-network">Finding a roommate within your network</h2>



<p>Before you go on looking for roommates online or on public networks, it’s best to begin from your inner circle. You can turn to family, friends, or co-workers— find a trustworthy name and reach out.</p>



<p>But <em>warning bells</em>, maintain your guard and don’t get carried away just because you found a familiar name. People can be amazing when you meet them in a cafe or outside to chill, but it&#8217;s an entirely different story when it comes to sharing a space. Therefore, ask your questions and clarify every doubt regarding the living situation. Look out for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roommate-red-flags/">roommate red flags</a> to avoid a horror story.</p>



<p>If you found a great friend who is also in need of a roommate, be careful. Best friends are generally not your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/making-perfectish-roommates-a-reality-roomi/">soul roommates</a>. You must set boundaries from the get-go and be respectful of private space. If that doesn’t happen from the beginning, it can be a disaster!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-find-a-roommate-on-social-media">How to find a roommate on social media?</h2>



<p>If you don’t find anyone in your personal network, don’t worry. Social media platforms can be pretty helpful to expand the search. You may meet familiar names through your followers on these channels. But you may also meet new people with similar interests and backgrounds.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> is great for roommate hunts where you can reach out to a large number of people through groups as well. Create a strong bio mentioning all the details, and you can meet some interesting people.</li>



<li><strong>Instagram</strong> can help you reach out to your followers. Create a newsfeed post or story describing your requirements, and you are good to go. You may also use hashtags for your locality or city.</li>



<li>Create a <strong>Twitter</strong> post to ask your followers if they need a roommate. Again hashtags can be very useful here.</li>



<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> is generally more about your professional circle. So, you may get someone from a similar work background to live with you. Make a detailed post about your needs and requirements, and connect.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-in-white-shirt-holding-red-pen-4003763/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>You may also come across other roommate-looking people posting about their needs on social media. Reach out to them via comments or DMs to ask if they can talk. Be respectful and polite just like you would expect them to be. Make sure to refer to your checklist while <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/top-5-things-to-consider-when-choosing-a-roommate/">choosing a roommate</a>. You can also use The <a href="https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QR Code generator</a> to easily share your profile or checklist with potential roommates.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finally-signing-the-roommate-agreement">Finally, signing the roommate agreement!</h2>



<p>When you move into a new apartment, you must know about the rental agreement that you sign for the landlords. But guess what can be even more important? A <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/4-things-include-roommate-agreement/">roommate agreement</a>!</p>



<p>Yes, this does not involve your landlord or any third party other than your roommates. Finding a good roommate is one thing, but maintaining a good roommate relationship is an entirely new domain. Before you start worrying about cleaning schedules and establishing rules regarding house guests, there must be a reference point that all parties agree upon.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/women-at-the-meeting-3810795/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>There may be times when your roommate vanishes for days without any notice. And what if they forget about paying the rent? Collecting money for utilities can be more tricky than paying rent. A roommate agreement can help you avoid such tricky situations.</p>



<p>Here are some important things that you must mention in your roommate agreement.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Paying rents and bills</strong>: Messing up with the finances can lead to a lot of tension between roommates. Determine the list of things you would be sharing apart from rent, like Wi-Fi and groceries. Who will handle the rent payments? Electricity and other bills? Before anything leads to a dispute— have a meeting and discuss. List out the person responsible for collecting and paying for utilities. Clearly mention the due dates and exact amount to be paid. There are also some amazing apps for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/3-awesome-apps-splitting-bills-roommates/">splitting bills with roommates</a> to make the task easier.</li>



<li><strong>Household chores and apartment maintenance</strong>: While living with a roommate, cleaning schedules and dividing chores is a must. No one wants to clean up for the mess they didn’t make in the first place. It is best to prepare a chore list and include it in the roommate agreement- add schedules and task ownership.</li>



<li><strong>Entertainment and hosting guests</strong>: It could be fun to host parties in your apartment once in a while and invite guests over. There can be visits by friends, family, and partners. However, not everyone in the house will love it every day. Set limitations on how frequently one can invite guests and how long the stay can last. Make rules regarding the noise levels and smoking zones.</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s good practice to follow some common <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/roommate-etiquette-guidelines/">roommate etiquette</a> to avoid conflicts, and a roommate agreement seals the deal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-stay-sane-and-happy-while-living-with-roommates">How to stay sane (and happy) while living with roommates?</h2>



<p>It’s important to know how to be a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/how-to-be-a-good-roommate/">good roommate</a> first- <em>what goes around comes around</em>. Here are some practices to enjoy your apartment life to the fullest:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Always communicate</strong>: Just like any other relationship, communication is key. Living together, you may come across situations when things don’t sit tight with you. Understand that it’s okay to disagree on certain things and move on. However, don’t let the tension build up with the silent treatment. Talk to them politely to fix and resolve such situations. Most roommates can talk out disputes and find solutions, but things can get tricky if you have a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/5-common-behaviors-passive-aggressive-roommate/" class="broken_link">passive aggressive roommate</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Spend time together</strong>: An important part of living with a roommate is to know more about them. Have a coffee session together or watch a movie together. Spending time together will help you develop a good friendship and trust each other more.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain boundaries</strong>: Whether it’s sharing food or Wi-Fi, be clear about the boundaries. It is important to give space to your roommate. Even if you live in a small apartment, make some arrangements so that everyone can enjoy some personal space when they need to.</li>

<p>New York City and Los Angeles are among the most bustling metropolitans in the world. Comparing and trying to choose between two big cities can be a daunting task for anyone. But, fret not, we’re here to make this choice easier for you. You’re definitely in for an exciting journey ahead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NYC vs LA: What is the difference?</strong></h2>



<p>The first difference one cannot go without mentioning is the location of both cities. Located on the two opposite coasts, NYC and LA experience two different geographies and climates.</p>



<p>However, in spite of East Coast vs West Coast, the two cities have more in common than one would think. Whether you’re considering <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/pros-and-cons-of-living-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living in LA</a> or living in NYC, cultural and lifestyle factors and feedback can be subjective.</p>



<p>We’re here to help you make the practical choice. Below, we’ll be answering questions on the differences between housing costs, transportation facilities, safety, job opportunities, and more!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the housing costs?</strong></h3>



<p>Be it living in NYC or living in LA, both cities have an exceptionally high cost of living compared to other cities around the world.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weather in NYC vs LA</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re someone who likes to spend more of their time outdoors, comparing the weather should be high up on your priority list. Considering the different terrains of both cities, the weather tends to follow suit.</p>



<p>In New York City, you get to experience all four seasons. In winters, it’s bitter cold with snow and you must pack your good <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/nyc-winter-essentials-what-should-i-pack-for-new-york-in-winter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">winter essentials</a>. In the summers, it’s sweltering!</p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/beach-pacific-palisades-california-4694432/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>On the other hand, Los Angeles experiences clear skies, sunshine, and warm weather almost all year long. With the proximity to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/best-beaches-in-la/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful beaches</a>, it is the classic Mediterranean weather. It’s sunny and always a great season for the beach. However, wildfires and earthquakes are also quite frequent.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transportation Facilities in NYC vs LA?</strong></h3>



<p>Thinking about ways to get around the city? The options available in NYC and LA are drastically different.</p>



<p>In the city that never sleeps, you will find plenty of transportation facilities. Buses, subways, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/getting-to-know-nycs-ferry-system-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ferries</a>, and taxis are easily available and almost nobody owns a car. New York is much more walkable and hence, the transportation costs are also lower on average.</p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/pedestrians-crossing-traffic-1853552/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>Los Angeles on the other hand is known as the driver’s city. If you are someone who loves to drive around for everything, choose LA. Despite the heavy traffic, it is a better choice than public transportation. If you don’t own a car, there are plenty of ride-sharing apps.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Job opportunities in both cities</h3>



<p>This is the most important question for modern young professionals. Comparing NYC vs LA, both offer an equal number of job opportunities. Generally speaking, the Big Apple has greater opportunities in the finance sector while LA offers the best jobs in the tech world and entertainment industry.</p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/man-notebook-new-york-businessman-1071770/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>NYC also offers higher-paying jobs, considering the higher costs of living when compared to Los Angeles. However, the decision comes down to the industry and lifestyle that suits you best.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Which <strong>city is safer to live in?</strong></h3>



<p>Considering the crime rate, NYC is considered much safer ever since the 90s. The crime rate has significantly reduced in the past couple of years allowing people to walk more freely around the neighborhoods.</p>



<p>LA however suffers from a higher crime rate with significantly more violent crimes reported in recent years. Even though the LAPD is toiling hard, according to the trends, LA is not for the soft-hearted.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where do I find the best food and lifestyle?</strong></h3>



<p>Both the cities offer plenty of varieties for food lovers. Whether you are a health freak or want world-class cuisines, you get it all. Apart from that, you have plenty of nightclubs, theatres, and entertainment options in both cities.</p>

<p>Living in NYC, you can get the best fast-food chains and top-rated restaurants. With exceptional luxury and low-cost outlets, New York has something for everyone. It is also a city full of diversity and hence, you can get your favorite cuisines in multiple hotspots. The New Yorkers truly know how to work hard and play harder!</p>



<p>Comparatively, Los Angeles has a more laid-back vibe. You will feel a greater sense of relaxation. There is a greater inclination towards spirituality and fitness. Thankfully, that does not translate to a lack of options.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Living in NYC vs Living in LA: How to make the best decision?</strong></h3>



<p>Having gone through the major aspects of both the cities, NYC vs LA is a tough call. When it comes down to living expenses, both cities have their pros and cons. If rent is higher in NYC, the transportation costs are the trade-off in LA.</p>



<p>The weather in LA is better if you love the sunshine. But if you want more variety from time to time, NYC has it all. Yes, it’s a concrete jungle but there are plenty of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/a-guide-to-the-abundant-outdoors-of-new-york-part-1/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">outdoors to explore</a> as well.</p>



<p>If safety is really a priority for you, NYC is the winner. The strong-knit boroughs of New York are much more welcoming. New Yorkers also take a great amount of pride in the diverse and rich culture.

<p>Roomi is one of the best room finders out there for many reasons. Let’s explore them below!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-fee-listings">No-fee listings</h3>



<p>No-fee listings mean that, whether you book a room or a whole place, you’ll be paying no extra charges on top of the rent. It’s a cheaper alternative to Airbnb because what you see is what you pay.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pet-friendly-apartments">Pet-friendly apartments</h3>

				</div>

	</div>
	


<p>If you’re traveling or moving with your pet, Roomi’s got you covered with its pet-friendly filters. Whether you have a dog, cat, or something entirely different, you can find listings that welcome your little friend with open arms.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="subletting">Subletting</h3>



<p>Roomi offers a subletting service to take the complications out of subletting. That means you can rent out your place to other tenants, to save some money and do some more traveling! With secure in-app messaging and a robust verification process, you can sublet your apartment anywhere in the world that allows it!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="amenities">Amenities</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="753" height="167" data-attachment-id="19628" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/airbnb-alternative/attachment/amenities-on-roomi/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?fit=753%2C167&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="753,167" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="amenities-on-Roomi" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?fit=300%2C67&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?fit=753%2C167&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?resize=753%2C167&#038;ssl=1" alt="amenities-on-Roomi" class="wp-image-19628" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?w=753&amp;ssl=1 753w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/amenities-on-Roomi.png?resize=300%2C67&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px" /></figure></div>



<p>Whether you’re leasing a place for a short period or a longer duration, comfort is key. If it’s a doorman you need, a gym to unwind in, or an in-house washer to do laundry, you can choose from over 30 amenities on Roomi.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="listing-type-and-house-rules">Listing Type and House Rules</h3>



<p>If all of this sounds too good to be true, it’s not! There are even more benefits of using Roomi as an Airbnb alternative. For example, you can filter by entire place, own room, or even a shared room. So both groups and solo travelers have enough options to choose from.</p>



<p>Once you’ve filtered by listing, you can also select house rules like whether smoking is allowed or guests can come over.</p>



<p>To sum it up, if you want a one-stop solution for all of your accommodation needs, Roomi is the way to go. They offer both a mobile app and website so all you have to do is visit this <a href="https://roomiapp.com/rooms" class="broken_link">link</a> and take it from there.</p>

<p>Another Airbnb alternative, VRBO is an abbreviation for Vacation Rental By Owner. As the name indicates, it’s great for renting places if you’re on vacation. It’s got over a million properties worldwide in the most popular travel destinations. However, if you’re looking to relocate, you might find this an expensive long-term rental. You also have to pay a booking fee when you select your rental.</p>

<p>Another website like Airbnb, Booking.com lets you filter through rooms and apartments. With an easy-to-use interface, this site can help you find a rental anywhere in the world. And what’s more? It’s usually a much cheaper alternative to Airbnb. However, you’re unlikely to be able to split the cost of renting with a roommate unless you’re traveling with them.</p>

<p></p>



<p>This Airbnb alternative offers something completely different. Instead of a key to your rental, you get a passcode to your door &#8211; completely eliminating the need for a middleman. It caters exclusively to vacationers and holiday goers. Unfortunately, it currently only caters to the United States so it’s not the best fit if you’re planning on going international.</p>

<p>Definitely a cheaper alternative to Airbnb, Agoda Homes guarantees one of the best prices on the internet.

<p>This Airbnb alternative offers a fun way to travel. As the name suggests, you can swap houses with someone in another part of the world for your vacation. However, you will need to pay to sign up. And more importantly, while this could be great for a short period of time, you can’t relocate permanently using this website. If you’re a little iffy with the idea of letting someone else take over your property, you can choose to host people instead of swapping homes. This lets you earn ‘balloons’ that you can later use to travel.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-get-a-location-independent-job">2. Get a location-independent job</h3>



<p>Unless your boss allows you to work remotely, it’s time to find a new job! Working as a digital nomad, you will rely completely on the internet. With no fixed location or hours, you must develop the skill of self-discipline to stick to work. Having said that, you must find a job that won’t restrict you to one place.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Identify your skills</strong> &#8211; Whether you’re a recent graduate or a working professional, working remotely while traveling can be so liberating.

You can be a content creator, a virtual assistant, an online teacher, and so much more!</li>



<li><strong>Start</strong> f<strong>reelancing</strong> &#8211; A lot of work can be done as a freelancer. Whether you are a graphic designer, a photographer, or a content writer, freelancing is one of the best ways to earn online. Create your profile on freelance websites like Upwork or Fiverr. Building a good portfolio will help you get better-paying clients. That means more money to do cool things as you travel! </li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-plan-the-logistics-of-your-nomadic-lifestyle">3. Plan the logistics of your nomadic lifestyle</h3>



<p>Living remotely and working on your own hours all sounds great. But with so much flexibility, there are always chances for things to go wrong. Planning the logistics of a nomadic lifestyle can involve a variety of things:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Banking, taxes, and finances</strong>&#8211; When becoming a digital nomad, you must keep a tab on your finances and banking methods. Choose a good credit card company that can help you no matter where you are. When you are paying taxes and traveling between nations, you may have to hire a good accountant to avoid blunders.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Wifi, VPN, and mobile facilities</strong>&#8211; If you are working remotely while traveling, fast internet is a must. Whether you choose to live in an Airbnb in a remote area or visit a popular cafe, the wifi should be a primary concern. Get a good VPN provider so that you can access different networks irrespective of your actual location. Virtual mobile numbers are also very useful to stay connected.</li>



<li><strong>Emergency backups and insurance</strong>&#8211; When you are visiting new places, you cannot ignore that things can go wrong once in a while. Travel insurance is very handy (and usually mandatory) when you’re traveling abroad. Get good health insurance that offers good security as a digital nomad. Do set up an emergency fund that can help you in any type of crisis, too.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Getting around and finding accommodation</strong>&#8211; Finally, research the places that you are moving to. Look up all the details about transportation networks and good accommodation. As a digital nomad, you will mainly rely on the public transportation system or rented vehicle companies. Wherever you choose to live, it should ideally be well-connected and include the amenities you need to live comfortably.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-pick-your-first-destination-and-go">4. Pick your first destination and go!</h3>



<p>When becoming a digital nomad, you must be careful about picking your locations. Don’t just close your eyes and point to a map! Whether you want to stay in your country or go to some exotic location, think realistically.</p>



<p>Start by making a list of all the locations that you want to visit. Find out the cost of living, transportation, and accommodation options. Don’t forget to make a note of the climate and seasons. If everything fits your plan and budget, go ahead and book your tickets before you change your mind!</p>

<p>Considering a move to New York City? There are probably a thousand and one decisions for you to make. But one of the most important ones is which borough you’re going to move to. A lot of newcomers are stuck choosing between Manhattan and Brooklyn because of their reputations. So which borough is best for you: Brooklyn vs Manhattan? Which comes out on top? Well, that all depends on your personal requirements.</p>



<p>Keep reading if you want to find out whether Brooklyn vs Manhattan is better suited to your needs.</p>

<p>Brooklyn and Manhattan are two different but equally charming boroughs. They’re also both top destinations for people looking for new jobs, career opportunities, and those moving for school. To decide which is better for you between Brooklyn or Manhattan, here are a few things for you to consider:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-rental-cost">1. <strong>Rental Cost</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re gunning for a studio apartment, there’s not much difference in the rental costs in Brooklyn vs Manhattan. In 2019, the median <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-manhattan/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">rent in Manhattan</a> for a studio apartment was $1848 a month. In Brooklyn, for the same kind of property, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-brooklyn/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the median rent</a> was $1952.</p>



<p>However, when you start looking at larger apartments, the coin flips, and the cost difference becomes steeper. The rent in Manhattan may be double what it is in Brooklyn. Plus, apartments in Manhattan tend to attract a higher property tax (because they are valued more highly).</p>



<p>Your choice will eventually boil down to the size of your budget and your preferred apartment choice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-type-of-building">2. <strong>Type of Building</strong></h3>



<p>While some people like the beauty of townhouses, others like the convenience of a condo. When choosing between Manhattan vs Brooklyn, it’s a good idea to decide what kind of housing you want. Sure, you can find all kinds of houses in both boroughs. However, Manhattan is known for its skyscrapers and townhouses. On the other hand, Brooklyn is famous for its loft spaces and cobblestones.</p>



<p>As a result, it will generally be easier to find an apartment in a skyscraper in Manhattan than in Brooklyn. And it’ll likely be easier to get a loft apartment in Brooklyn rather than Manhattan.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-cost-of-living">3. <strong>Cost of Living</strong></h3>



<p>The cost of living in Brooklyn vs Manhattan is lower. Whether you’re shopping or dining, living in Manhattan is way more expensive than living in Brooklyn. You have to pay significantly more for the same standard of living.</p>



<p>However, the median income in Manhattan is also higher. This means, if you live and work in the borough, your salary will cover your increased living expenses. So, in the end, it’ll boil down to almost the same cost.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-commute-time">4. <strong>Commute Time</strong></h3>



<p>How much time are you willing to spend in traffic when you’re going home or to work? Thanks to its huge population and the large numbers of tourists, traffic is heavy in New York.</p>



<p>Between Brooklyn vs Manhattan, the commute time is faster in Manhattan. Not because there is less traffic, but because there are multiple public transport options around the borough. Bear in mind, too, that many of the people that work in Manhattan live in Brooklyn. This contributes to a longer commute time.</p>



<p>But don’t let this put you off if you have your heart set on living in Brooklyn. A lengthier commute gives you time for relaxation, meditation, or catching up on your favorite sitcom!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-crime-rate">5. <strong>Crime Rate</strong></h3>



<p>The crime rate has <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/pr0502/index-crime-continues-decline-april-2019#/0" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued to decline in New York City</a> over the past two decades. According to Neighborhood Scout, Brooklyn and Manhattan have similar crime scores. This is despite them having different population sizes.</p>



<p>Regardless of where you decide to move to, you’ll want to feel like you are safe. So, here are a few emergency numbers for the city of New York for you to note down:</p>



<p><strong>Police or Fire Emergencies</strong>: 911</p>



<p><strong>NYC Information</strong>: 311</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-food">6. <strong>Food</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re as much of a foodie as I am, then you’ll want to choose a borough with great restaurants. Between the two boroughs, Manhattan boasts the best dining halls and restaurants. You’ll be spoiled for choice trying to decide which to choose on your next outing.</p>



<p>But don’t rule out the restaurants in Brooklyn either. With classy customer service, lively atmospheres, and breathtaking views, Brooklyn restaurants have it all. Plus, you can expect to get more varied options for cheaper prices in Brooklyn than in Manhattan.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-quality-of-life">7. <strong>Quality of Life</strong></h3>



<p>Manhattan and Brooklyn are top destinations for people looking for work, schooling, and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/fun-things-to-do-in-manhattan-in-a-single-weekend/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">fun in the Big Apple</a>. And rightly so. The quality of life in both boroughs is very high. But Brooklyn just clinches it. While <a href="https://www.homesnacks.com/il/manhattan/#cost-of-living" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Manhattan has a quality of life index</a> of 107, Brooklyn has a <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/in/Brooklyn" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">quality of life index</a> of 136.32.</p>



<p>Clearly, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-perks-brooklyn-apartments/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living in Brooklyn has it perks</a>, but so does living in Manhattan. But which one is best for you?</p>
