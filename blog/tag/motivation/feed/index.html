										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Something that we&#8217;re all looking for, from the moment we wake up, to the moment we shut our eyes in the hopes of falling asleep, is <a href="https://jamesclear.com/motivation" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">motivation</a>! The <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/motivating-yourself-to-work-from-home-in-2021-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">motivation to work</a>, study, learn a skill or a hobby, and sometimes, even to sleep. But is it enough to look up some motivational quotes on the internet and take help from wise people who have wise things to say? It&#8217;s surely not. What&#8217;s required is to take positive, encouraging quotes and try to decode and understand them better. So we can then apply them to our lives to finally get our sh*t together!</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s us decoding a few of our favorite motivational quotes so we all can apply them better to our lives!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Actions speak louder than desires</h2>



<p>Motivational quotes are good only when we&#8217;re ready to apply them and work on ourselves and our goals consistently. There may be off days when you don&#8217;t wish to put in the work. And days when you choose just to sit back and reflect. And that&#8217;s okay! It&#8217;ll work as long as you&#8217;re putting in work to achieve what you desire. As opposed to just desiring and wishing for things to happen without putting in the work.</p>



<p>As these two motivational quotes say best,</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Knowing Is Not Enough; We Must Apply. Wishing Is Not Enough; We Must Do.” </p><cite>Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We Generate Fears While We Sit. We Overcome Them By Action.”</p><cite>Dr. Henry Link</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. It&#8217;s always a good time to start</h2>



<p>You know how when you finally decide to get your life together, maybe work on your dreams and goals, or finally learn those things you&#8217;ve always wanted to? And you come across the most positive quotes, and the most encouraging quotes while scrolling on the gram. And you start to believe you&#8217;re finally in sync with the universe. But only to think to yourself later &#8216;I&#8217;m too old to learn something new now?&#8217;</p>



<p>Well, that&#8217;s a thought process you need to change. It&#8217;s never too late to get started to work on yourself. As the positive quotes say, it&#8217;s better late than never. So pull out your wildest dreams and desires, and start working on them without worrying about how far down the road of life you might be.</p>



<p>Here are two motivational quotes to get you started.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Do What You Can With All You Have, Wherever You Are.” </p><cite>Theodore Roosevelt</cite></blockquote></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“You Are Never Too Old To Set Another Goal Or To Dream A New Dream.” </p><cite>C.S. Lewis</cite></blockquote></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="678" data-attachment-id="11589" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/motivational-quotes-to-help-get-your-sht-together/attachment/motivational-quotes/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/motivational-quotes.jpeg?fit=1055%2C699&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1055,699" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="motivational-quotes" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/motivational-quotes.jpeg?fit=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/motivational-quotes.jpeg?fit=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/motivational-quotes.jpeg?resize=1024%2C678&#038;ssl=1" alt="A laptop that says 'Just start' with a mug of coffee, a phone, a potted plant and a computer mouse on a table against a window" class="wp-image-11589" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/motivational-quotes.jpeg?resize=1024%2C678&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/motivational-quotes.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/motivational-quotes.jpeg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/motivational-quotes.jpeg?w=1055&amp;ssl=1 1055w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Habits make all the difference</h2>



<p>We and all the encouraging quotes in the world can&#8217;t reiterate this enough! Especially since the pandemic began, and we&#8217;ve all been forced to confront our habitual selves. Simply because we have more time to observe our actions.</p>



<p>So now that we&#8217;ve already taken the first step of observation, it&#8217;s now time to cultivate good habits that motivate and inspire you to go after your goals, your dreams, and become the best version of you with every passing moment!</p>



<p>As two of our favorite motivational quotes says best,</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.&#8221; </p><cite>Jim Ryun</cite></blockquote></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;When you stop chasing the wrong things, you give the right things a chance to catch you.&#8221; </p><cite>Lolly Daskal</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Push yourself, DAILY</h2>



<p>And as habits are, once you do cultivate the good habits that motivate you and push you to achieve more, you&#8217;ll realize you had it in you all along. All you needed was a steady little push, each morning that you wake up, and sooner than later, you&#8217;ll have time, luck, and all the forces of the universe on your side for achieving whatever it is you desire!</p>



<p>And however positive the encouraging quotes might be, it sure feels like hard work in the beginning, but once you do practice a little bit daily, you&#8217;ll discover that your body and mind will crave that good habit of motivating yourself, just like it craves your bad habits.</p>



<p>The mind stays the same throughout the good and the bad. This is a blessing in disguise because that means, it&#8217;s simply a matter of choice on our part! Here are two motivational quotes that say it best.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.&#8221; </p><cite>Thomas Jefferson</cite></blockquote></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;People often say that motivation doesn&#8217;t last. Well, neither does bathing&#8211;that&#8217;s why we recommend it daily.&#8221; </p><cite>Zig Ziglar</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And a little motivational quote by us, if we may.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>You can do it! </p><cite>Team Roomi</cite></blockquote>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve gone through the best motivational quotes, it&#8217;s now time to begin!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s January 2021. The days are short, dark and cold. You&#8217;d rather be sleeping in or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/7-motivational-movies-for-young-professionals-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">watching a motivational movie</a>, instead of motivating yourself to work from home. But whether it&#8217;s school assignments or the work emails that you&#8217;re ignoring, you know you would have to get to it eventually.</p>



<p>And after you&#8217;ve finally <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/convince-your-boss-to-let-you-work-remotely-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">convinced your boss to let you work remotely</a>, it might be even harder to convince YOURSELF to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/20-work-from-home-relatable-memes-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">work from home</a>. Trust us, we know!</p>



<p>So we thought we&#8217;d list down some of the ways we motivate ourselves to work from home, even when we don&#8217;t want to! Because let&#8217;s face it, the guilt of not working, clubbed with the anxiety of work piling up through the days is a tougher path to navigate than actually sitting down to work.</p>



<p>So push the quilts away, make a nice cuppa and get to work, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/health-wellness-tips-from-reddit-users-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you lazy bum</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Stop thinking about how much work you have</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s some advice for all the winter procrastinators in the work from home era &#8211; stop substituting any real work with to-do lists!</p>



<p>Shush that inner monologue that keeps yapping about how much work you have, how you&#8217;ll never get on with it, and the many time management skills you lack to make it happen. Trust that once you begin, the satisfaction of ticking things off your to do list on your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work desk</a> will make up for the time you spend away from your bed!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Baby steps; you&#8217;re a grown-up now</h2>



<p>You&#8217;re not a baby anymore. You sure wish you were, when everything was done for you, and people had to work for you instead of the other way around. But one thing that we can learn from our baby days is to take tiny, baby steps whenever we feel stuck in our adult lives.</p>



<p>Check your work from home to-do list for loopholes. Do you have ambiguous or long term tasks laid down in their entirety? If yes, break them down into doable baby-sized tasks.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Begin somewhere</h2>



<p>Another challenge of working from home and dreaming of conjuring up time management skills, instead of getting to work is that you still get no work done and waste so much time in the process.</p>



<p>So push thoughts like &#8216;omg when am I going to finish my work&#8217; away, and acknowledge the fact that there is no finish line, especially when you work from home!</p>



<p>So just start somewhere! Block an amount of time and start work on the task you would enjoy the most &#8211; or something that&#8217;s easy. Addict yourself to the ticks on your to-do list and you&#8217;ll be working through it like the total boss you are!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. But it&#8217;s so boring, and Netflix is asking me whether I&#8217;m still watching!</h2>



<p>Think about it this way &#8211; you&#8217;d never have anything to watch if people didn&#8217;t get up and get to their tasks with proper time management skills. Even in a seemingly exciting world of entertainment such as a Netflix job, there must be some very boring tasks that people needed to do to get that content out to you. So take inspiration from Netflix if that&#8217;s holding you back, and get to work!</p>



<p>If a job is extra boring and you just don&#8217;t want to do it, make it exciting for yourself! <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-tips-to-stop-hating-your-job-all-the-time-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop saying you hate your job</a> and focus your energy on the positive aspects &#8211; like working in your PJs!</p>



<p>Take advantage of the work from home lifestyle, put on some good <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13JaEgvqDn2i1B4M5JzkJZ?si=FNrft5AJRV-GG-8JigATFQ" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">music you can head bang to</a>, and get clicking or typing. The one good thing at the end of all of this is &#8211; you can get back to Netflix right after!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Think about the rewards!</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of making lists like we are, here&#8217;s something you might like to do when you work from home:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><em>Make a solid time management schedule.</em></li><li>M<em>ake a list of the number of reasons why you need to get the task at hand done.</em></li><li>P<em>roceed to list down how you&#8217;ll feel when you&#8217;ve finally done it.</em></li><li>M<em>ake a list of the activities you can enjoy or the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-comedy-movies-to-watch-when-you-hate-your-job-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">movies you can watch</a> once you&#8217;ve done it.</em></li></ol>



<p>Be strict and don&#8217;t reward yourself until you complete what you have to. If there&#8217;s a lot to do and it will take weeks to finish, learn more about time management and make a plan that allows you small rewards for small tasks everyday and a BIG reward for when it&#8217;s finally all done.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Now stop reading articles online already and start working!</p>



<p>Okay, just one more article, you say?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We all have our own unique understanding of what success means and who successful people are. Although many of us attribute success to money and fame, the path to success is unique for all. We can blame this notion on how we get to know the story of successful people in the first place. As a straight-A student with a shiny university degree, you may well be successful, but that&#8217;s not always a guarantee. </p>



<p>Simply put, all we need is <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-expert-tips-on-making-a-career-change-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fresh take on success</a>. Most stories of successful people have trained us to believe that without &#8220;proper&#8221; education, our chances of success are slim. Yet we see many examples of successful people who weren&#8217;t bright students &#8211; and many who didn&#8217;t even finish school!</p>



<p><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/249961" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walt Disney, Elton John, James Cameron, Frank Lloyd Wright, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs all have one thing in common.</a> Apart from being famous and successful people, they&#8217;re all school/college dropouts. </p>



<p>Here are some inspiring stories of famous people who were not so successful in school.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Cameron Diaz</h2>



<p>The star of Bad Teacher and The Other Woman, Cameron Diaz, has had one of the most consistent acting careers. She became famous with 1994&#8217;s &#8216;The Mask.&#8217; She roughly made $200 million with a low budget film. And retained her Forbes&#8217; Top-Earning Actress title 20 years later, and the &#8216;successful people&#8217; title in our collective consciousness. Did you know that Diaz had a challenging school experience and dropped out at 16 to pursue a modeling career?</p>



<p><strong><em>So as the story of successful people goes: if you have a dream, by all means, pursue that dream!</em></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Drew Barrymore</h2>



<p>A successful actress-turned producer/business person, Drew Barrymore had a tragic past, not unlike most successful people. Drew was almost nine when her parents split. She began going to nightclubs with her mum 4-5 times a week. Inevitably, she ended up in rehab at the young age of 13 after which she decided not to continue school. She starred in films like Donnie Darko and 50 First Dates. And later became one of Hollywood&#8217;s top best-known actresses after facing all these odds. Drew is also an Ambassador Against Hunger for the UN World Food Programme. </p>



<p><strong><em>Here&#8217;s the lesson from this story of successful people! Overcoming toxic parental issues and building a life from scratch is possible!</em></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. John Lennon</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-verse">''You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one''
-John Lennon</pre>



<p>Yes, we&#8217;re talking about a story of successful people that practically everyone knows! Lennon received the title of the 5th greatest singer of all time by the Rolling Stone Magazine. But it wasn&#8217;t all good, and he wasn&#8217;t a top achiever either. </p>



<p>He was a troublemaker at school and failed the O-level examinations.  After being accepted into the Liverpool College of Art with incredible difficulty, he soon gained a reputation for disrupting classes and being undisciplined. </p>



<p>He even failed his exam and was thrown out of the college. Later in life he became one of the most successful people in the 60s up until now. He formed The Beatles and had 25 number-one singles on the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/list/5901102/john-lennon-10-biggest-billboard-hits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US Billboard Hot 100</a> chart as a writer, co-writer or performer.</p>



<p><strong><em>So no matter how you act out when you&#8217;re facing adversity, keep your art alive! </em></strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Sir Richard Branson</h2>



<p>When Richard was young, he was diagnosed with dyslexia. But now he calls dyslexia his &#8216;greatest strength.&#8217; Richard Branson is perhaps the most famous school dropout in recent history of successful people. He left school at the age of 16 to start a magazine called &#8216;Student.&#8217; After starting this successfully, his headmaster said, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Congratulations, Branson, I predict that you will either become a millionaire or go to prison.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote>



<p>Branson later formed the &#8216;Virgin Records&#8217; and the &#8216;Virgin Group,&#8217; an amalgamation of hundreds of companies. He also created the &#8216;Virgin Atlantic&#8217; worth about $6 billion. Looking back on the headmaster&#8217;s comment, Branson said, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;That was quite a startling prediction of him, but in some respects, he was correct on both counts!&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>



<p><strong><em>So as this story of successful people goes, the aim is to not let any &#8216;shortcomings&#8217; hold you back when it comes to going after what you want in life!</em></strong></p>

<p>So you can fail a couple of exams, or college completely, and still be successful. We are not saying that flunking college is a recipe for success, but it is not the end of the world. You still have a future, and many opportunities in life will come along. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Michael Jordan aptly said, &#8220;I have missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300 games. On 26 occasions, I got entrusted to take the game-winning shot, and I missed it. I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.&#8221;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Successful people rarely have a smooth run. You can argue that the preconditions for success are hurdles along the way that help you build resilience, strength, and deep fortitude.</p>
