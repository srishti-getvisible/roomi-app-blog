<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Pensacola</h2>



<p>As far as nicknames go, Pensacola has many! It&#8217;s been called home to the world&#8217;s whitest beaches, for its white sand beaches (naturally). It also bears the name &#8216;Cradle of Naval Aviation&#8217; for the first Naval air station of the US Navy in 1914 under which many naval aviators including Neil Armstrong and John H Glenn received training.</p>



<p>Other nicknames include &#8216;Western Gate to the Sunshine State,&#8217; &#8216;Emerald Coast,&#8217; &#8216;P-Cola,&#8217; and even &#8216;America&#8217;s First Settlement!&#8217; Pensacola was in fact the first American settlement! Although the city was discovered 5 years earlier than St. Augustine, Pensacola was destroyed by the hurricane soon after, thus losing its fame as the first settlement.</p>



<p>And with the miles of coastline and crystal clear bay areas, along with feats of human civilization, Pensacola offers the best of both worlds: A sleepy beach town vibe <em>and</em> a bustling city life!</p>



<p>Not only that, but if you&#8217;re planning to find rooms for rent in Pensacola, you&#8217;ll be happy to know that the city <a href="https://www.cityofpensacola.com/1200/About-Our-City" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">boasts the shortest average commute</a> time in the country: Only 19 minutes!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Jax to its friends, this youthful city in Northeast Florida occupies a huge area, the largest of any in the contiguous United States. So, you can soak up the big city energy downtown, watch the Jaguars at TIAA Bank Field, walk the riverfront and hop across the river aboard the Jacksonville Water Taxi. But also, you&#8217;ll find some of the most ancient artifacts in the country have been discovered in the Timucuan Preserve. You thought we were done? There&#8217;s still more! Some of the best things to do in Jacksonville also include gigantic protected spaces with wetlands. Then there&#8217;s the forgotten plantations and eerie beaches where maritime woodland has been overcome by the Atlantic.</p>



<p>With vaccinations rolling and the state of things looking optimistic, we&#8217;re all looking for something to do outside of the confinement of our homes. So, here&#8217;s Roomi&#8217;s guide to some of the best things to do in Jacksonville, FL!</p>

Great hiking trails, different ecosystems, wildlife (turtles everywhere!), streams, and a beautiful and peaceful pond covered in lilies. The arboretum is pet-friendly and a great outdoor spot for a family hike.</p>

<p>You can’t come to Northeast Florida without&nbsp;learning how to surf. But you don’t want to go out to the pier at Jax Beach and embarrass yourself, right? That’s where these surfing lessons come in.

They are kind and patient and will get you on your board in no time, even if you&#8217;re feeling nervous. Jacksonville has a close-knit surfing community that’s a wonder to be a part of, with a surf that&#8217;s one of the most underrated in the region.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://cattyshack.org/"><strong>Catty Shack Ranch Wildlife Sanctuary</strong></a>&nbsp;is a nonprofit dedicated to providing a forever home for endangered big cats. They’ve also taken on a commitment to teaching visitors about big cats (as well as a few foxes, coatimundis, and bobcats). They offer daytime tours, as well as exciting night feedings. This one&#8217;s bound to be one of the best things to do in Jacksonville if you&#8217;re a cat lover. This place is really special as it is currently housing 29 leopards, cougars, and tigers. It’s definitely a great opportunity to get up close and personal with big cats in a way that’s not attainable at the zoo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tours begin at 1:00 PM and leave approximately every 30 minutes. Tours last about 45 minutes and you are encouraged to ask questions of the guide as he or she tells you about the animals. Following your tour, you are free to wander on your own as time allows and revisit the animals. We also have a concession stand with an assortment of drinks and select food items available. The last tour leaves at 3:00 PM and we close the entrance gate at 3:15 PM. The facility is mostly packed dirt or grass, accessible to wheelchairs and strollers. Bring your camera and take as many pictures as you like!!&#8221; — <a href="https://cattyshack.org/tickets/">www.cattyshack.com</a></p>

<p>Dinner here is always an early affair, and is always followed by a show to catch. Cowford Chophouse takes anyone who walks in, back in time, almost seamlessly.</p>



<p>The restaurant pays tribute to history, taking its creative notes from the Roaring Twenties. The art deco-inspired illustrations and typography for the menus are stunning, and the bar’s mixologist has crafted a dozen signature cocktails that update martinis and old fashioned. <br><br>The dinner menu follows the model created by other signature steakhouses, the meat playing a starring role with dozens of shareable a la carte options for starters and sides. Choose your entrée, or more notably the size of your entrée first, and then build the rest of your meal. Cuts of meat can start as small as a 4-ounce portion of A-5 Satsuma Wagyu to a 40-ounce Porterhouse. Service is impeccable and waiting staff will help you navigate the optional add-ons as well as the rest of the menu. If you arrive early or want a less formal dining experience, head to the rooftop bar for river views and sunset.</p>

<p>This is one of those hearty restaurants where you don&#8217;t (and probably shouldn&#8217;t!) look at the calories when you&#8217;re ordering. At Maple Street Biscuit, the peppered gravy with thick chunks of sausage swamps a fried chicken breast topped with melted cheddar and pecan wood-smoked bacon all sandwiched between a flaky, buttermilk biscuit. It’s knife-and-fork heaven on a plate.</p>

<p>Finding rooms for rent in Sarasota can be a treat for those that appreciate modern architecture. Otherwise known as Sarasota Modern, this is a regional style of post-war modern architecture (1941–1966). It also emerged on Florida&#8217;s Central West Coast, in and around the city of Sarasota, Florida!</p>



<p>These buildings are characterized by open-plan structures, often with large planes of glass to facilitate natural illumination and ventilation. These are essentially meant to address the unique indigenous requirements of the regional climate. Many of the architects who pioneered this style became world-renowned later in their careers. And several significant buildings remain in Sarasota today!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top neighborhoods in Sarasota</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Laurel Park, Downtown: </h3>



<p>Looking for history combined with walkability? If so, finding rooms for rent in Laurel Park in downtown Sarasota may be the answer! In 2008, this neighborhood was also named a National Register of Historic Places District. The neighborhood is filled with single-family homes, duplexes, and also small apartment buildings. Many of them date back to the 1920s, in styles such as a bungalow, Mission revival, Colonial revival, and Mediterranean revival. Residents also run the spectrum from professionals to artists and young families to retirees. And of course, not to mention the many pets that reside here.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gillespie Park, North: </h3>



<p>While it may not be for everyone, Gillespie Park is a neighborhood on the upswing. You&#8217;ll mainly find renovated 1920s bungalows here. But also ranch-style homes from the 1950s and 1960s, small apartment buildings, as well as a smattering of new constructions that make the neighborhood just north of downtown an interesting mix. </p>



<p>Named in honor of Sarasota’s first mayor, John Gillespie, the neighborhood’s centerpiece is a sprawling park of the same name. They also boast a lake with a refreshing fountain. The neighborhood has a diverse population base, thus bringing together renters and property owners. It’s also a quick walk to the shops on Main Street.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lakewood Ranch, East of Trail: </h3>



<p>This sprawling planned community east of Interstate 75 on the Sarasota-Manatee county line offers something for everyone, from townhouses to million-dollar-plus estate homes. You’ll find everyone from young families to empty-nesters living in the seven villages that make up Lakewood Ranch. You’ll also find recreation ranging from playgrounds to pools to polo, with half of the 8,500-acre community set aside for open space and recreation areas, including miles of hiking trails. Several village centers have been established, so there are plenty of shopping and dining opportunities close to home. Lakewood Ranch also has the distinction of being a green community, and since 2005, all new construction is required to follow Florida Green Building Coalition standards.</p>

<p>Living here offers anyone who finds rooms to rent in Sarasota an urban-suburban mix feel. While most residents own their homes, a lot of these homes are turned into student rentals. In Sarasota, there are a lot of bars, restaurants, coffee shops and parks. But the highlight, of course, is the beautiful beaches that have become one of the many reasons why people choose to go to school and spend 4 years in Sarasota.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are the top universities in Sarasota!</h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How transit-friendly is Sarasota?</h2>



<p>Sarasota, for a fairly small city, has a great transport structure. Traffic is almost always manageable but you might need an actual vehicle to get places, as walking and biking aren&#8217;t always convenient. Here&#8217;s everything else you need to know about how transit friendly Sarasota can be!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Walkability</h3>



<p>Sarasota (made up of 51, 917 residents) has an average Walk Score of 53 &#8211; it has some public transportation and is somewhat bikeable. The most walkable Sarasota neighborhoods are Main Street Merchants, Gillespie Park, and Rosemary District.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Roads &amp; traffic</h3>



<p>The traffic in Sarasota is not bad at all during the summer and fall. But when the snowbirds and tourists are here, which is January through mid-April — traffic can be heavy. However, traffic levels still don&#8217;t compare to the chaotic roads of bigger cities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Taxis</h3>



<p>Several taxi companies service the Sarasota area, with all rides starting with a $3 drop charge on top of a per-mile rate of about $4. Cabs can be hailed at the airport, on the street, or arranged through your hotel concierge. Additionally, ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber are bookable in Sarasota County via their respective smartphone apps.</p>



<p>Some of the most used cab services, besides Uber and Lyft, in Sarasota include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong><a href="http://www.yellowcabofsarasota.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellow Cab of Sarasota &amp; Manatee</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="http://www.taxicabssarasota.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Night Ride</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="http://gotataxisarasota.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Got a Taxi</a></strong></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Public transport in Sarasota</h3>



<p>One of the easiest and most affordable ways to travel in Sarasota is by bus. Known locally as SCAT, the Sarasota County Area Transit service costs $1.25 per one-way ride or $2.50 per ride on the Express Route 100x, which travels between the airport and downtown Sarasota. One-way fares are paid in cash on board the bus, but visitors can also purchase a one-day, seven-day, or 30-day bus pass for $4 to $60 each. All tickets are sold at the Downtown Transfer Station, the SCAT Transit Administration, or various Goodwill stores throughout Sarasota County.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Airports in Sarasota</h3>



<p>The major airport in the area is Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport which is shared by Sarasota and Manatee counties. Before it opened in 1941 to become the major airport, Lowe&#8217;s Field functioned as the main airport for the Sarasota Area from 1929 to 1941. There are five airlines that offer service out of the airport to locations primarily in the United States and Canada.</p>



<p>St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport and Tampa International Airport are located about an hour north of Sarasota. There&#8217;s also Southwest Florida International Airport in Ft. Myers, which is an hour and 45 min south of Sarasota. All three offer a wide range of national and international flights.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cycling in Sarasota</h3>



<p>If you don&#8217;t plan on venturing too far while in Sarasota, consider renting a bike. The city does not offer a public bike-share service, but several bicycle shops supply rentals, and many attractions provide free bike parking. Some bike stores charge by the hour, while others have daily or weekly rates. Expect to pay less than $10 per hour, $10 to $60 per day, or $40 to $250 for each week. Most bicycle stores include helmets, locks and chains in their rental rates. Some of the best places to find a bike rental in Sarasota include:</p>

<p>While the entire Gulf Coast is abundant with award-winning beaches, Sarasota’s 35-mile stretch of sand and surf boasts some particularly stunning gems. Six keys (barrier islands) hug the coastline, all with gleaming-white, sugar-soft sand and glorious sunsets, but each with its own distinctive vibe. And like many Florida beach towns, Sarasota’s keys quiet down quite a bit in late spring when the snowbirds head north for the summer.</p>



<p>Some of our favorite Sarasota beaches include:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Longboat Key:</h3>



<p>This 12-mile island features resorts, beach cottages, and seaside hotels. But there are also established residential areas with lovely homes alongside the intracoastal canals that lead out to the open Gulf. This is a quaint downtown district, with an exciting buzz of restaurants, shops and beach bars.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lido Key:</h3>



<p>Easily accessible from downtown Sarasota, Lido Key offers three main beach areas. North Lido Beach is somewhat secluded, with limited parking and no amenities. Lido Beach is a popular destination for tourists and locals looking for a relaxed but lively setting, with restrooms, concessions, and a public pool.
