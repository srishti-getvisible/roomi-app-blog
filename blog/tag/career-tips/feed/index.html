										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Looks like work from home is here to stay. And no one is complaining! We all are adjusting and adapting to the new normal. Which involves looking for online jobs, whether you want to leave a toxic work place behind, or just want to switch your job. Or maybe you&#8217;re fresh out of college and want to enter the professional world. Nonetheless, we&#8217;re all somewhere on the same field. And we&#8217;re looking for legitimate stay at home jobs that pay well and allow us some peace of mind too.  So here&#8217;s a detailed guide on how to find legitimate stay at home jobs. Along with some companies that help look for the right job, such as <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">we work remotely.</a></p>



<p>Now that most of the population is desperately looking for legitimate online jobs to sustain themselves amidst a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic</a>, unfortunately, scammers have a new market to explore. So when you&#8217;re looking for stay at home jobs online, you need to be extra cautious and take certain measures to protect yourself and your career.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Things to keep in mind for stay at home jobs and offers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Email address</h3>



<p>When a legitimate employer contacts you, they&#8217;ll do so with a legitimate company ID, (<strong>x@companyname.com</strong>) So if you get an offer for stay at home jobs from a personal Gmail, Yahoo or Hotmail ID, that&#8217;s worrisome and you should not trust the job poster.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Job description</h3>



<p>Another way to find out if a company is legitimate is if the stay at home job offer has a detailed job description that matches what you do for a living. If the job description is too vague. Or maybe it offers a job you&#8217;re not trained for. And they propose to train you on the job, then it&#8217;s probably a job scam.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Personal information</h3>



<p>A surefire way to spot a job scam is when a potential employer asks for your personal information such as your social security number, your bank details etc. during, or right after the interview even before they hire you. Just make sure you never give out personal details on an interview call for stay at home jobs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Application fee</h3>



<p>This is probably one of the most obvious ones. But sadly, people who really need a job, and are not well versed with how the online world works, can get trapped into an employment scam like this. A company will ask for a nominal fee so they can interview you, or hire you. THIS IS THE REDDEST FLAG YOU WILL EVER SEE. No job can require you to pay so you can get hired. No matter what they say, do not ever pay a company to hire you. It always works the other way around.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How should you find legitimate stay at home jobs?</h2>



<p>When looking for legitimate stay at home jobs, it&#8217;s always a good idea to find them on legitimate websites that allow <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/must-have-skills-for-individuals-seeking-remote-jobs/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">job seekers</a> and posters to come together and find the perfect match.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Social platforms</h3>



<p>LinkedIn is your safest bet. You can filter your search options to find stay at home jobs, and find legitimate employers and organizations easily.</p>



<p>Facebook and Instagram have also become budding job seeking and posting portals. You just need to be scrolling at the right time, and at the right place, and you never know, you might just find the perfect job.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use remote job portals to find stay at home jobs</h3>



<p>Other remote job portals work best when looking for stay at home jobs, such as Upwork, Fiverr, We Work Remotely, etc.</p>



<p>We personally love We Work Remotely! Apart from legitimate postings for stay at home jobs, they also <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/remote-work-resources" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">have plenty resources</a> to help you learn the art of stay at home jobs better.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Apply For internships</h3>



<p>Internships are a fantastic way to gain experience in the field that youâ€™re interested in. College career services are often able to help students find and apply to internships. Make sure your resume is polished before applying to an internship.</p>



<p>Apply to as many internships as you can &#8211; thereâ€™s no such thing as too much experience. Internships also have the potential to lead to future employment!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Join clubs and other extracurriculars on campus</h3>



<p>Building your resume is about more than just work experience. Employers want to know about who you are as a person and what makes you special. Do you have a hobby or special interest? Join a club on campus! There are often numerous clubs available for students on college campuses.</p>



<p>Volunteering is also an awesome way to boost your resume and is a super important career tip on our list today. Find a cause that youâ€™re passionate about and research volunteer opportunities near you. Many volunteer opportunities are now available online as well! </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Last career tip on our list &#8211; Do your research!</h3>



<p>Itâ€™s okay to not know what job you want after you graduate! Donâ€™t stress; all college students are in the same boat.</p>



<p>Utilize as many resources as possible in order to obtain as much information as you can. Take career quizzes, research jobs, and talk to people related to the field youâ€™re interested in. For example, want to work in marketing? Research online what kinds of jobs are available in marketing in order to see if one would be a good fit for you.</p>

<p>To clarify, changing jobs is moving to a similar position with a different employer and is usually relatively easy. Changing careers is a more in-depth shift and usually means moving to another industry, which requires an entirely different perspective. A career change usually means additional learning, retraining, and beginning a new career path from scratch.&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hobby-clubs-and-classes-in-new-york-where-you-can-meet-new-people-part-3/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">It isn&#8217;t easy and requires a leap of faith&nbsp;and a bit of bravery.</a></p>



<p>It&#8217;s never too late to make a career change. The timing needs to be right, with a strong foundation and a plan to move ahead. The hardest part is convincing yourself that you&#8217;re ready to do it â€“ <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-signs-time-move/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">and that you CAN do it</a>! To make a meaningful change, we want to highlight the preparation required. The suggestions here will help in preparing you for your career change. Are you ready?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-decide-where-you-want-to-go-next">1. Decide where you want to go next</h3>



<p>Take time to decide on what you would like to do next. It pays to know who you are, what makes you happy, and your strengths and weaknesses. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/7-career-tips-for-college-seniors-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Have you considered freelancing or starting a business?</a> Ask yourself some key questions to understand the direction you want to take.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-upgrade-your-skillset">2. Upgrade your skillset</h3>



<p>Check if you have the right skill set to move forward to mold your passion into your career. Suppose you have decided to become a freelance web developer. Can you code? Do you need to enhance your skills before forging a career? Do you require a web development course and need to build yourself a portfolio before making it your full-time profession? If you&#8217;re considering a move into data analysis or data science, enhancing your skillset with an <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">introductory R course</a> can be incredibly beneficial. The ability to handle complex analyses and large datasets is crucial in these fields. This course offers foundational knowledge that can serve as a stepping-stone for further learning and career advancement in various data-related tracks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-find-a-mentor">3. Find a mentor</h3>



<p>Having a mentor in your field can prove invaluable at this time, more so if you want to start your own business. Listen and follow your mentors closely, and don&#8217;t assume that you know everything already. As they are ahead in your field, build a relationship with them where you can ask them a zillion questions to clarify things in your mind and learn from their experiences.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-grow-your-network">4. Grow your network</h3>



<p>You may be eager to get out of your current job as quickly as possible. Still, handing in your resignation too soon could prove disastrous. Begin by building a support network while you&#8217;re at your current job. If you plan to freelance, your existing network is your best link to your future work. Use your contacts and build a relationship with people who might be of help. One meaningful way to move ahead with a successful career change is to realize that you don&#8217;t have to do it alone.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-you-are-your-own-brand">5. You are your own brand!</h3>



<p>You are your own unique selling point. Many people ignore this, but you can use your Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter to contact other professionals in your field. What you&#8217;re essentially selling here is trust to your clients/ customers in a market that seems brand new to you. Feel free to reach out and ask people in your area for help or advice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-set-your-goals-write-a-plan-of-action">6. Set your goals/ Write a plan of action</h3>

<p>It is a good idea to work backward. Outline your goals for the year detailing out your aims for the upcoming six months, and the following six weeks. Your first goal is to set yourself goals. Write daily objectives &#8211; small things you want to achieve over the next few months to get you out of your job and into a better career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many people look at failing in a negative light. But it&#8217;s important to remember that failure means that you&#8217;re trying. To err is human; no matter how successful you get, be assured that you&#8217;re still going to make mistakes. So it&#8217;s okay to make career mistakes too &#8211; we all do it!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I&#8217;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I&#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.&#8221;</p><cite><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Being mindful about career mistakes and learning from them will bring you a step closer to personal growth and success. Many people with high-pressure jobs spend their entire careers geared towards reaching their desired position but end up dreading their career journey. If you&#8217;re struggling at work, have just began your career or know someone who&#8217;s feeling stuck at work, continue reading. Here are some of the biggest career mistakes you can avoid (or make them and lean from them!)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Letting another person make your career decisions = biggest career mistake!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/HozfRdy8Qe4hVsbkk2" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/HozfRdy8Qe4hVsbkk2/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Each person is unique with their own set of experiences, thought patterns and preferences. You might turn to your best buddies for an outfit approval while shopping or you might seek approval from your parents when you&#8217;re making a big life decision but remember that it&#8217;s YOU in the end who has to deal with all consequences- good or bad. When it comes to your career, it&#8217;s natural to consult your core group, but don&#8217;t let your inner voice drown out. Trust your gut and find your inner voice of reason and make that voice your priority.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Not being able to balance your personal &amp; professional life</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/111LSMM1ICPqBq" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/111LSMM1ICPqBq/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>We usually spend eight to ten hours of our day at work &#8211; maybe more &#8211; so it&#8217;s understandable that some of us might make work our identity. Before your career takes an all assuming role, remember that finding balance in life is like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. A healthy life comprises of a good balance of work, family, friends, and mental health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. A perception that once you choose a field, you are stuck with it forever is one of the most common career mistakes</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:42%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l4FGquSwfx52EPXzO" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FGquSwfx52EPXzO/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Many of us think it is impossible to switch career paths after training and gaining experience in a particular domain. If you want, you can gradually transition to other fields. In today&#8217;s digital world, you&#8217;re subconsciously learning new things through social media, so focus on marketable skills and keep your eyes open for opportunities of your interest. You never know what you can achieve.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Burning all bridges</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6v4VaKAwgmLoA" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/6v4VaKAwgmLoA/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>It might seem right to sever all contacts and say good riddance when switching to your new career. Whatever be your reason for moving on, and whether you had a good experience or a bad one, keep networking with your old employer, you never know when you will require their help or reference.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Assuming you&#8217;re indispensable</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:53%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/HFHovXXltzS7u" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/HFHovXXltzS7u/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Never think of yourself as indispensable &#8211; feel grateful that you have the opportunity to contribute at work. Nobody is bigger than the organization and its goals. If you are not contributing, you might be a burden to the company. One example is Uber, where the founder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/technology/uber-travis-kalanick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Travis Kalanick was forced to resign</a> in 2017. Don&#8217;t know about you but it can be difficult for some folks to avoid career mistakes such as this one! Esp. if you&#8217;re a workaholic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Talking bad and gossiping is the worst career mistake out there!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT9KVuimKtly3zoJ0Y" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9KVuimKtly3zoJ0Y/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>The &#8216;mean girls&#8217; approach just doesn&#8217;t cut it at work. Avoid negativity at the workplace, and at all costs, avoid gossiping &#8211; negative things bubble up very quickly, noise gets created, and you will be found out sooner rather than later. Never ever jeopardize your relationship with anyone in your current organization. The industry is such a funny place, you&#8217;ll not even know when your current manager will be your lead in your forthcoming career path, OR your future plans might not fall in place, and you might have to take help from your current employer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. To choose your dream career, look into your hobbies</h2>



<p>Want to know how to find the perfect career path for yourself? Firstly, you&#8217;ll need to ask yourself a few questions. For example, how do you like to spend you free time? What are you good at? Do you prefer working with your hands or your mind? Do you like being around people? Love to coach kids/people? Like to interact with nature? Love numbers and puzzles? Or maybe you like to write? Perhaps you like playing  a certain kind of video game? Love to talk to an audience?</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Your skills and interests point to your career, although they may be a few steps away and not visible right now. You may love to coach a young team of kids, but it does not necessarily mean that you should become a professional coach. However it indicates that you have excellent leadership skills and that which can be applied in a variety of job roles. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Does your idea of success and your dream career match?</h2>



<p> What do you value in life? For example, do you want a lot of money or own fancy cars and houses or do you want free time? Do you value fun at work or having a large family or following a dream? Do you love to be in the city or the country? Love to live overseas or in the suburbs? we&#8217;re asking because answers to these crucial questions will help you zone in what your dream career looks like. If you love fast cars and are living in the hills, then you probably have to choose a job among them. Your inner passion will bring out the value of the work you will do and will help in finding the right career path for you. So, if you&#8217;re struggling with how to find the perfect career, this can be very helpful in figuring out what you want.</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. What kind of life do you want?</h2>



<p>So, when you think about your future, how do you picture yourself? Do you see yourself living an ordinary life where perhaps you settle down young and start a family in the suburbs? Or do you see yourself living an adventurous life where your career takes you just about anywhere in the world, and you keep your bags permanently ready and packed? As an adventurous person, you might want to be a wildlife photographer, traveling to dangerous places with your camera. In order for you to narrow down to your dream career, it&#8217;s important to visualize yourself in the future living the life you want.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Are you willing to compromise?</h2>



<p>You will not have much free time if you are young, an investment banker or a corporate lawyer, getting paid big bucks. But as an airline pilot or truck driver, you will be spending lots of time outside the home. On the other hand, you will have to study for a long time and get your Ph.D. if you want to become a college professor. As a famous actor/actress, you have to slog it out in front of others who may judge you according to your talent and looks. Does that sound like the perfect career path for you?</p>

	</div>
	


<p>What is it that you are willing to sacrifice? A music band breaks up because some members realize that they are are not willing to sacrifice their time for those endless on-the-road gigs to get famous. Some realize late in life that they are not willing to sacrifice their time even in exchange for fat salaries. These are painful discoveries once you have settled and trodden down your dream career path. If you want to know how to find the perfect career, you&#8217;ll have to have these tough conversations first. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Which subjects were your favorite at school?</h2>



<p>Which subjects in school are the most fun to you? Do you hate science and math and love English? If yes, then your perfect career path probably won&#8217;t be a doctor, scientist, engineer or economist. You might end up with a communication-based career such as a writer, lawyer, teacher or the like. Analyzing what fits you is a first step to determining your dream career. Finding the right career isn&#8217;t so hard after all!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Proactive attitude</h2>



<p>If you want to know your dream career choice intimately, you need to to be self aware and start by understanding yourself. If you&#8217;re just starting finding the right career path for you, try the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Informational interviewing â€“ talk to somebody who&#8217;s doing your dream job. So, pick up the phone and find out what&#8217;s right for you!</li><li>Summer jobs â€“ a great way to get to know what your job will be like because they provide you with hands-on experience that lets you see what type of environment you do or donâ€™t want to be working in.</li><li>Internships â€“ the best way to test out a career is by getting to work for a company for some time. You get to check the â€˜real worldâ€™ to see the environment, culture, and politics of your chosen career. So, check <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.internqueen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Intern Queen</a> for a variety of internships.</li><li>Career tests â€“ discover your strengths and interests. Some of the best career tests are <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://careersoutthere.com/career-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Myers-Briggs<strong>Â®</strong> MBTIÂ® personality type assessment</a>, StrengthsFinder 2.0, and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://careersoutthere.com/career-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iStartStrongTM inventory</a>.</li><li>Volunteer work â€“ This allows you to do a good deed while getting work experience that you might not otherwise get. The experience can uncover skills and interests that you might be unaware you had. Moreover, it helps you expose yourself to a wider variety of people and broadens your network.</li></ul>

<p>So you just had a job interview and you did everything you could. From <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/five-tips-to-spruce-up-your-resume/1516/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sprucing up your resume</a> to making sure you looked your best- you did everything to the best of your abilities. You took the time out to sharpen your professional skills before you even applied for the job. You were prepared for all the interview questions and came across as confident and trustworthy. It ended with &#8216;Thank you, we&#8217;ll get back to you&#8217;. But it&#8217;s been an hour since you left the interview room and patience is running out by the minute. Come night time, and you can&#8217;t sleep thinking about what you should and shouldn&#8217;t have said. </p>



<p>You might feel tempted to get up in the morning and call or email your interviewer asking if you got the job. But you worry if they don&#8217;t reply, you might end up being even more stressed out.</p>

<p>What you need to do, first of all &#8211; is calm down! The truth is, you gave it your all, and your interviewers might be busy. You&#8217;ll probably get that job; remember that it could all take longer than you expected. And of course, we all know &#8216;good things come to those who wait.&#8217;</p>



<p>But if you&#8217;re thinking what the heck you&#8217;re supposed to do while you wait, we&#8217;ve got your worried back.</p>



<p>Read up on our top tips to handle the anxiety and do something productive with your time while you wait to hear back from your job interview.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Don&#8217;t stop looking for the next job interview</h2>



<p>The not-so-easy to accept truth of the matter is, your interviewer might be doing the same thing. They might have a couple of interviews lined up (yes, even after YOU showed up).  And they will come to a decision only when they&#8217;ve gone through all the job interviews with the shortlisted candidates.</p>



<p>Instead of constantly worrying about and praying to hear back, you should keep applying to and exploring other <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job opportunities</a>. If finances are the main worry, you should also look for side hustles to stay safe and get another source of income as soon as you can. This might even distract you from the previous interview since you&#8217;ll be busy looking at other company profiles and preparing for interviews with them. Plus, the more interview questions you answer, the better you get at it!</p>

<p>If you fear your skills might soon be outdated, take this time to<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/sharpen-your-professional-skills-in-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> improve your skills</a>. It&#8217;s never too late to sharpen your professional skills! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. What job interview? Read that fat book. </h2>



<p>While a job is essential to survival, it&#8217;s not the end-all and the only purpose of life. There&#8217;s a vast world out there waiting for you to engage your curiosity. If you&#8217;ve been putting off a great book that you always wanted to read but had no time for when you were working &#8211; NOW is the time!</p>



<p>If you come to like the book, you&#8217;ll easily be distracted from the anxiety of waiting to hear back from the job interview. Apart from killing time, reading a good book will help you transcend into another reality that might have vast knowledge to offer on the way. And maybe, it&#8217;ll help you prepare for interview questions the next time around. </p>



<p>If you need some help, <a href="https://www.hannahbrenchercreative.com/blog/quarantinereadinglist" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here&#8217;s a great list of books</a> you can check out!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Play hard to get</h2>



<p>Okay you&#8217;re done with the job interview and the million different interview questions. Now, it&#8217;s a good idea to send your interviewer an appreciation email for taking out the time to meet you. Just resist the urge to send multiple follow-ups, which can end up annoying your prospective employer.</p>



<p>So it would work best for you if you don&#8217;t email or call them repeatedly or check-in immediately. Play it cool. (even if you aren&#8217;t)</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Commence online detective work</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re eagerly waiting to hear back from a job interview, and there&#8217;s nothing else you can focus on, put your time and energy into researching the company. After all, if you are daydreaming about getting a positive reply, you should know how to respond when that call finally comes in.</p>



<p>So after you sigh at your daydreams, be the digital Sherlock Holmes you are and uncover whatever you can about the company: its employees, its products and services, and whatever else you stumble upon. Plus this is a great way to sharpen your professional skills. If your profession is being a world class spy. </p>



<p>This research will help you determine where and how you fit into the company and whether you would indeed be happy if you were to join. </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Meditate</h2>



<p>Calm down your anxious mind with meditation. Whenever you feel tempted to refresh your email app a zillion times or check your phone every minute to see if they&#8217;ve responded, deny yourself the panic-stricken joy. Lie down in a dimly lit area in your house and focus on your breath. Let the thoughts come in and go as they please. Choose not to interact with them. You&#8217;ll find a much-needed sense of calm and sail through with lesser effort that panic requires you to put in. You&#8217;ll also find that meditating helps sharpen your professional skills. It&#8217;s magical!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 unleashed a load of unexpected change in all our lives. The pandemic altered and disturbed the natural course of our professional and academic growth, slowing down our skills development and practices. This has rendered many of us feeling doubtful about our future. Most of us are spending time moping and hanging on our phones all day, trying to figure out life until we can begin living normally again.</p>



<p>Take it from us: it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way! Many students and graduates are adding to their professional developmental skills using all their free quarantine time. If you&#8217;re feeling up to it, why not see what you can achieve? (We can see your mom nodding approvingly at the back). So here&#8217;s a list of professional skills that can boost your job opportunities and help you use your precious quarantine time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-fix-your-resume">1. Fix your resume!</h2>



<p>When was the last time you updated or fixed your resume? This task is probably the most procrastinated of &#8217;em all. The quarantine may be a great time to dust it off; a professional resume needs a different kind of treatment compared to a high school resume.Â <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/cv-format-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Your professional resume must entail</a>Â skills, projects, and experiences aligned with your goal. If your goal is to become a copywriter, make sure to include any experience and skills that support your goal. Add class projects, internships, research, new skills, and student involvement in your resume. There are some great tools like Canva, visme that offer awesome templates for free and will sweep your interviewer off their feet because they not only help you in getting your first interview but with the help of such interactive content creation tools you can make your interview assignment look even more appealing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-build-your-online-presence">3. Build your online presence</h2>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re a writer, digital marketer, data analyst, or web designer â€“ your online presence can help you get more clients and work. Here are some practices that will help you do so during quarantine:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linkedin-nbsp">LinkedIn&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Get your LinkedIn profile up to date using the content from your resume.&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/how-to-make-your-profile-stand-out-on-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revamp your LinkedIn profile to stand out</a>; choose a great photo and invest in LinkedIn Learnings. All of these efforts are worth it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-media-platforms">Social media platforms</h3>



<p>Businesses around the world are leveraging top platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to build and maintain their presence. You, too, can <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/10-steps-to-building-your-personal-brand-on-social-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harness social mediaâ€™s strength</a> by presenting your work and connecting yourself with like-minded individuals/businesses. Using tools like an <a href="https://murf.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI voice generator</a>, you can create engaging audio content to complement your posts on these platforms. These low-cost platforms can enable your work to be seen worldwide and noticed within your personal network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-website-nbsp">Website&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Another great tool to display your portfolio is via your own site. A neat and user-friendly website can speak volumes and scream, &#8220;I am so professional, I have a website, you guys!&#8221; Some popular user-friendly sites include&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wix.com/html5en/in-hiker-create?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2-G7jLOO6wIVVwQrCh0UKQfnEAAYASAAEgIQVPD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wix</a>,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://webflow.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=general-paid-branded&amp;utm_term=keyword-targeting&amp;utm_content=branded-ads&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5LLMw7OO6wIVSgwrCh2O_gMmEAAYASAAEgLWTPD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Webflow</a>, and&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wordpress.com/create/?v=india_go_to_market&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=google_wpcom_search_brand_desktop_in_en&amp;utm_medium=paid_search&amp;keyword=wordpress&amp;creative=329641414965&amp;campaignid=683204332&amp;adgroupid=31861711621&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;targetid=kwd-313411415&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9JzB2bOO6wIVzBErCh3EwgxtEAAYASAAEgI2UfD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-new-professional-skills-learn-a-new-language">4. New professional skills: Learn a new language</h2>



<p>Being fluent in a second language adds extra oomph to your resume. This valuable skill can also help you get job placements in your dream state/city. Learning a new language needs patience and time, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-places-to-learn-a-new-language-online-for-fre.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">some great mobile apps</a>&nbsp;are making this process easy and fun, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duolingo&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.babbel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Babble</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Troubling to some, exciting to others, there&#8217;s a persistent question that comes around no matter what stage of life we may be tackling. It&#8217;s the question of planning your future, planning your career. This thought could surface in discussion with friends, your family, a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/answers-to-6-most-common-job-interview-questions-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job interviewer,</a> or your brain at 3 am. One of the biggest reasons that the majority of us don&#8217;t like to think about the future, or come up with a career plan for our future, has been backed by science. </p>



<p>Studies suggest that our <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/04/why-people-are-so-bad-at-thinking-about-the-future.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brains think of our future selves as strangers.</a> But this doesn&#8217;t mean we should let ourselves off the hook. In fact, it gives us an opportunity to think about our future selves with empathy and care, like we would other people.</p>



<p>We know it&#8217;s tough, and we&#8217;ve mostly come to associate this superhuman skill with the highest achievers, justifying to ourselves that we&#8217;re not one of them. So to make things easier, we&#8217;ve listed a few things you could think about to think about the future. It&#8217;s time to think about thinking about putting our thinking caps on! Yes, there&#8217;s quite a lot of thinking ahead.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506784850319-305956726452?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="person holding orange pen on to of journal beside Stabilo Boss highlighter, tracking her mood on a self made mood tracker in her journal, as she takes on her career plan"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Have a plan, but also, don&#8217;t have a plan</h2>



<p>Sounds confusing? Because it is! When you think about the future, the first thing that might come to mind is to make a plan that you could follow.</p>



<p>Maybe two years back, like a lot of us, you made a plan to travel the world in 2020. You know what we&#8217;re getting at. Plans tend to fail or get postponed. So don&#8217;t set rigorous timelines to whatever it is that you plan to do, whether you&#8217;re considering personal development or professional development backed by a career plan.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a clichÃ© because it makes sense to focus on your journey instead of your destination. Do that, and you&#8217;ll forget to ask, &#8216;Are we there yet?&#8217;</p>



<p>So have a general plan outlined, and fill in the colors on your beautiful and fulfilling journey as you go along.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Work for the tomorrow you want, today!</h2>



<p>If you wish to achieve a goal tomorrow, you have to start today! Maybe your career plan is to have your own business someday or have a job that gives you the freedom to travel. Whatever your dream is, wake up and start working towards it now. Put in the required amount of work for personal development and start becoming the person you want to be tomorrow from today. Like they say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t dress for the job you have, but for the one you want.&#8217;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Actively participate in your present to change your future</h2>



<p>Simply cribbing about your present and longing for a desirable future isn&#8217;t going to cut it. Everything you desire as a part of your professional or personal development has to be embedded into your life now. If you have some complaints about any current aspects of your life &#8211; maybe you have trouble managing your work hours, or perhaps you dislike the work you do for a living &#8211; it&#8217;s time to do something about it.</p>



<p>You need to start figuring out how and then start working towards eliminating what you don&#8217;t like. If it is out of your control, you could try changing your perception towards it. But your problems won&#8217;t disappear on their own, and your dreams won&#8217;t materialize on their own either.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Have someone to look up to</h2>



<p>One of the best ways for personal development is learning from other people. There is always something to learn if you look in the right direction. Make it a point to look up to someone you admire. Maybe it&#8217;s not someone who has it all, but someone who constantly works towards achieving what they need. It could be one of your friends, one of your relatives, your colleagues, or an inspiring TED talk. Let someone inspire you to become the best version of you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Don&#8217;t expect to know all the answers</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Because you can&#8217;t.</li><li>Life might become a very tedious ride if you have all the answers.</li></ol>

<p>The current coronavirus pandemic has changed the job market overnight. Offices expect to remain shut during the entire course of the Covid-19 pandemic. And we all adapted to new routines as the pandemic impacted job security, employment, and the economy. Among all the pain we witnessed globally, we at Roomi found ourselves wondering about the jobs that people lost. And by extension, the jobs that were in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why were certain jobs in demand during the Covid-19 Pandemic?</h2>



<p>According to new data from the US Department of Labor, the unemployment rate rose to 4.4% in the most significant one-month jump since 1975.</p>

<p>Julia Pollack, who works at ZipRecruiter, said that the current pandemic had created full-ranging roles. These roles are needed to contain the disease and increase American consumers&#8217; confidence. She noted that some positions would likely increase in popularity while compiling a list for CNBC.</p>

<p>However, a quarter of the American workforce has filed for unemployment benefits. Many brand new employment positions have sprung up and are in high demand. And these new jobs have been in demand since the Covid-19 pandemic hit us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The new jobs created during the Covid-19 pandemic.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">COVID-19 testers: a job in high demand.</h3>



<p>Test workers conduct swab tests at hospitals or nursing homes, and even factories and offices. Registered nurses and nursing assistants will qualify for the roles, and they can expect a pay of around $45 an hour. If one invests their skill in training, then these positions are open for them. We can expect this role to be in demand for quite a while. Especially as factories and offices will require constant testing during and after Covid-19, as we continue to fight this pandemic.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Interview <strong>question: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Answer: I see myself as a sincere, hardworking professional of society in the coming years.</strong><br><em>Me, in my head: (Sipping on margaritas, on an island far, far away.)</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Why do you want to work for us?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>A: You&#8217;re revolutionizing the industry, and I would love to learn from your work and help you with your mission.</strong><br><em>Me, in my head: (I&#8217;m broke and I need to get paid)</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Out of all the candidates, why should we hire you?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>A: Because I&#8217;m a team player. I&#8217;m a hardworking and self-motivated individual.</strong><br><em>Me, in my head: (I REPEAT, I AM MORE BROKE THAN YOUR OTHER CANDIDATES, AND I NEED MONEY!)</em></p>



<p>Feels familiar?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Common interview question 1: <strong>So, tell me a little about yourself</strong>!</h2>

<p>It always sounds so simple, but when asked at an interview, you always find yourself sitting there with the word &#8216;Umm&#8217; coming out of your mouth like a newborn.</p>



<p>Although some uses are natural, you need to avoid overusing the &#8216;umm&#8217; followed by the recitation of your resume; make yourself look like the professional you are.</p>



<p>The first step is to do your research on the company. Then think about the parts of your experience that could prove to be relevant.</p>



<p>Talk about how you reached your current work position and company, your ambitions when you were in college, and whether they are different now. This is a very common interview question where they seek to hear about your personal life experiences or reasons for gaps in your resume.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Question 2: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">

				</div>

	</div>
	


<p>Talk about your long-term goals with the company, what you intend to do while you work for the position offered to you, and how it will be relevant to your future goals. Moreover, be sincere and honest during the interview. If lying on the beach is where you see yourself in 5 years, tell them it would be on a business trip as a reward for the excellent job you would do!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Question 3: Why are you leaving your current job?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/XomTLpclNjd1S" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/L0IU2cW8sFw8V2UIfP?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fblog2.roomiapp.com%2F"></iframe>

	</div>
	


<p>First things first: If you were let go, it&#8217;s completely OKAY to admit it (especially now, with COVID-19 disrupting job sectors). Mention what didn&#8217;t work out and how you&#8217;ve been working hard to improve.</p>



<p>But if you&#8217;re leaving your current job, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-tips-to-stop-hating-your-job-all-the-time-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">DO NOT shine a negative light on your job</a>, employer, or colleagues. The interviewer is not your colleague or friend. Instead, you could say things like: your ideas and goals do not match with your current company/employer/projects. Don&#8217;t miss the opportunity during a job interview to talk about how you wish to explore new skills and opportunities to develop a more versatile portfolio.</p>



<p>Are you waiting to hear back after an interview? <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/do-this-while-you-wait-to-hear-from-a-job-interview-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here&#8217;s what you can do in the meantime!</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Question 4: Why should we hire you?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/4Fh0B2CCaickE" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/4Fh0B2CCaickE?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term="></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Remember that an interview is always a two-way street. So, list down your positive attributes that would benefit your employer. Then tell them about how YOU would benefit from the position.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Question 5: What are your strengths and weaknesses?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/egSqD74685gzK" title="https://giphy.com/gifs/egSqD74685gzK?utm_source=iframe&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=Embeds&amp;utm_term=https%3A%2F%2Fingilizce.org%2F"></iframe>

	</div>
	


<p>To tackle this trick question, frame your answer in a way that does not oversell or undersell your qualities as an employee.</p>



<p>Think of a quality that you honestly consider to be your <strong>weakness</strong> and add how you&#8217;re working to improve the said weakness.</p>



<p>Similarly, when it comes to your <strong>strengths</strong>, do not try to oversell. Think of something that caters to the needs of the position. Also, support your answers to tricky job interview questions with relevant and brief examples.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Question 6: Do you have any questions for me?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>This is an opportunity for you to investigate. Don&#8217;t let it go. Moreover, this is a common interview question they expect an answer for although it may seem otherwise!</p>



<p>No matter how badly you want a job, you need to protect yourself from toxic work environments, abusive employers, and work hours. So make a good list of things you would like to know and ask the most important ones. Some of them could be about their work hours, their office culture, and how a typical workday might look for you when you start.</p>



<p>You can enquire about the position â€“ whether it&#8217;s a new one; and, if it&#8217;s an old position, where did the previous employee move to, etc. You could also ask the interviewer how long they&#8217;ve worked there and their favorite thing about their work. </p>



<p>And to end it with a hint of vengeance, ask them where they see the company in the next few years! Be ready with your own job interview questions <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
