<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-public-transportation-how-to-get-around-san-francisco-without-a-car">Public Transportation: How to Get Around San Francisco Without A Car</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about the city&#8217;s public transportation system:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-muni-transit"><strong>1. Muni Transit</strong></h3>



<p>Muni is the most common way to get around San Francisco as its both the bus and metro system of the city.

<p>Whether you’re traveling across town or just down the street, be prepared for the occasional delay or unexpected sight, warn locals.</p>



<p>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-make-a-travel-budget-stick-to-it/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">How To Make A Travel Budget &amp; Stick To It?</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. BART and Caltrain</strong></h3>



<p>BART, or Bay Area Transit, is another popular public transit option run by SFMTA. It&#8217;s the country’s fifth busiest heavy rail rapid transit system. The&nbsp;BART&nbsp;connects the heart of SF with numerous cities in the East Bay and suburbs in the south. In 2023, there was <a href="https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2023/news20230729" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">48 million</a> ridership on BART, so it’s no surprise SFMTA has&nbsp;plans to update the trains&nbsp;to be cooler, more comfortable and less noisy.</p>



<p><strong>Roomi’s tips for travel:</strong>&nbsp;The locals have an unspoken code of conduct for BART riders (no eating on the train, keep conversations and coughs to a minimum, let people exit before you get on, and don&#8217;t take up too much space). Definitely something you should familiarize yourself with before you become&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;rider.</p>



<p>Finally, Caltrain is a another commuter train similar to BART. It’s perfect for traveling between San Francisco and San Mateo and Santa Clara. This is your best bet if you’re trying to get to Silicon Valley from SF. Whereas you might want to take the BART if you’re just going to Oakland.&nbsp;Fares for Caltrain&nbsp;vary depending on the zone you’re traveling between, the number of rides you need, and how you&#8217;re paying. Essentially, using a Clipper Card is cheaper than a physical ticket. It’s best to check before hopping on-board.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis and Ride-Sharing Apps</h3>



<p>Like in all cities, San Francisco also has its fair share of taxis (mostly downtown), and ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft. This may be one of the easiest ways to get around the city, it isn&#8217;t the cheapest.</p>



<p>The base fare starts at $4.15 with an additional $0.65 per one-fifth mile and each minute of waiting or traffic delay. The pick-up fee in San Francisco is also $5.50.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Ferry</h3>



<p>Ferries are a fun way to tour San Francisco. It allows you to go to the Ferry Building and have a spectacular view of the Golden Gate Bridge. There are also a lot of ferry services in San Francisco that can bring you to different places around the Bay Area:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Golden Gate Ferry: going to Angel Island State Park and Larkspur to the north</li>



<li>Giants Ferry: to Oracle Park</li>



<li>Warriors Ferry: to Chase Center</li>



<li>San Francisco Bay Ferry: going to Oakland/Alameda, Richmond and Vallejo in the East Bay</li>



<li>Alcatraz City Cruise: departs from Pier 33 to &#8220;The Rock&#8221; or Alcatraz</li>



<li>Blue &amp; Gold Gate Ferry: to Tiburon and Sausalito from Pier 41</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Cable Cars</h3>

<p>Another option to get around San Francisco is by cable cars. It&#8217;s a bit more historic, so cable cars have limited reach as compared to other modes of transportation. The cable car has three routes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>California Cable Car: Goes from Embarcadero to Van Ness</li>



<li>Powell/Hyde Cable Car: Goes from Powell and Market to Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf</li>



<li>Powell/Mason Cable Car: Goes from Taylor and Bay to Powell</li>
</ul>



<p>To buy tickets to Muni, Caltrain, BART, ferries, and cable cars, you can use a Clipper Card. It&#8217;s the all-in-one transit card in San Francisco that you can add to your Apple Wallet or Google Wallet, or order a physical card online for free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Going Around SFO The Healthy Way</h3>



<p>Perhaps the best news about getting around is SF is you can reasonably forgo all modes of modern transportation. The city is considered as a walker&#8217;s paradise with a 99 walk and biker score. It&#8217;s convenient to <a href="https://www.guruwalk.com/san-francisco">walk around the city</a>, with easily accessible stores and shops all around.</p>



<p>Further, San Francisco has an extensive system of bicycle paths and lanes. Some of which are parallel to traffic and shared with pedestrians — some that are completely separate from both. Thus, walking and cycling form as efficient tips for travel in San Francisco.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Traveling in San Francisco: Extra Hacks</h2>



<p>With all the transportation options, now it&#8217;s time to consider the actual places and things to do in the city. Here are a few extra hacks that can come in handy when traveling to San Francisco.</p>

<p>For a city that can get so congested with traffic, biking in San Francisco offers an alternate way to get out and around. Beyond this, it is a good sport and outdoor activity that can help you stay fit. Whether you&#8217;re just relocating or you&#8217;re staying here permanently, riding bikes in San Francisco is one of the best things you can do around the area.</p>

<p>Relatively easy. There are bike lanes all around the city. However, sometimes you’ll still find the lanes congested with Ubers and Lyfts &#8211; especially in areas where there is no separation of lanes. When this happens, consider other users of the road &#8211; such as a car that needs to park or turn &#8211; to stay safe. Remember that a bike lane that is not separated belongs to the community.</p>



<p>You may need to learn the basic bicycle thoroughfares in San Francisco. You can easily find them by following the street signs or <a href="http://SFMTA.com/BikeMap">a map like this</a>. Using the thoroughfare helps you avoid areas that are commonly congested for bikers.</p>

<p>Biking in San Francisco is generally safe. When you opt for a bicycle over a car, you’re actually choosing a statistically safer means of transport, with statistics showing that there are typically more car accidents than bike accidents yearly. Of the bike accidents that occur, most just involve the bicycle itself. Sometimes, the rider hits a pothole. Other times, they slip on a wet surface or get caught in a Muni track and lose control. In all these cases, the accidents are rarely fatal.</p>



<p>Practice caution and extra care while biking in San Francisco to keep yourself and others around you safe. For example, when biking in San Francisco on a wet day, you must watch out for visibility, and for slippery tires that can put you in danger. Make your riding even safer by wearing protective gear like a helmet (a legal requirement for under 18s), knee and elbow pads, etc.</p>

<p>Biking in San Francisco is something you can do anytime &#8211; whatever the weather. Of course, many prefer a clear day and mild weather to maximize comfort in the saddle. Try biking around in the dry season provided it is not too hot. When things heat up, drink plenty of water!</p>



<p>Comparatively, biking in San Francisco is considerably more difficult and dangerous when there is rain. It can become hard to stop, hard to see, and hard to maintain your balance. Consider leaving your bike at home and finding an alternative means of transport until the weather improves.</p>

<p>The same road signs apply to both cars and bikes. If there’s a car at the stop sign already, by all means, stop too. If there isn’t, you can follow the suggestions of Chris Roberts, a rider in San Francisco. He said, “As a rule of thumb, treat stop signs as yields, and red lights as stop signs.”</p>



<p>What this means is that if there is a car coming, yield to them by waving at them, and acknowledging them. This way, they know you’re aware of their presence (and they also become more aware of yours). If it is a pedestrian already on the cross walk, you may want to stop. However, if you can’t afford to stop abruptly, ensure you cut behind them. This way, even if your bicycle startles them, their panic won&#8217;t let you make a mistake and hit them.</p>

<p>You absolutely do. Especially in months like November, December and January when it usually gets darker earlier, biking without lights can be dangerous. If you ever find yourself riding out late without a light, exercise total caution and use major bike thoroughfares to get home safe and sound.</p>



<p>It helps to prepare for dark, rainy days by installing a bike light. White lights should go to the front of your bike while a red light should illuminate your rear end. Switching the lights can confuse motorists and other cyclists and could lead to accidents.</p>

<p>The possibility exists but you can reduce the chances of losing your bike to theft. If biking in San Francisco is on your to-do list, begin by registering your bike with the city. This is free.&nbsp;Even if someone makes off with it, the chances are high that you&#8217;ll get it back</p>



<p>You can also buy a U-lock and lock the wheels and bicycle frame to any bicycle rack or street-sign pole which are common around San Francisco. Some riders even go as far as using a special cable lock to safeguard their seats to the frame. In any case, don’t forget to ensure your bicycle against theft, too.</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Valencia Street</li><li>Golden Gate park</li><li>Crissy Field and Marina Boulevard</li><li>Angel Island Loop</li><li>Baker Beach Coast Trail</li></ol>
