<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting to know San Antonio</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a reason why San Antonio is the most visited city in all of Texas. The city has a <a href="https://www.dmagazine.com/sponsored/2020/02/explore-the-immersive-art-food-and-culture-scene-in-san-antonio/" class="broken_link">thriving art scene</a>, some of the most stunning colonial architecture in the country and, of course, Tex-Mex food. Of course, like the rest of Texas, San Antonio also has a subtropical climate. Which means the winters are quite pleasant but the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/a-summer-skincare-guide-to-healthy-skin/">summers</a> are excruciatingly hot. Oh well, the vibrant culture more than makes up for it!</p>



<p>It’s home to five-time NBA champion San Antonio Spurs. On top of that, it also hosts the annual San Antonio Livestock Show and Rodeo! This city really knows how to have fun.&nbsp; So, the question isn’t <em>if</em> you should move to San Antonio, but <em>when</em>!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How transit friendly is San Antonio</strong></h2>



<p>San Antonio commute is actually quite a pleasant experience. The city is fairly easy to navigate, the traffic isn’t too bad and there’s some quirky transportation options available for you. Here’s how you get around the city!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>Walkability</strong></h3>



<p>San Antonio is not the most walkable city in the world. Most people here drive to get around, which is by far the easiest and the most convenient. However, Downtown San Antonio is quite walkable with a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/score/san-antonio-texas">Walk Score</a> of 96!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Roads/traffic</strong></h3>



<p>The average one-way commute time in San Antonio, 24.1 minutes, is actually shorter than the natural average. It might take some time to get used to the freeways and suburbs, but, that’s what Google Maps is here for!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taxis</strong></h3>



<p>While Uber and Lyft are popular options, you can also use <a href="http://yellowcabsa.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellow Cab</a><strong>.</strong> Keep in mind, it’s a little hard to find cabs on the street. You can also try the river taxi. Yes, that’s right, the city has a river taxi! <a href="https://www.goriocruises.com/Cruises/river-shuttle/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Go Rio</a> has river-taxis that run along the Downtown Reach and Museum Reach sections of the River Walk daily from 10am to 9pm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Public Transportation </strong></h3>



<p>Public transportation isn’t the most popular option here, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have any viable options! The <a href="https://www.viainfo.net/">VIA Metropolitan Transit Service</a> offers regular bus services at the extremely reasonable fare of <a href="https://www.viainfo.net/rates/">$1.30</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Airports </strong></h3>



<p>The San Antonio International Airport is just 10 miles away from the center of the city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cycle-Friendly</strong></h3>



<p>The city has a public bike-share program called the <a href="https://sanantonio.bcycle.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">San Antonio Bike Share</a><strong>.</strong> It’s great for short trips around the city!</p>
