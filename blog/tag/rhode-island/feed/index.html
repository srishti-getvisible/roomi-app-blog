<p>Getting around Providence is a breeze. The city is compact enough to be highly walkable, but offers excellent public transport as well. If you can avoid the usual traffic bottlenecks, and find a good place to park, you can take your car out without any worries.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Walkability </h3>



<p>With a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/RI/Providence" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk score of 78,</a> Providence is a highly walkable city where you can complete most errands on foot. The most walkable neighborhoods are Downtown Providence, Fox Point and Federal Hill.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Roads/traffic</h3>



<p>If you’re planning on getting around with a car, keep in mind that parking spots are hard to come by. Overnight parking isn’t allowed in the city, however, during the day, you can park your car at the Westin Hotel or Providence Place Mall if you’re willing to shell out a few extra bucks.</p>



<p>The city is usually busy, so you will experience some traffic throughout the day. Expect more delays if there’s traffic near I-95 as that can lead it can lead to more back up traffic in Downtown Providence, and the city itself.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Taxis </h3>



<p>You can easily catch Uber or Lyft services when in Providence, or opt for a taxi service. Taxi fares are affordable, with a base fare of $3.50, and an additional $2.50 for every mile. The waiting charge is $30.00 per hour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Public transportation</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ripta.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority</a> provides public transport services in Providence. Although the public transit system is comprised entirely of buses, when you are in Downtown Providence, you can hop on the Providence LINK trolleys, which run on natural gas.</p>



<p>You can buy e-riptiks, or get ride passes on-board or through any local Stop N Shop.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Airports </h3>



<p>The <a href="http://www.pvdairport.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TF Green Airport</a> located in Warwick is the closest airport to Providence. It provides regular and affordable domestic flights. The <a href="https://www.massport.com/logan-airport/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boston Logan Airport</a> is an alternative option for those looking to fly to international destinations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cycling</h3>



<p>Providence is fairly bike-able due to its compact size. However, there aren’t many dedicated bike lanes or any safety measures in place for cyclists on the road. Recently, Providence’s Department of Planning and Development has announced the <a href="https://www.providenceri.gov/planning/great-streets/#:~:text=The%20Providence%20Great%20Streets%20Initiative,healthy%2C%20inclusive%2C%20and%20vibrant.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Great Streets Initiative</a> which aims to improve Providence’s bike-friendly status. This initiative would introduce two-way bike lanes for cyclists, as well as on and off-road paths along with enhanced signage at intersections.</p>
