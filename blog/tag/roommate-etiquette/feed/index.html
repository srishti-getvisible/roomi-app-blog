<p>It is cheaper and a lot more convenient to do your laundry at home, this is usually a fun and smooth process but it can be different when there is shared laundry in an apartment, basically sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment. This is an <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.chicagonow.com/medium-rare/2016/04/moral-dilemma-in-the-laundry-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">unending chore</a> and it should be fun and done right. Below are some laundry room etiquettes one should follow for a happy coliving experience! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Laundry Room Etiquette 101</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cleanliness</h3>



<p>Keep the laundry room tidy, especially when it’s a shared laundry in an apartment. When there are spills, you clean it up and clean out the lint trap, change it after every use and throw away drying sheets and empty detergent wraps. There’s potential for a mess when sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment but can be kept to a bare minimum with intentional efforts like cleaning thoroughly after use. If not done properly, it can cause slipping hazards and in the case of spilling bleach, it can ruin someone’s clothes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Time</h3>



<p>Maximize your time so you don’t waste other’s time. Don’t monopolize the machines. Please don’t leave your dirty clothes sitting in the washer or dryer while someone else is waiting for a machine in a shared laundry in an apartment. Time your laundry, you surely do not want someone else removing your clothes and placing them on the machine or your clothes getting dirty by being tossed aside or collecting mold from being left in the washer for too long.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reservation</h3>



<p>You can’t reserve a machine in a shared laundry in an apartment when you are not ready. Being busy is not an excuse for reserving a dryer if you are not actively using a machine especially when you are sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preparation</h3>



<p>Sorting out your clothes for laundry saves time. treat stains in advance this helps to maximize your time so you don’t leave others waiting for a machine. You can get a <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/laundry-detergent-bag.html">different bag for your detergents</a>, softeners, and dryer sheets for easy access.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Respect</h3>



<p>Respect everyone’s space and belongings, ask to be sure if someone is using a machine so you don’t cause an awkward situation also do not monopolize the machines. Use a timer to ensure you get your clothes out on time so you don’t keep your neighbor waiting. This is very essential in a shared laundry in an apartment. This is to avoid being on bad terms with your neighbor. Don’t use someone else’s hamper without permission even if you are sharing a washer and dryer in an apartment and if you know you’d be late in getting your clothes, write a note and leave your laundry basket/hamper by the machine so the next person can help you place them neatly.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Patience</h3>



<p>Try to be patient when you notice that a washer or dryer has completed its cycle and the owner is not yet there to pack their clothes, never move anyone’s stuff if you can help it. You don’t want to have issues with someone’s personal belongings. They’ll be back soon. If they don’t return in time and you absolutely have to use a machine, it’s a good rule of laundry room etiquette to wait at least 10 to 20 minutes to see if the owner of the clothes is coming back for their laundry. After the time elapsed and their basket is present, gently place the laundry inside of it.</p>

<p>Roommate etiquette forms as a base to healthy relationship boundaries while co living. Whether you grew up sharing a room with your siblings or you&#8217;re an only child with a bedroom all to yourself, living with someone new can be challenging. As exciting as it is to move into a new apartment and forge new friendships with your roomies, it is equally important to know where to draw the line and maintain some privacy.</p>



<p>Here are some steps you can take to make sure that co living with your roomie is a fabulous experience that you can cherish for a lifetime.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roommate etiquette 101: <strong>Establish Boundaries</strong></h2>



<p>Most people have trouble co living with others because the people they are living with lack any sense of boundaries. Setting healthy relationship boundaries with your roomies is the best way to make sure that you can maintain a pleasant and non-hostile atmosphere. Communicate with them early on regarding how you want to live, what your boundaries are and especially what your pet peeves are. </p>



<p>While everyone has to adjust and compromise when co living with other people, that doesn&#8217;t mean that you need to live in an environment where you don’t feel comfortable. Communicate!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Respect personal space</strong></h2>



<p>Once healthy relationship boundaries have been established, make sure you respect them! Don’t go barging in on your roomie if they&#8217;ve made it clear that they want to be left alone. Similarly, don’t put up with it if someone else is invading your personal space. Make sure you respect their time, space and boundaries &#8211; and that they respect yours. This is the secret of successful co living!</p>



<p>If your roomie does something you don’t like, speak up! At the same time, if your roomie tells you that you overstepped the line, don’t take offence. These things are bound to happen in the beginning, just apologize and do better next time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lay down ground rules</strong></h2>



<p>Setting some ground rules are a part of roommate etiquette and healthy relationship boundaries. They can co living a 100 times easier to navigate and a lot more comfortable. </p>



<p>Don’t want loud music disturbing you when you’re trying to go to sleep? Set quiet hours when no one can be loud and disturb others. Hate seeing dirty dishes in the sink for days on end? Create a schedule and <em>reasonable</em> time frame within which all the chores should be done. Do not want an endless parade of guests going in and out of the house? Set up a rule with your roomies on how many guests are allowed in your home, especially if someone wants to throw a party.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have some &#8216;me&#8217; time while co living</strong></h2>



<p>Now that you&#8217;re living with others, it&#8217;s even more important to set some time aside when you can be alone. Even though it does not come under roommate etiquette as such, but is still important at an individual level. </p>



<p>Having some ‘me’ time, while co living is essential for your mental health and well being. You can go for a run, read a book, watch movies, bake, get (or give yourself!) mani-pedis&#8230; the list is endless! The point is to do what relaxes you and makes you feel rejuvenated. Just make sure you tell your roomies when your ‘me’ time is, so that they don&#8217;t disturb you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Create your own safe haven</strong></h2>



<p>When you are co living with someone else, there are not a lot of places you can go within the house to be alone. Roommate etiquette includes feeling comfortable in your space. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to have a designated spot that acts as your safe haven in the midst of communal living.</p>



<p>If you have your own room, creating your haven is a lot easier, but if you don&#8217;t, no worries! Just pick a corner and turn it into your safe space! This can be a study table or a gaming corner, the choice is yours. This is one of the most fun parts of living on your “own”, you get to create and decorate your own space!</p>

<p>While it’s true that sharing resources and supplies is inevitable to a certain extent when you&#8217;re co living, don&#8217;t depend on your roomies for all your supplies. This could possibly be one of the quickest ways to sour your healthy relationship boundaries with them!</p>



<p>Instead, you should take care of your own supplies and take note if you&#8217;re running out. Have a weekly/monthly schedule for shopping for essentials such as groceries, medicine, and household supplies. Make sure you and your roomies are on the same page about which supplies are communal and which are personal so none of you impose on the others.</p>
