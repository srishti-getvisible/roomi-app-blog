<p>From affordable living, <a href="https://www.nascarhall.com/" class="broken_link">NASCAR Hall of Fame</a>, and a love for the Carolina Panthers, the Queen City is a unique place to live in. Here’s why people are racing to find rooms for rent in Charlotte.</p>

When talking about the Queen City, it is hard to dodge references to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, or the delicious sweet tea that the state is famous for. However, Charlotte is a melting pot of diverse cultures, and has a lot to offer its residents.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability in Charlotte</h3>



<p>With a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/NC/Charlotte" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">walkability score of 26</a>, Charlotte is one of the least walkable cities in the US. It ranks 49th among the largest cities in the US in terms of walkability, meaning that it is a car-dependent city. Some neighborhoods like NoDa, South End and Uptown Charlotte are more walkable than others. Depending on where you find rooms for rent in Charlotte, you may need a car to complete your chores.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Roads/traffic in Charlotte</h3>



<p>Traffic in Charlotte can be quite slow, with congested roads, especially during the rush hour. On average, cars move at about 15 mph; you can expect to sit in your car for long intervals when trying to get anywhere.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis in Charlotte</h3>



<p>You won’t be hard-pressed to find taxi services in this city and the best part? They’re affordable as well. The base fare is $2.50 with an additional $0.50 for every kilometer, and a waiting fee of $30.00 per hour. A flat fare of $25 from Uptown to the Airport and vice versa also makes it easier to rely on them when you need to go anywhere. Alternatively, you can also opt for Uber and Lyft if you’re looking for online options.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public transportation in Charlotte</h3>



<p>Although Charlotte is a car-dependent city, if you don’t have one, you won’t be left stranded. The city’s rail, streetcar, and bus system are quite efficient as well. The <a href="https://lightrail.uncc.edu/using-light-rail#:~:text=The%20LYNX%20Blue%20Line%20operates,campus%20107%20times%20each%20day.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">LYNX Blue Line Light Rail</a> is reliable and runs every 15 minutes during non-peak hours on the weekdays, and every 7.5 minutes during rush hours. On the weekends it runs every 20 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes during late-night hours. You can use the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://charlottenc.gov/cats/bus/Pages/mobile-apps.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CATSPass app</a> on your mobile phone to buy your $2.20 pass easily.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://charlottenc.gov/cats/transit-planning/gold-line/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CityLYNX Gold Line</a> is Charlotte’s streetcar system that connects the eastern and western parts of the city, allowing residents to travel to the business and educational district easily. Enjoy free rides every day of the week.</p>



<p>You can also opt for the <a href="https://charlottenc.gov/cats/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlotte Area Transit System</a> Bus service, which has over 70 routes across the city. When trying to get from the Airport to the city center, you can also opt for the <a href="https://www.charlottecentercity.org/transportation/sprinter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sprinter Bus Service</a>, which is a hybrid electric bus system that runs every 20 minutes on weekdays and every 30 minutes on the weekends.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Airports in Charlotte</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.cltairport.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlotte Douglas International Airport</a> serves the city and is quite well-connected. Passengers can hop on a cab, Uber, or a bus straight out of the airport and reach the city center at affordable prices. If you’re a tourist, you won’t have too much trouble navigating into the city from the airport.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Cycling in Charlotte</h3>



<p>Bike-sharing systems such as <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.spin.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spin</a>, <a href="https://mobike.com/global/" class="broken_link">Mobike</a> and <a href="https://www.li.me/" class="broken_link">LimeBike</a> are a few of the several bike-sharing programs in the city. Even if you do not own a bike, you will not miss out on the fun. Although using the bike-sharing programs is easy, and residents have the freedom to drop off the bike in any legal location they want, the city is not quite bike-friendly. Even with extensive bike-sharing programs, the city is sorely lacking in bike-friendly infrastructure, making most roads dangerous for bicyclists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you can expect to pay as rent in NYC is greatly dependent on how much money you make and how much of a sucker you are. JK, income doesn’t matter that much, you’ll probably over spend any way. The general recommendation is that rent should be no more than </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.lendkey.com/resources/how-much-of-your-income-should-you-spend-on-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your income. Thus a monthly income of $5,000 should strive to pay no more than $1,500 (5,000 x .3)/month. NYC is very much about give and take. And since the city has a lot to offer, it has no qualms with taking. Keep in mind, while you do want to live comfortably in the city, committing to apartments in New York over your budget is a guaranteed way to get into debt. Here is how much rent you can expect to spend from each </span><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.nycgo.com/boroughs-neighborhoods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC borough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bronx</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Yankees, Botanical Gardens, and the Bronx Zoo are some undeniable built-in amenities the Bronx offers along with art deco to marvel. Between Morris heights and University Heights the average rent in NYC is $1350/month.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Queens</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A personal fav- <a href="https://bit.ly/2QmdcDO" class="broken_link">Queens</a> is the epicenter of international cuisine. From authentic Greek in Astoria to Flushing’s Chinese fair, this borough is for New York&#8217;s foodies. This and a few other reasons may be why it is a little costlier to rent in NYC Queens than Brooklyn. With a recent 5% increase, median rental price in Queens is $2,550 ( for a studio). With all the outings to be enjoyed, this is a great place to shack up with roommates. That way you have more money in your pocket for ALL the gyros. </span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://bit.ly/2QmdcDO" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Brooklyn</a></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes no more than a single visit to be convinced to live in Brooklyn. My first walk along Brooklyn Heights Promenade is all it took me. To be near the live street music and dining scene and average rent in NYC will be $2,400/month for your own pad in Brooklyn. Or do what I did and have house mates, cutting this cost into thirds. Having roommates afforded me to live in the city of my dreams without drowning in the cost.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Manhattan</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason people romanticize Manhattan and it has nothing to do with Sex and the City. Manhattan is home to Time Square, Broadway, and pretty much everything food and entertainment, and of course great apartments in New York. Among the concrete jungle there are even hidden green spaces.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://bit.ly/2QmdcDO" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Staten Island</a></strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forgotten borough&#8230;coming in at an impressive rent average rent in NYC of $1300/month for a 1 bedroom. New Yorkers should be ashamed of ignoring the island. Yes, it is a pain in the ass to take the ferry to get to the city, but there are so many other goodies that make up for the trek. Did I mention rent is actually affordable? Beyond this, Staten Island is much less crowded. </span>A<span style="font-weight: 400;">nd </span>it&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">perfect if you’re a nature lover. The most affordable borough may cost you travel time, but you won’t hear your bank account complaining. </span>Moreover, o<span style="font-weight: 400;">ne lesson NYC taught me was to work harder and spend smarter. Be reasonable with your expectations and budget when window shopping apartments in New York City. Regardless of the four walls you choose to sleep in, you’re still in the big city.</span></p>

<p>In cities where rent control reigns, housemates can hope to find some security in an unpredictable housing climate. But in Washington State, rent control is <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=35.21.830" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">illegal</a>. This means even if your landlord can’t increase the rent during the lease term, they&nbsp;<em>can</em> set the rent price to whatever they want for the next leasing period. So when <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hunting apartments</a> for rent in Seattle, you’ll need to know what’s allowed, what’s not allowed and how to win over landlords like a pro. Here’s what experts say about finding affordable apartments for rent in Seattle and locking them down.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Apartments for Rent in Seattle: 101</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rent Control and Rent Stabilization</h2>



<p>Rent control is a strict regulation of rent, and it’s a rare and precious thing for few cities. It’s impossible to rent a rent-controlled apartment now. Because once the original tenant vacates it, the unit most often becomes rent-stabilized. Rent stabilization controls rent in a manageable way for both renters and landlords. </p>



<p>This usually applies to buildings built during a certain time period (1947 to 1974 in NYC, for example). Moreover, relies on the state of the&nbsp;local economy and inflation to regulate the allowable percentage increase on rent. This allows landlords to increase rent to keep up with the market without doubling to tripling it overnight.</p>



<p>Sounds great for renters, right? Well, it’s also a highly controversial issue, especially in Washington, where the politicians are split on the subject. Many believe it wouldn’t make a difference in making apartments for rent in Seattle more affordable and that rent control is a “failed economic policy.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What experts say</h2>



<p>Chuck Hattemer, CMO and co-founder of OneRent.co, says that while rent control might look good on paper, it poses new challenges for property owners and renters alike in notoriously rent-controlled areas <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/tips-travel-get-around-san-francisco-like-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like San Francisco</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The primary issue we see is that owners of rent-controlled units have little to no incentive to perform maintenance or upgrades on their units on a regular basis,” he explains, comparing current events in San Francisco to a hypothetical rent-controlled future for Seattle.</p><p>“Maintenance costs are unregulated, and therefore the numbers just don’t make sense if you wanted to invest $5,000 into renovations but can only raise the rent 1.6 percent and earn an additional $200 a year or something along those lines.”</p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Seattle rents drop amid COVID-19 pandemic as apartment incentives increase" width="1250" height="703" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ve0QUSDezcY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Hattemer argues that the lack of rent regulations in Seattle is a more beneficial system, allowing investors to renovate old or undesirable buildings to market levels, and charge the standard rent. And the renters?</p>



<p>“For a certain portion of the population, they’re OK with rent raises because they know (and expect) that the owner will invest in improving their unit in order to match a higher rate,” he says. A Slippery Slope. So where does that leave renters? On a slippery slope, to say the least. Though the lack of rent control essentially frees up the housing stock, it doesn’t help in a tight rental market. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview of rent control in Seattle </h2>



<p>According to Seth Stephens, a professional landlord at Renters Warehouse of Seattle, there is a lot to consider when you hit the local rental market — the first being a shortage of supply.“ The biggest hurdle facing the Seattle area is lack of homes on the market and the cost of them,” he says. “A quality home is being rented in a matter of hours or days with multiple applications, making it tough for tenants to find that perfect home.” </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/the-panozzo-team-thepanozzoteam-thepanozzos-the-panozzos-U6v5T7a8dsSSNn79Jv"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/U6v5T7a8dsSSNn79Jv/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C270&#038;ssl=1" alt="Uh Huh Writing GIF by thepanozzoteam - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="270" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>That’s not surprising, considering the vacancy rate in the area can vary from as high as 4.6 percent to as low as 1.4 percent, depending on the neck of the woods you’re renting in. And availability is just one of the issues.“ The average two-bedroom rent in Seattle is $2,400 monthly,” Stephens continues. “As you get into the surrounding areas, you see those prices drop, but it’s still not exactly affordable.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deeper insights on rent in Seattle</h2>



<p>These are some of the reasons local renters have been crying out for the return of rent control in the last few years. In a market based on inflation and government-regulated control, the rent might be more adaptable, and so would the renters. </p>



<p>As it stands, Stephens says that owners have had to catch up to the market, and tenants looking for apartments for rent in Seattle may very well be suffering because of it.“ We’re seeing many owners who have had tenants for three to four years and have no idea the market is up $300 to $800 monthly,” he explains.</p>

<p>Considering a month-to-month tenant must only be given a 30-day-notice before a landlord can raise the&nbsp;rent, it’s important to know a few key things about apartments for rent in Seattle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Negotiating, Communicating, and Rooming Up</h2>



<p>If you’re wondering what’s a renter to do in a no-rent-control-high-demand-low-supply market, don’t worry — you’re not alone. Here are some great tips to navigate the rental market in Seattle (or anywhere, for that matter).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1.&nbsp;Sign a Longer Lease</h3>



<p>According to the <a href="http://www.tenantsunion.org/en/rights/rule-changes-rent-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Washington Tenants Union</a>, in apartments for rent in Seattle, a landlord cannot change any aspect of a lease during the fixed-term period except by mutual agreement. So the longer your lease term, the longer you can hold onto a great deal. In many cases, landlords prefer tenants who are willing to sign longer leases because it offers them security as well. (More on that in the next section.)</p>



<p>And to really find a great deal? It’s all about getting in early, says Hattemer.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“You’ll want to look in areas that are still developing and on the up-and-up. This will mean that you can lock down a long-term lease in an area that is going to have lots of new development, job opportunities, new restaurants, new things to do, new public transportation, and more.</p><p>“To rent in Seattle specifically, look at neighborhoods such as North Queen Anne, Magnolia, or West Seattle.”</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Negotiate With Your Landlord</h3>



<p>Yes, this is totally allowed and <em>always</em> recommended. Apartment prices aren’t fixed, and you may be surprised at your bargaining power. Negotiate the rent&nbsp;before you sign a new lease. And before you resign an old lease, keeping in mind your strong suits.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Tenants who have low-debt-to-income levels, stable jobs, and good credit are still the ideal tenants for an owner. So taking care of your finances will help in negotiations,” recommends Stephens.</p><p>“The other part is your flexibility. If you can do a longer term lease, this will allow an owner to justify dropping the rent or being open to certain terms a tenant might want.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Keep in mind that landlords aren’t picky just for any reason. The better you present yourself, the better your bargaining power.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“It’s important that the renter demonstrates that they understand this property is an investment. And thus the owner is financially motivated,” adds Hattemer, who also reccommends offering additional incentives deposits for pets.</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Communicate With Your Landlord</h3>



<p>To rent in Seattle alone isn&#8217;t enough. Remember when we said landlords are human, too? Keep that in mind when trying to build a good repertoire.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“A landlord has two major concerns. They want rent paid on time and their home to be taken care of” Stephens continues. “If you can accomplish these two things, you can keep an affordable home. And also have a good relationship with the landlord.”</p></blockquote>



<p>And to ensure timely maintenance and a well-kept residence, it’s vital to keep your landlord up to speed about any issues.</p>
