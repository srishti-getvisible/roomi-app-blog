<p>Life with a&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-im-stuck-coliving-with-roommates-i-dont-like-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">roommate</a>&nbsp;isn’t always rainbows and butterflies — even we’ll admit to that. But when you have to share a space with someone, it’s vital to find a way to get along. Even if that means looking past the stack of dirty dishes&nbsp;or overflowing garbage can. But when the little stuff becomes too much to handle for one party, it can create palpable tension that can quickly turn toxic.</p>



<p>Good communication is the key to a healthy roommate relationship, but if you’re getting bad vibes without a clear reason why, you might have a serious issue on your hands.&nbsp;We talked to an expert on common behaviors of a passive-aggressive roommate and how to deal if you’re living with one.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-passive-aggression">What is Passive Aggression?</h3>



<p>Psychology professor and clinical psychologist&nbsp;<a href="http://psychology.nova.edu/faculty/profile/dorfman.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dr. William Dorfman</a>&nbsp;defines passive-aggressive behavior as a dishonest expression of anger and hostility — an indirect expression of feelings people don’t want to confront. The most serious implication of this behavior is that doesn’t directly solve problems but rather expresses resentment&nbsp;and disapproval, making it difficult to deal with or improve a situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-signs-of-a-passive-aggressive-roommate">What are the Signs of a Passive-Aggressive Roommate?</h2>



<p>Thirty-year-old blogger, Chloe, who prefers not to use her real name, knows what this feels like. She and a friend lived with a passive-aggressive roommate in a townhouse during her freshman year of college. She says their&nbsp;roommate regularly passive-aggressively found ways to be inconsiderate. Eventually, the situation escalated to the point they felt uncomfortable in their own home.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“He would leave messes, and we would have to clean up after him, but then he would complain about me to the third roommate or about her to me,” says. “It became very uncomfortable because we would end up just trying to avoid him to keep the peace. It was like the tension became our fourth roommate. It was this real thing that was always present. You aren’t home without comfort and feeling protected and safe. When that is stripped from you, you avoid home until it’s late. You have no peace, no comfort.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>While anyone can react to a difficult situation passive-aggressively, Dorfman says some consistent behaviors indicate it’s not&nbsp;someone simply blowing off steam.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“It’s inherently an interpersonal process and a personality trait.&nbsp;Sometimes, we even diagnose it in clinical psychology as a passive-aggressive personality disorder when it really characterizes a person, not just once in a while.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>To add, here are some common passive-aggressive behaviors that your roommate might exhibit along with strategies for dealing with them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-procrastination-on-chores">1. Procrastination on chores</h3>



<p>No matter how many times you ask your roommate to do something, they’ll make excuses until it becomes obvious that they’re not happy. They might&nbsp;say they’re going to do the dishes after you ask, but it never happens. Repetitive procrastination&nbsp;is likely an indication of not wanting to do something.</p>



<p>Dorfman says,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“We all procrastinate, but when you procrastinate with someone else, it affects the other person’s rights and they’re left with the problem.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-being-forgetful-and-late">2. Being forgetful and late</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive roommate consciously or unconsciously forgets what’s asked of them, or is constantly late. Lateness, according to Dorfman, is another way of saying &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take control of the situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>For example, you may ask your roommate to arrive home by a certain time so you can rest, but they’ll be late and say they forgot your request. Or they may forget that you asked them not to eat your food in the fridge. When your roommate makes it a habit&nbsp;to be inconsiderate, it can be a sure sign of passive aggressiveness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-silent-treatment">3. Silent treatment</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive roommate may also shut down when faced with conflict. Instead of talking about the issue, they express neither hostility nor honesty. Rather than negotiating to solve an uncomfortable situation, they give you the silent treatment.</p>



<p>Not talking, Chloe says, was one of the main issues in her roommate relationship. Looking back now, she says she’s more aware of what to look for.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“The person will either say nothing was wrong or lash out. Either way, I would try to bring a peaceful and calm environment to whatever forum you decide to have and just keep having communication lines open.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-actions-don-t-match-the-attitude">4. Actions don&#8217;t match the attitude</h3>



<p>Perhaps the most toxic passive-aggressive behavior is acting one way and feeling another. They come across as being insincere or “fake nice”. For example, your roommate might ask you to “pick up” some toilet paper from the store, but it eventually becomes a routine.&nbsp;Dorfman likens the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/coliving-101-help-my-roommate-talks-behind-my-back-roomi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">situation</a>&nbsp;to someone stabbing you in the back while smiling to your face.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“Often people who are passive-aggressive have an obvious, gratuitous attitude toward you that is not consistent with the way they act,” Dorfman says. “If you’re smiling at someone and being very sweet and friendly, how can you be angry?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-your-roommate-doesn-t-have-a-good-reason-to-be-angry">5. Your roommate doesn’t have a good reason to be angry</h3>



<p>Not every passive-aggressive roommate necessarily procrastinates or is stubborn and manipulative. The root of the behaviors of your roommate could also be that they don’t like being limited by others. Before jumping to conclusions, you should consider this first.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“If you’re not doing anything to instill or create any frustration or resentment, they don’t need to act in a passive-aggressive way,” Dorfman says. “It’s only when they’re called upon to do something or they’re not getting their way. Rather than address that they’re frustrated, they shut down and become stubborn, quiet, and withdrawn.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“They keep on saying, ‘I’m going to do it’ and ‘I’m sorry,’ and yet you continue to feel resentful about them. So, when your feelings don’t match up and you’re left confused about how you should deal with this person, that’s one indication that it’s not necessarily you. You’re getting mixed messages from this person.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-backhanded-compliments">6. Backhanded compliments</h3>



<p>Backhanded compliments are comments or expressions that seem positive at first, but it&#8217;s actually an insult. These are also known as &#8220;non-compliments&#8221; or &#8220;disguised insults&#8221; as backhanded compliments are usually indirect and subtle.</p>



<p>Some examples of backhanded compliments are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When you get a new haircut and your roommate says, &#8220;your haircut makes your nose look smaller.&#8221;</li>



<li>You&#8217;re going out for the night and they say, &#8220;that&#8217;s a beautiful dress on you. I didn&#8217;t even realize it was you at first glance.&#8221;</li>



<li>When your roommate comments on how your room or personal space looks: &#8220;I wish I was as relaxed as you in this mess.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-being-sarcastic">7. Being sarcastic</h3>



<p>Having a sarcastic roommate can be tiresome if it gets too much. It&#8217;s similar to backhanded compliments in a way that both are verbal and indirect, but sarcastic comments are a bit more upfront than backhanded compliments.</p>



<p>Plus, sarcasm is usually with irony or mockery that can be hurtful, especially with roommates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-slamming-doors-intentionally">8. Slamming doors intentionally</h3>



<p>Another sign of having a passive-aggressive roommate is when they slam the doors to your apartment intentionally. For example, you had an argument, you told them off, or confronted them on something they did, then they suddenly leave the apartment then slam the door on their way out. It&#8217;s disrespectful and can disturb others living the apartment or even on the same floor, as the noise of the door slamming travels through the hallway.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-deal-with-a-passive-aggressive-roommate-tips-amp-tricks">How to Deal with a Passive-Aggressive Roommate: Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<p>It’s normal to feel angry when <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-to-set-in-apartments-for-rent-with-roommates/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dealing</a> with the behaviors of a passive-aggressive roommate. But the thing to keep in mind with passive-aggressive roommates is, you can&#8217;t change them.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“[You] can get them to stop eating their food a lot easier than they can get them to become more open with their anger and more responsible with their feelings,” Dorfman says. “You deal with the specific situation, not with the personality.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>As per Dorfman, some solutions to dealing with a passive-aggressive roommate are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tell your roommate you&#8217;re frustrated, ask them what&#8217;s going on, and discuss your concerns with them. But you should also be prepared for them to get defensive and shut down.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Talk to someone you trust who can see the situation objectively to get their perspective.</li>



<li>Try going to therapy or counseling to work things out if both are willing.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, the solutions depend on how volatile the behaviors of your roommate are.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>“Passive-aggressive style is on a continuum; it’s not all or nothing. Certain people are more passive-aggressive than others, so I wouldn’t count anyone out who has a particular difficulty with someone,” Dorfman says. “You have to make the effort to try to resolve the issues and call somebody on what’s going on.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-solution-to-dealing-with-passive-aggressive-roommates">The Solution to Dealing with Passive-Aggressive Roommates</h2>



<p>Finding new roommates may be the solution to dealing with a passive-aggressive roommate. By seeking out individuals who are more communicative and considerate, you can create a more positive and harmonious living environment. Don&#8217;t let one negative experience discourage you from finding roommates who will bring joy and positivity to your home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Having a roommate can be awesome! From helping you to save money to becoming a good friend and making your home a more enjoyable place to be, you hit the jackpot when you find a good roomie. But when things go wrong, it can feel like hell. Unfortunately, you can’t just evict a roommate in California. In some cases, it’s not possible to do so at all.</p>



<p>It all comes down to your unique situation and what your roommate may have done. If you do have a good reason to evict a roommate, you have to know how it works. You don&#8217;t want to find yourself on the wrong side of the law, even though you&#8217;re in the right.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-kind-of-roommate-can-you-evict">What Kind of Roommate Can You Evict?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/9PkfA9vqXSk2KvqiHj" title="bad roommate"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>If your roommate is on the lease agreement with you, then they only answer to your landlord. Even if your roommate is not on the lease but pays rent directly to your landlord, you still cannot evict them. Even if they&#8217;re guilty of roommate harassment, the best you can do is report them to the landlord. However, your landlord can&#8217;t evict anyone without a just cause, such as causing damage or refusing to pay rent.</p>



<p>If your roommate is a subtenant (meaning you sublet your apartment out at a cost), then you can evict them. Of course, you still have to follow due process as your landlord would.</p>



<p>If you have a guest that has stayed in your apartment for more than 30 days, then they have become a &#8216;<a href="https://www.talkovlaw.com/tenancy-at-will-termination/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenant at will</a>’ and you can&#8217;t just throw them out, either.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-do-you-evict-a-roommate-in-california">How Do You Evict a Roommate in California?</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3o6Mb6MYhk1fShAzx6" title="evict"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Any eviction process must begin with a written notice according to the <a href="https://www.sb-court.org/self-help/landlord-tenant/landlord-tenant-action" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenancy law in California</a>. The notice must specify how many days the tenant has until you will terminate the tenancy. If there’s a reason for the eviction, you must also specify this in the notice.</p>



<p>If the culprit had signed a written sublease agreement with you, and there is a just cause, three days quit notice will suffice. If the person has stayed with you for up to a year, even without a lease agreement, you must provide a rent notice of at least 60 days. If it is less than one year, you’ll need to give at least 30 days’ notice.</p>



<p>Either you or your agent must serve this notice of eviction, in line with the law. If you choose to evict a roommate without sticking to the roommate&#8217;s law in California, your case may get thrown out of court.</p>

<p></p>



<p>You need a good, approved reason to evict your roommate in California, but there are some ways you can get rid of a bad roomie according to the roommate law in California. If, for example, you are pursuing eviction and plan to give 30 or 60 days’ notice, you don&#8217;t need to provide a good reason. However, if you&#8217;re aiming to evict someone within a shorter time frame, then you need to be able to justify your position.</p>



<p>If you’re subleasing to a roommate, you can evict them in California much more quickly &#8211; especially if there&#8217;s a history of bad behavior. Specifically, you can evict with only three days notice and have the backing of the law to pursue eviction if your roommate is guilty of any of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Refusal to pay rent</li><li>Violating the lease agreement in any way</li><li>History of roommate harassment</li><li>Damaging the property and utilities</li><li>Disturbing other tenants</li><li>Using the unit for an illegal activity</li></ul>



<p>Make sure you have a reason before expelling anyone from your apartment. The law mandates that eviction shouldn’t be a way to retaliate or discriminate against an individual.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-if-my-roommate-refuses-to-leave">What If My Roommate Refuses to Leave?</h2>

								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p></p>



<p>So you&#8217;re tired of your roommate and even after serving them notice, they won&#8217;t budge. What can you do? You certainly can&#8217;t just change the locks on the door. You&#8217;ll end up with a fine.</p>



<p>If you’re evicting your roommate for a just cause and they rectify their behavior, they can stay. For example, if your roommate decides to pay all owed rent, you’ll have to accept the rent and move on. However, if they’re still being difficult, you can move forward with the eviction.</p>



<p>In that case, if the notice period expires and the roommate doesn’t budge, you must file paperwork in court to start an <a href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/unlawful-detainer-lawyers.html#:~:text=In%20real%20estate%20law%2C%20an,required%20to%20vacate%20the%20premises.)" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlawful detainer suit</a> against your roommate.</p>



<p>Once in motion, your roommate may choose to respond to the court in an attempt to fight the eviction. Nonetheless, the court will set a trial date within 20 days from when you get the notification. Usually, it&#8217;s a judge-only trial. If you win the case, the sheriff will give your roommate a notice of five days to move out. If they need to stay longer, they can file a stay of execution with the court to request more time.</p>

<p>No one wants to have to resort to the option of evicting someone. However, whether it&#8217;s a friend or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/good-bad-ugly-living-sibling/">relative</a> that is not leaving of their own accord, you might need to resort to legal eviction. So, how do you go about kicking out someone who hasn&#8217;t signed your apartment lease? We know this is an uncomfortable situation. So, we&#8217;ve prepared a handy guide for you that will help you gauge your living situation and how to carry out the necessary eviction. <strong>Below, you&#8217;ll learn how and when to evict a roommate not on lease, determine what kind of &#8220;roommate&#8221; they are legally, and actionable steps you can take towards eviction.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="roommate-guest-tenant-at-will-or-subtenant">Roommate, Guest, Tenant-At Will, or Subtenant?</h2>



<p><strong>First of all, you have to determine whether the person(s) you want to evict are roommates, guests, tenants-at-will, or subtenants.</strong> Depending on the distinction, there will be separate laws with regard to evicting roommates. These also vary depending on state laws.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="who-is-a-roommate">Who is a Roommate?</h3>



<p>A roommate is someone you share living expenses with, such as rent and utilities. They are named on your rental agreement/lease as co-tenants.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="who-is-a-guest">Who is a Guest?</h3>



<p>A guest is a person who has been invited into another&#8217;s home. They aren&#8217;t expected to split rent or utilities.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="who-is-a-tenant-at-will">Who is a Tenant-At-Will?</h3>



<p>A tenant-at-will is someone who lives with you in your house, but doesn’t pay rent and doesn’t have a set date on which they must move out or pay rent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="who-is-a-subtenant">Who is a Subtenant?</h3>



<p>A subtenant is someone who rents living space from a tenant who’s already renting the unit from someone else. The tenant and their subtenant will have a written agreement specifying what part(s) of the rental unit they can access and for how long they’ll be renting from the tenant.</p>

<p>The decision to evict a roommate is hard. If you&#8217;ve made up your mind, the first action to take is to talk to your landlord. Whether it&#8217;s a relative, friend or family member whose name is not on the lease, communicate with your landlord. Inform them about why roommate eviction is the best way forward. If your unwanted guest&#8217;s signatures are not on the agreement, then evicting a roommate not on lease won&#8217;t be a problem. Your landlord can do this for you.</p>



<p><strong>Warning: I</strong>f your lease prohibits unauthorized roommates or guests, you run the risk of getting yourself evicted too!</p>

<p>You must provide them with a formal notice informing them they need to move out of the property. According to your state&#8217;s law, you may have to hand the notice to them in person, send it by certified mail, or post it on the door of the apartment.</p>



<p><strong>What is included in the formal notice to evict a roommate?</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The roommate’s full name, address, and unit number.</li>



<li>The specific ways the roommate is causing you distress as mentioned in the section above.</li>



<li>How long the tenant has to move out of the rental unit which will be determined by your state&#8217;s roommate law.</li>



<li>A statement that you will be filing a formal eviction if the behavior isn&#8217;t remedied or if the tenant doesn&#8217;t voluntarily move out</li>



<li>Lastly, the date of the notice and your signature.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Any communication with your roommate regarding the eviction should be done in writing. And, everyone should sign and date it. Breaking the law by changing locks, removing property, or threatening illegal action is never a good idea.</p>

<p>Depending on the state you live in, there are different methods to evict a roommate not on lease from your property.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Deliver an Eviction Notice:</strong> <a href="https://ipropertymanagement.com/templates/tennessee-room-rental-agreement" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tennessee</a> requires the tenant to file some type of court case under the state&#8217;s roommate laws in order to evict a roommate not on lease.</li>



<li><strong>Contact Law Enforcement:</strong> Some states like <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/33/01378.htm" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arizona</a> allow you to go directly to law enforcement to have the person removed from your home without opening a court case. If you live in a state where law enforcement is used to remove a person from your property, then you don’t have to do anything else. From here on, they will be in in charge of the eviction process.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>However, if you don&#8217;t live in a law-enforcement evictions state, you must give the person a written eviction notice before filing your court case.</strong> Additionally, you&#8217;ll also need to make sure that you&#8217;ve properly delivered it to the person you want to remove, or your court case could be dismissed.</p>

<p>In some states, a court hearing is required to remove a person from a rental agreement. In these cases, the person who filed the case must attend the hearing or the case will be dismissed. If your landlord has filed the case on your behalf, it&#8217;s still a good idea to attend the hearing. This is in case the court needs more evidence or calls you as a witness. <strong>In conclusion, there are a few takeaways from the process &#8211; store all evidence in writing, communicate openly, and take legal recourse if necessary to protect yourself. </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Having a senior roommate can be beneficial in a variety of ways. If you hadn&#8217;t thought about it before, it’s time to reconsider. In the sitcom Two And a Half Men, we see Alan and his son Jake move in with Alan&#8217;s older brother, Charlie. Jake didn&#8217;t really get a choice in the matter (Charlie is his uncle), but he does wind up living with a senior roommate. And it doesn&#8217;t turn out so bad!</p>

<p>Life on social security or retirement payments can make it difficult for many seniors to maintain the same standard of living they enjoyed during their working years. In an increasingly costly world, living on a fixed income presents problems. Especially since the expense of maintaining living spaces and the cost of an assisted living facility have both increased.</p>



<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.seniorly.com/resource-center/senior-living-guides/understanding-the-cost-of-assisted-living" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Understanding the Cost of Assisted Living</a></p>



<p>According to data from SpareRoom, the number of individuals over 50 living with roommates is rising nearly twice as quickly as any other age group. One in every five of them is sharing a room for the first time. And it&#8217;s typically following life events such as divorce or empty nesting. Many of them are motivated by financial considerations, particularly by elderly individuals who want to remain in their homes as they age, much like Charlies’ situation. And as they say, maybe living with roommates is becoming a little less <em>Friends</em> and a little more <em>Grace and Frankie</em>.</p>



<p>If you think these are the qualities you are looking for in a person sharing a space, having senior roommates is definitely your cup of tea.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. A unique first hand experience</h2>



<p>While senior housemates are increasingly using social media, they are still lagging behind younger generations. This implies that elders have a wealth of information that you can only learn by living with them or through connecting with them in person. And, especially if you&#8217;re new to the city, who knows what amazing things you&#8217;ll learn! If only there was a book that contained the wisdom passed on by Charlie to Jake right?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Financial and social benefits</h2>



<p>With one of the highest generational divorce rates and more children moving out, many baby boomers are finding themselves living alone. Living alone is a predictor of loneliness and a risk factor for health concerns. These concerns include depression, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline, according to some studies on social isolation among older individuals.</p>



<p>Sharing a place with someone else can help them feel less lonely. And sometimes also helps you feel like you have family around. Though Charlie had no issues with his ‘social life’, he did consider Jake and Alan a bond he needed.</p>

<p>Older Americans who live alone are likewise more financially strained than those who live with others. According to Pew Research, just 33% of older individuals feel financially secure living alone. Further, SpareRoom statistics show that 63% of tenants over 50 are rent-burdened.</p>



<p>Sharing expenses while living independently can help senior citizens extend a fixed income before they decide to move to a more expensive assisted living residence. As long as the seniors can maintain their independence, the savings over continuing care retirement communities can be substantial.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Social security – especially for senior women</h2>



<p>Older women typically feel less pressed to stay in marriages for cultural or religious reasons now that divorce is less stigmatized. In fact, studies show that women are the ones who initiate the majority of divorces. Living with someone who loves her independence may be freeing and powerful for any young person. However, it&#8217;s also reassuring to know that simply being yourself can add to a senior roommate&#8217;s or older person&#8217;s happiness!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to find senior roommates</h2>



<p>Roomi is a roommate finder app that works on both Android and iOS devices. All of the postings and users on Roomi are screened to ensure that there are no red flags or fraudsters posing as potential roommates. It&#8217;s simple to use for both millennials and elders, and you can sign up for an account for free. Simply submit an ad or search for roommates once you&#8217;re up and running. Then, message those you think could be compatible. The software even goes so far as to transfer your roommate&#8217;s share of the rent on the day they move in.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If there&#8217;s one thing that can turn your daily life into a living hell, it&#8217;s cohabitation with an OCD roommate. Now, Paris Geller wasn&#8217;t exactly diagnosed with OCD or obsessive-compulsive disorder. But she was the perfect example of a crazy roommate, assuming prefect-like authority to enforce rules. When your roommate is a control freak, you may feel your boundaries encroached upon. You might also feel any move you make might be taken against you. Rory Gilmore and Paris were rivals turned frenemies in high school, which made things even more complicated when they went to college. Living with a roommate like her? Here&#8217;s how you can deal with an OCD roommate, based on Rory and Paris&#8217;s story.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Embrace the unexpected.</h2>

<p>When you&#8217;re living with an OCD roommate, expect a lot of surprises each day. Like, for starters, them popping up and announcing themselves as your roommate. When Paris doesn&#8217;t get into Harvard, she shows up unexpectedly at Rory&#8217;s college dorm at Yale. She brings her life coach, who advises her to &#8220;complete her life journey&#8221; by enrolling in the same school. Paris&#8217;s life coach also tells her to take up crafts as keeping her hands busy minimizes her emotional outbursts. Rory and Paris living together definitely made their college lives super interesting.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can cope with the little annoyances, now. The old Paris would&#8217;ve been bothered by your penchant hover. It would&#8217;ve made her wanna wring your neck &#8217;til your eyeballs popped out. But now, I accept it because I can&#8217;t control everything.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Let her have her way.</h2>

<p>The last thing you want to do when living with an OCD roommate is get in her way. When your roommate is a control freak, it&#8217;s best to just let her do what she wants to do.</p>



<p>Paris is so annoyed with their roommate Janet—who has a partial athletics scholarship—that she occasionally calls for &#8220;roommate meetings.&#8221; The huddles are meant for the roomies to &#8220;air their grievances&#8221; and to &#8220;resolve them.&#8221; Rory and Paris, along with their roommates Tanna and Janet, meet together in the living room for these pow-wows. But settling differences, it turns out, is not on the agenda!</p>



<p>Paris says to Janet: &#8220;Setting your alarm for 5:30 in the morning when no one else here shares the desire to put on nylon shorts and run in circles for an hour like a greyhound is selfish.&#8221;</p>



<p>Janet for sure thinks Paris is a crazy roommate. Paris even picks on Janet&#8217;s boyfriend, Andre, for his bulky physique.</p>



<p>When someone writes &#8220;DIE JERK&#8221; on their door, Paris calls for yet another roommate meeting. She concludes that they could identify the perpetrator by listing down their enemies&#8217; names. Paris narrows down her list from 26 to five.</p>



<p>One afternoon, Rory&#8217;s grandfather, Richard, shows up at Yale and has lunch with them. He tells Rory and Paris about the time he and his friends tied up their roommate each day for a month and would toss him out the window.</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;I&#8217;m writing that down.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Deal with her quirky interests.</h2>

<p>Living with a roommate means being around to witness each other&#8217;s highs and lows. Paris, being the OCD roommate that she is, had peculiar ways of channeling her emotions.</p>



<p>When Paris loses her lover—the elderly Yale professor Asher Fleming—to a heart attack, she&#8217;s wrought with grief. In his memory, she brings into their dorm a massive 18th-century printing press that Asher left her. Rory and Paris end up in a mini-argument because of the monstrosity.</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;It&#8217;s on my book bag! I&#8217;m late for class and you put a printing press on my bookbag.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;Well, sorry, it&#8217;s from my dead boyfriend, okay? I apologize if my grief is inconveniencing you. Maybe I&#8217;ll just put myself on an iceberg and float myself out to sea so that no one will have to deal with my suffering.&#8221;</p>



<p>Later on in the series, Paris eventually moves on and falls in love with Doyle, the editor of the <em>Yale Daily News</em>. For some reason, they endure a long-lasting relationship because Doyle can tolerate Paris&#8217;s hostility, type A personality, and explosive episodes. Some of their strange bonding activities include Krav Maga and partner yoga. Rory&#8217;s mom, Lorelai, must think Paris is quite the crazy roommate with an equally quirky boyfriend.</p>



<p>Paris to Rory, about Doyle: &#8220;You know, he calls me his girlfriend, now, with no visible shaking.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Don&#8217;t take her competitiveness too seriously.</h2>

<p>Time and time again, Rory finds herself facing Paris&#8217;s wrath whenever she naturally outshines her. Let&#8217;s not forget that Rory and Paris were each other&#8217;s biggest competition in high school. So whenever Paris is better than Rory at something, Rory just shrugs it off. But boy, Paris sure knows how to rub Rory&#8217;s weaknesses in her face. Thankfully, Rory exhibits amazing patience while living with a roommate like Paris.</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;Paris, please don&#8217;t compare our reading speeds again. You&#8217;re fast, I&#8217;m slow, go enjoy your trophy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;I need the exact time of today&#8217;s sunset.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;I&#8217;m in the middle of an article.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;If you read faster, you wouldn&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>



<p>Towards the end of their senior year, Paris knows she can count on Rory for their final push before graduating. She literally has like five whiteboards filled with charts and to-dos. She has one for academics, career ops, and job fairs. Paris even schedules weekly report-back sessions, revealing herself as such an OCD roommate. This is typical behavior when your roommate is a control freak.</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;This is the game plan for what I call &#8216;Operation Finish Line.&#8217; We only have five months left before we leave the warm and comforting bosom of this university and face the bitterly cold shoulder of the real world.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;We?&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;You&#8217;re the green marker. Green was a random choice, not a subtle comment about how inexperienced you are with real-life matters. Then again, maybe it was.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Give her your full support and attention, no matter what she may be going through.</h2>

<p>Rory knows more than anyone that Paris is a real softie inside. Growing up with a &#8220;half-Viking&#8221; mom, no wonder Paris became such an OCD roommate. She&#8217;s abrasive but loses her tough exterior when she&#8217;s treated with kindness. Rory and Paris develop such a bond on the show that fans even linked the two of them romantically.</p>



<p>During the show, Paris and Doyle break up twice. The first time it happens, Paris sulks and blares music from a 1960s video where people dance. Despite looking obviously bothered by the noise, Rory just leaves Paris to do what she wants.</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;Every one of these people is dead. It makes me sad.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;That movie&#8217;s from the 60s. They&#8217;re not all dead.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;Well, they&#8217;re old. Osteoporosis these days, if they shake it, they break it. That makes me sad.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris is accepted to all the law and medical schools she applies for. Because she&#8217;s anxious about deciding whether to take up law or medicine, she snaps.</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;Your noticeable drop of enthusiasm? Is that an expression of the fact that you&#8217;re less impressed by my admission into the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine than my other acceptances?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rory and Paris might not have a conventional friendship, but it&#8217;s one that pushes them both to excel in whatever they do. Sure, an OCD roommate might not be ideal for everyone, but in their case, it works because of their strong bond.</p>

<p>If you dream about having a roommate relationship like Ted and Marshall from How I met Your Mother, you must take our living advice seriously! Both of them made living with roommates look like a cakewalk, and honestly, it can be only if you set your priorities and boundaries in place! Your roommate left the empty milk carton in the fridge; what would you do pick from the options below:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>I would call them and scream about it, this is unacceptable.</li><li>Or I would get a new one, add the expenses to the app which helps us settle the bill, and then remind them that they forgot to throw away the old carton.</li><li>I would start labeling grocery/food, I take my cereal very seriously!</li></ol>



<p>If you found peace with option 1, we would politely ask you not to dream about having a tight bond like Ted and Marshall.</p>



<p>If option 2 would be your way to handle the situation, we are very proud of you! Let&#8217;s find Ted to your Marshall!</p>



<p>Option 3 is not all that bad, but could be used eventually if your roommate keeps on repeating the same mistake!</p>



<p><strong>Find your perfect +1 for exploring the city you are planning to move to. With us, it&#8217;s always a match! </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;ve watched the show &#8216;Friends&#8217;, you should be no stranger to Joey and Chandler and their roommate relationship. In fact, many of us grew up watching Friends and dreaming of living with roommates in NYC and having adventures. Roommate-based TV shows give us a romanticized view of life with roommates. However, there is also a lot to learn from them about apartment rules and living with a roommate. Read on as we look at Joey and Chandler and the lessons on apartment living from this iconic roommate duo.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find the right roommate</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/LoJwuxdKYJ1ja"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/LoJwuxdKYJ1ja/giphy.gif?resize=500%2C245&#038;ssl=1" alt="Animated GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="500" height="245" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>In Friends, we see Chandler search for a new roommate when Joey moves into a new, swanky apartment. While at the supermarket, he meets Eddie, who later moves in with Chandler as his new roommate. However, Eddie and Chandler have nothing in common and struggle to get along as roommates. Eddie hates Baywatch, foosball, and sports, steals mannequins from Macy&#8217;s, and dehydrates fruit for fun. Furthermore, when Eddie&#8217;s ex-girlfriend Tilly comes by to drop off his old, empty goldfish tank, he becomes suspicious of Chandler. He believes that Chandler slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.</p>



<p>After several mishaps and confrontations, Chandler finally manages to rid himself of Eddie. Hence, the moral here is to make sure you find someone who is the right fit if you are planning on living with a roommate! They are a huge part of apartment life and can make or break the experience.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set and follow apartment rules</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/good-job-2HMUYBYrhg4Gk"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media3.giphy.com/media/2HMUYBYrhg4Gk/giphy.gif?resize=281%2C200&#038;ssl=1" alt=" - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="281" height="200" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Not everyone will appreciate you building a cardboard box fort in the living room! And there is a lot to learn not to do from Joey as well. Furthermore, no one likes a messy or noisy roommate who doesn&#8217;t do their fair share of the household chores. Be sure that you have a clearly laid out and agreed-upon set of apartment rules and responsibilities. Taking out the trash, washing the dishes, and paying bills are all shared responsibilities.</p>



<p>Additionally, you&#8217;ll avoid conflict if you have your apartment rules clearly laid out while living with a roommate. Also, don&#8217;t forget the most important rule; &#8220;Joey doesn’t share food!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Accept your roommates for who they are</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/friends-milk-joey-tribbiani-BLZVQ73Gl53Ak"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/BLZVQ73Gl53Ak/giphy.gif?resize=450%2C327&#038;ssl=1" alt="Joey Tribbiani Friends GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="450" height="327" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>When living with a roommate, there are going to be peculiar habits that you may notice and even find annoying. For example, in Friends, Joey and Chandler have their differences and still manage to go past them and live together. There is no perfect roommate, but it&#8217;s about finding the thing you both love and accepting each other.</p>



<p>Maybe you think a big white dog statue is an eyesore and a waste of space. However, it&#8217;s all about accepting their different tastes and opinions while living with a roommate. Even if your roommate is a bit immature or messy like Joey, a bit obsessive like Monica. Besides, Chandler has seen it all and still managed to get along and live with both of them!</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/traits-to-observe-when-looking-for-a-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Looking for a roommate? Here are some qualities to look for!</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Occasional conflicts are a part of living with roommates</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/Friends-friends-season-5-tv-dAuumiq85i5evf5UVY"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media4.giphy.com/media/dAuumiq85i5evf5UVY/giphy.gif?resize=480%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Not Listening Season 5 GIF by Friends - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="480" height="400" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Living with a roommate means that you are bound to have disagreements from time to time. For instance, maybe your roommate has done something that annoys you, or you can&#8217;t seem to agree on something. Remember that even iconic roommate duos like Joey and Chandler have conflicts sometimes. Moreover, it&#8217;s about overcoming these disagreements and making peace that teaches us great lessons about living with a roommate. Even if your roommate might think it&#8217;s funny to wear everything you own, with no underwear on.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, communication and forgiveness are key to getting over issues you have while living with roommates. Furthermore, you should never hold a grudge and move on, much like when Chandler kissed Joey’s girlfriend and offered to sit in a wooden box until Joey forgave him.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Friends in need are friends indeed!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/tvland-friends-recliner-friendsontvland-r728rYRDDKzp6"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media0.giphy.com/media/r728rYRDDKzp6/giphy.gif?resize=400%2C225&#038;ssl=1" alt="Reclining Best Friends GIF by TV Land Classic - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="400" height="225" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>A roommate is much more than just someone you bump into from time to time. In fact, they are one of the closest friends you&#8217;ll have away from home and living in NYC like in Friends. Joey and Chandler showed us that you can go from strangers to the best of friends. Moreover, being one of the most iconic duos from roommate-based TV shows means there is a lot to learn from them. A roommate is always there for you and has your back. Whether you&#8217;re upset, heartbroken, in trouble, or want to kick back and watch some Baywatch!</p>



<p>Besides, it&#8217;s always great to have someone to help around, like when you need to pivot a giant bed to get it up the stairs. How Joey and Chandler knew each other and what troubled the other person so well are roommate goals! Joey and Chandler were also willing to help their other friends and give their all. Just like that one time Monica got stung by a jellyfish at the beach.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Remember to have fun!</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dancing-friends-cV5s29FfjZOkU"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media2.giphy.com/media/cV5s29FfjZOkU/giphy.gif?resize=318%2C212&#038;ssl=1" alt="Friends Dancing GIF - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="318" height="212" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Living in NYC and trying to manage your work can be stressful and difficult. Therefore, it is important to have a roommate who can remind you to take a break and have fun. Joey and Chandler on Friends are always ready to have some fun or take a break from the stress of life. Even though Joey and Chandler weren&#8217;t always great at giving advice, they were there for each other.</p>



<p>Similarly, just being there and willing to have some fun is sometimes all you need from a roommate when you&#8217;re feeling down. Joey and Chandler are always able to put a smile on people’s faces. Whether it is with their jokes, pranks, or occasionally by accident.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a narcissist?</h2>



<p>First off, you must understand <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">narcissistic personality disorder</a>. (NPD) It is a legitimate mental health condition that requires diagnosis by a mental health professional. The term narcissist is widely used interchangeably with NPD and this is a misunderstanding. While there are certain hallmark characteristics of NPD, having them does not necessarily mean you have the condition. A person can exhibit some characteristics of NPD and not actually suffer from it. However, if their narcissism is a strong pattern of behavior, they may be diagnosed with NPD. The first analysis you need to make is if your roommate is suffering from NPD or if they show have narcissistic tendencies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do I identify a narcissist?</h2>



<p>While having these characteristics does not essentially make one a narcissist, these are a few characteristics of one. Being a narcissist or having these tendencies is not the same as having NPD. Hence, it necessary for a medical professional to diagnose NPD. That said, here are some indication that you could be dealing with a narcissist roommate.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>They are preoccupied with fantasies about their own beauty, brilliance, and power.</li>



<li>They have a lack of empathy for others.</li>



<li>Unable to handle criticism and lash out if they feel slighted criticized.</li>



<li>Need constant praise.</li>



<li>They are willing to take advantage of others to get what they want.</li>



<li>They expect to be treated as superior or leader.</li>



<li>Have no remorse for hurting others.</li>



<li>Blame others for their own bad behavior or mistakes.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dealing with your narcissist roomate</h2>



<p>If you feel that your roommate exhibits a lot of these characteristics, then you could be living with a narcissist roommate. While you can&#8217;t be sure if it is NPD, there are some actions you can take. Narcissists can be very demanding and draining to live with. Hence, it is important that you take steps to deal with their behavior. Here is how you can try to make living with a narcissist roommate a little easier.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Accept who they are</h3>



<p>When they want to, those with narcissistic personalities are great at charming people. You might find yourself drawn to your narcissist roommate and their show of grandiose. These are also particularly popular in work settings or among their colleagues. When it comes to narcissists, they seem to draw all the attention towards themselves. Do not let all of this carry you away or make you react to them. Understand that these tendencies are just the way they are and, are common for people like them. Do not take their actions or words personally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do not try to change them</h3>



<p>The first step in dealing with your narcissist roommate is simply accepting that you cannot change them. Do not expect them to change, or you will just end up disappointed and frustrated. No matter how rationally you try to explain things, they are unlikely to hear you. Arguing with a narcissist may escalate the situation and trigger their inability to handle criticism. You need to understand that there is nothing that you can do to change a narcissist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Do not feed their behavior</h3>



<p>Now that you have understood the tendencies of a narcissist, do not fall prey to them. They can make you feel pressured to push aside your own needs to keep them satisfied. They can be extremely demanding of your attention, praise, and obedience. However, it is essential you show them that they cannot bully you into submission. If you think there will be a break in their attention-seeking behavior, it doesn&#8217;t come. Do not humor a narcissist&#8217;s false reality and delusions. No matter how much you try to adjust your life to suit their needs, it is never enough.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Know yourself!</h3>



<p>Your narcissist roommate does not live in reality. Hence, their views of themselves and other people are wildly delusional. Remember this when a narcissist tries to manipulate, gaslight, or bully you. Don’t let their shame and blame strategy and manipulation undermine your self-esteem. The best defense against the insults and projections of the narcissist is your self-esteem. When you know yourself well, you are able to reject any unfair criticisms leveled against you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Have &#8216;the talk&#8217;</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve gone over the situation and made your assessment, it is time for you to sit them down. Let them know honestly but in a sensitive and friendly way. Put your foot down and don&#8217;t budge if they are being unreasonable. Avoid confronting them in a public space or in front of a large group of people as this can trigger them. They may react aggressively and fight back to save face. Hence, be ready to back off if you feel the situation could escalate. All the best!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let them go</h3>



<p>Maybe you have tried your best to accept who they are and deal with them. However, they still make living absolutely unbearable. This doesn&#8217;t need to be the case. It may be time to cut off your narcissist roommate. There are many fish (potential roommates) in the sea (city.) If they don&#8217;t value you, it could be time to search for a new roommate. Lucky for you, you&#8217;re already in the right place!</p>



<p>Roomi can help you find roommates and find one who is the right living partner for you. Better luck this time. Choose well!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Assessing the situation</h2>



<p>Before we get around to creating a plan of action, we need to assess the situation. Get to know the problem better and find out what the cause is. Sometimes there is so much more to a situation and person than you think. Here are some questions to ask yourself before you start looking for solutions.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your roommate doing alright?</h3>



<p>This past year or so has been extremely stressful and everyone&#8217;s mental health has taken a toll. It can be understandable if your roommate has been extremely cranky. Is your roommate doing okay? They may under immense pressure from their job or college or be overloaded with assignments. Your roommate maybe just going through a rough patch and keeping it all to themselves.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is your roommate mentally unwell?</h3>



<p>Coming off the previous point, your roommate may be suffering from mental issues. You may not understand or know what is going in their personal lives. Thus, you only see them being difficult with you. While you are probably not a mental health expert, there may be signs. Are they having difficulties with people, their work, or their family? Do they seem to be troubled all the time and can&#8217;t seem to have fun once in a while?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is it your fault?</h3>

<p>No, we aren&#8217;t gaslighting you or putting the blame on you, friend. We&#8217;d never. Your controlling roommate should never behave with you like that anyway. However, a little self-reflection may be in order. Is there something that you have done to see this side of them? Is there a time that you may have been rude or unkind to justify this kind of treatment? Or are you skipping your chores or being exceptionally messy?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are they just jealous?</h3>



<p>Now, we understand that you&#8217;re quite a cool kid and your friends love you. While you may have previously expected that your roommate will too, it is possible they&#8217;re jealous. After all, not everyone can handle all the awesomeness hon.</p>



<p>There could be some reason why your controlling roommate is jealous of you. This may just be their way of expressing it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding a solution</h2>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve found the root of the problem, it&#8217;s time to resolve this, once and for all. You want to be careful and sensitive while dealing with your roommate. Make sure you don&#8217;t send them into a flying rage. However, if you read on, we&#8217;re pretty sure you won&#8217;t.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You have to deal with it</h3>



<p>Now, not all of us are great at confrontation. The introverts and socially awkward kids among us understand the pressure of something like this. However, you can&#8217;t always keep walking on eggshells around your own apartment. Think of all that you have been put with, and convince yourself that you need to have this conversation. The sooner you deal with this the better. Do not put it off for later and give a chance for more issues to come up.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make changes yourself</h3>



<p>If there is any way that you may have triggered your controlling roommate, try to see if you can do something. Clean up your space, be considerate, do your chores and give them their space. If there is something that you are doing wrong, try to make amends and see if your controlling roommate reacts to this positively.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lend an ear to them</h3>



<p>It could be that issues at work, college, or their personal life are the cause of their behavior. Make yourself more approachable and let them know you are there to lend an ear to them. If not, approach them and ask them how they are doing. Perhaps even share a few problems that you are having and take initiative. If they warm up to you and share their problems, then you may be on the path to a resolution.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Be sensitive and mindful</h3>



<p>When you sit down to have a conversation with your controlling roommate, be mindful of how you approach them. The last thing you want to do is come off as aggressive or antagonize your controlling roommate. Make sure you approach them in a friendly way. If you have common friends, you may want to discuss this with them and even have them there. Be sensitive and willing to hear if they have any issues.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Exercise caution</h3>



<p>The last thing you want to do is trigger your controlling roommate. They could have a tendency to go off the hook. If you feel that things could head wildly South, then make sure you have a friend around. If things escalate, be ready to call building security, the management, or even the police. After all, you never know with people. The last thing you want is to get hurt or into a physical conflict.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Set rules</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s never too late to set rules. If you feel that setting rules and boundaries will help, sit your roommate down. You can make a set of rules and responsibilities to share. This may help with your situation and ease the tension. Be open to their suggestions as well, and try to make something that works for everyone. Remember your rights as a roommate too. You don&#8217;t need to cave into ridiculous suggestions from your controlling roommates.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Time for &#8216;the talk&#8217;</h3>



<p>No, not that one. Once you&#8217;ve gone over the situation and made your assessment, it is time for you to sit them down. Let them know honestly but in a sensitive and friendly way. Put your foot down and don&#8217;t budge if they are being unreasonable. However, be ready to back off if you feel the situation could escalate. This is the make or break part. All the best!</p>

<p>Maybe it just isn&#8217;t meant to be with your controlling roommate. Never mind. There are many fish (potential roommates) in the sea (city.) If they don&#8217;t value you, it could be time to search for a new roommate. Lucky for you, you&#8217;re already in the right place!</p>



<p>Roomi can help you find roommates and find one who is the right living partner for you. Better luck this time. Choose well!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>College life is one of the most transformative periods in a person’s life. I mean, how could it not be? You’re meeting new people, in a new city (maybe even <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/find-room-new-york-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a>?!) <em>and</em> you’re away from the comfort of your home! It’s kind of like an adulthood version of throwing yourself into the deep-end of the pool, and waiting to see if you sink or swim. Of course, it’s not all scary. You’ll make lifelong friends, have profound experiences and a whole lot of memories! And one of these profound experiences is the one that involves you living with a stranger. Y’know, your roommate? Your college roommate, conflict and all, will always hold a special meaning for you. And as fun as it is to have someone to share this whole new experience with, roommate problems are bound to arise.</p>



<p>So, today, we thought we’d talk about how to deal with conflicts that arise when you’re living with a college roommate for the very first time. Don’t worry, most problems are fixable if you both have the right tools. And that’s what we’re here to help with!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resolve any conflict with your college roommate with an agreement</h2>



<p>We know agreement sounds like such a formal word. I mean, that’s something you sign when you’re an <em>adult </em>adult and want to buy a New York City penthouse or something. But you’d be surprised by how much this helps. Of course, this document is not legally binding, but that doesn’t mean it’s not effective! Writing down your wants, needs and expectations from your roommate (and vice versa) can really set the right tone for your relationship. Trust us, you’ll feel like you know your new roommate a lot better after reading this agreement. And when conflict inevitably arises with your college roommate, you can just refer back to this agreement. <em>This </em>is how you deal with roommate problems in a healthy way!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communication is key when dealing with college roommate conflict</h2>



<p>We know, confronting a new college roommate might seem like a bad idea. After all, you want to be friends with your roommate, not accuse them of causing problems. But that’s just it, honest communication isn’t confrontation (Of course, if you decide to scream all your problems in their face, it won’t help). But if you (kindly and gently) let your roommate know when they do something you don’t like, they’ll try to accommodate you. They probably didn’t mean to piss you off on purpose.</p>



<p>Not to sound too much like a marriage counselor, but communication really is the key to most of your problems. A conflict with your college roommate will only escalate if you don’t communicate with them. What is a mild annoyance today, <em>will</em> become <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-stress-of-poor-communication-with-others-4154175" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">unbearable</a> when you’re both stressed out about final exams later in the semester. So, nip it in the bud and your dorm room will be a safe haven for both of you!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t point fingers at them</h2>



<p>We’re just going to keep the marriage counselor vibe going for just a second longer and give you this one advice: don’t put all the blame on them. When you start pointing fingers at them and blame them for all your problems, they will get <a href="https://www.tonyrobbins.com/love-relationships/words-matter-you-vs-i/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defensive</a>. This is actually advice that doesn’t just help you deal with your roommate problems, but problems with every other person. The moment people get defensive, they start (verbally) attacking back and that just doesn’t lead to anything good. And if your opponent is an 18 year old New York City college student, <em>oh boy</em>. So, maybe you should try telling them how their actions made you feel instead of telling them they’re irritating and a bad roommate. Sensitivity is key when dealing with a conflict with your college roommate!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If nothing else works, it’s time to call in the RA</h2>



<p>Your <a href="https://www.sofi.com/blog/pros-cons-of-being-an-ra/#:~:text=A resident assistant or resident,the residents of a dorm.&amp;text=Sharing information about the residence,campus activities%2C and available resources." target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Advisor</a> (or RA) might seem annoying when they’re enforcing “quiet hours” and telling you all the different ways in which you’re breaking University rules. But when it comes to mediating a conflict with your college roommate, they’re godsent. If your roommate problems persist and nothing seems to solve it, it may be time to call in your RA. Shoot them an email, or text (or snapchat, if y’all are cool) and let them know of the situation.</p>



<p>From there you can decide what action to take. Maybe the RA can meet with both of you one-on-one or perhaps a group session might be helpful. Whatever it is, an outside mediation can really put things into perspective.&nbsp; In the rare cases where nothing seems to work and you just can’t live with your roommate anymore, they might even help you switch rooms. Though this is a lot harder to do once the semester is already half-way done.</p>

<p>College life will throw you in a lot of situations that are less than ideal. That includes unpleasant roommates, but don’t let that ruin the whole experience for you. Honestly it actually might be good practice for if you ever move to New York City. Just remember, your roommate is only part of the college experience. And if you just can’t get along with them, there’s always a next semester!</p>
