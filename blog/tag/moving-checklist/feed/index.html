<p><strong>Everyone has a different idea of home, and in order to make your new place feel like yours, you&#8217;re going to want to start by deep cleaning all the surfaces.</strong> Whether you&#8217;re renting an apartment, townhouse, or even a fully furnished loft, it&#8217;s best to start from scratch &#8211; cleaning floors, wiping windows, and scrubbing the tiles and mirrors in the bathroom(s). This way, you&#8217;ll be able to visualize the clean space as your own, which means you can start thinking about where you&#8217;ll keep your plants or make a resting space for your pets.</p>

<p>Now that your space is clean, how about going over the floor plans? Luckily, there are plenty of great online tools to help you visualize the best way to arrange your furniture in your new apartment. If you know what the layout of your new home looks like, you can plan where to put your furniture before moving day arrives! This is especially useful for first-time renters to help them get the best out of the space they&#8217;re renting.</p>

<p>The coat rail is by the window, the pantry is freshly stocked, and the fresh linen smells lovely. Now, it&#8217;s time to unpack. We recommend doing this in small sections, room by room, to make this big job feel more manageable. <strong>For example, the first things you&#8217;ll want to unpack are your duvet and pillows, so you get a good night&#8217;s sleep in your new apartment!</strong></p>

<p>When you are moving to a new neighborhood, it is important for you to make a note of the local emergency phone numbers and addresses, for example, the nearest ER. Having these saved on your phone will save you from having to look them up when you really need them. Tick off one box on your moving in checklist by collating numbers and addresses for the police department, nearby hospitals, the fire department, and other emergency services now.</p>

<p>When it comes time to file your taxes, you&#8217;ll thank yourself for having kept all of your moving expenses and receipts in one place. In fact, it&#8217;s better to keep all your paperwork together, so you know where everything is when you need it. This is an important box to tick off on your moving in checklist, especially if you expect to write off any of those expenses on your income taxes.</p>

<p>Doing an inventory might not be high on your priority list, particularly if you&#8217;re exhausted from all the unpacking. However, making a list of everything in your new apartment helps to make sure that all your items have made it there safely and that you haven’t lost anything in transit. Furthermore, if you hired movers, compiling a home inventory is essential, because you may need to make a claim for lost or damaged property.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t want to be cold all through the winter or the sweat through your shirts in the summer, you will need to pay for utilities like water and heating. Utilities also include electricity and your internet connection. If you’re moving to a new city, state, or country, disconnecting and reconnecting utilities can be a bit of a hassle. However, the process is relatively simple if you keep track of which services need to be disconnected and where and when they can be reconnected.</p>

<p>Phew! After all the unpacking, organizing, and filing, you probably need a day or two to recover from the exhaustion. However, stay with us for one last thing &#8211; you won&#8217;t know how many keys are floating around for your new apartment until you get new locks or re-key the existing ones. If you&#8217;ve ever lived in a house where the previous owners gave out keys to everyone who asked, you&#8217;ll know how easy it can be for someone to waltz in and steal your valuables.</p>



<p>Changing the locks and keys to your new apartment is the final box to tick on your moving-in checklist for your own safety and the protection of your home.</p>
