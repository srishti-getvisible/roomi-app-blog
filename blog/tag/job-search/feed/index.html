Furthermore, Friedman <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/56624/the-good-girls-guide-to-getting-lost-by-rachel-friedman/#:~:text=About%20The%20Good%20Girl's%20Guide%20to%20Getting%20Lost&amp;text=There%20she%20forms%20an%20unlikely,previously%20unrealized%20passion%20for%20adventure." target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tells the story of her post-college experience</a> in her book for success.
