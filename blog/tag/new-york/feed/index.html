<p>A lease agreement is just a contract between a landlord and a tenant/renter that says how much should be paid monthly for rent and for how long. It&#8217;s a piece of paper that explains what you and your landlord have agreed upon.</p>



<p>Though it may seem intimidating due to the legal language used, but all you need is a basic understanding of what is it and you&#8217;re good to go!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How is a lease different from a rental agreement?</h3>



<p>While there isn&#8217;t a strict legal difference, in some instances, a rental agreement or a periodic tenancy may refer to a short-term rental contract. This term can be used in many contexts, but its most common usage is for month-to-month tenancy.</p>



<p>A lease agreement, on the other hand, allows the renter to lease a property for a set term, usually six months or over.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What does a lease contain?</h3>



<p>Any straightforward lease agreement will include:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The terms of your rental stay. </strong>This includes your time of stay, rent amount, and additional fees you may incur. This section will also contain the requirements you need in order to stay in the house, legally.</li>



<li><strong>Rules and Regulations. </strong>Some basic rules include matters involving home maintenance, guest subletting, and pet guidelines. Not following these rules may lead to eviction.</li>



<li><strong>Legal notices. </strong>This section will include the legal terms that exist between you, your house, and the landlord. Renters’ rights, advise on lead paint, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Parking paperwork. </strong>If your lease includes an assigned parking spot, you may be asked to fill out a form identifying your car.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Types of New York Lease Agreements</h3>



<p>There are several types of lease agreements and you should know which one you need to properly manage your living situation.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Standard Residential Lease Agreement:</strong> This is the regular lease agreement between a landlord and a tenant for a residential space.</li>



<li><strong>Month-to-Month Lease Agreement:</strong> From its name, this type of lease doesn&#8217;t have an end date. It renews every month until it&#8217;s terminated by either landlord or tenant with a month&#8217;s notice.</li>



<li><strong>Rent/Lease-to-Own Agreement:</strong> This rental contract means the tenant will eventually own the property over a period of time.</li>



<li><strong>Roommate Agreement</strong>: A legal document that states all agreed rules and responsibilities of the co-tenants.</li>



<li><strong>Sublease Agreement</strong>: This document is used by a tenant to rent their place to a subtenant during a specified period.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you know what a lease is, the next step is the lease signing. It&#8217;s not anything grand, but it&#8217;s the process with a formal contract where you officially agree to rent an apartment. This agreement seals the deal between the tenant and the landlord, or representative of the landlord. This process can take place both in person or online.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. What to expect during a lease signing:</h3>



<p>A lease signing will take place after you receive the approval of your application to rent an apartment in New York. Some renters are asked to appear physically and show a guarantee of funds during the lease signing. Others are asked to sign and pay remotely or electronically.</p>



<p>Just remember that before signing anything, you should know your <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities.page" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">rights and responsibilities</a> as a tenant.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. When to expect a lease signing:</h3>



<p>A lease signing happens after the renter receives their approval based on their credit report and their financial qualifications. The schedule for this is based on whether the landlord decides to approve your application.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. What to bring with you during a lease signing:</h3>



<p>Lease signing day will be nothing if not a day filled with paperwork. The New York City government requires all potential renters to carry the following documents to lease signing appointments:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Proof of employment: </strong>Some of the most widely accepted documents for proof of employment in New York City include:
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Past two months of pay stubs (or bank statements)</li>



<li>Offer of employment letter (for new hires)</li>



<li>Income tax returns (for self-employed renters)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Photo identification: </strong>As required with any major financial undertaking, your lease signing appointment will also require you to bring along a photo ID. This would also mean carrying identification documents of any other people sharing the lease with you.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Letters of reference: </strong>While not mandatory, there are certain communities and property agents that require the submission of a reference letter before they lease out an apartment. These letters need to be signed and dated by the person writing them.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Proof of renters’ insurance: </strong>Renters’ insurance is meant to protect the renters’ belongings in the face of a natural disaster, burglary, or any other kind of damage. This is also a document that&#8217;s requested by many housing societies and dental agencies. Your landlord will let you know beforehand if this document&#8217;s required.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cheque-book, money order, or any other mode of payment. </strong>If you haven’t already paid your first month’s rent/security, this would be the day to do it. Based on your landlord’s preference, you can bring along a mode of payment to your lease appointment.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Vehicle documents/registration: </strong>Apartments in big cities, with limited parking spaces, usually assign a marked parking space to the tenants. So, expect your landlord to ask for your vehicle registration if you&#8217;re renting an apartment in New York in one of those buildings.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ask your landlord about any else that might be required. </strong>This one’s really important. A simple email or text confirming the details of your appointment can save you the trouble of having an entire day wasted over a piece of paper you forgot to carry!</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Who to bring with you during a lease signing:</h3>



<p>During a lease signing, usually only the landlord and tenant is involved. However, there are two more people you could bring with you during the process:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Your Guarantor: </strong>Yes, if your lease has mentioned a guarantor. A guarantor is a cosigner – so their signatures must also be present on the lease. Your guarantor not being present at the lease signing appointment could pose a problem, so re-schedule if need be. This of course is only applicable for in-person signing appointments.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Your Lawyer: </strong>While it’s not necessary to bring along an attorney to a lease signing in New York, some people prefer doing so. It’s frankly just a matter of preference. If you’re not comfortable signing a document without having an attorney look over it, take your lawyer along for the lease signing. If your lawyer can’t be at the venue, you can certainly request your landlord to send a copy of the lease to your lawyer.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Who gets a copy of the lease?</h3>



<p>Ideally, everyone who signed the lease agreement should get a copy of the contract. Tenants should always keep the copies safe, in case they&#8217;re required for reference in the future.</p>



<p>This is also important because some property managers charge the tenant extra to get another copy of the lease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New York Lease Agreements: Finding an Apartment!</h2>



<p>Understanding New York lease agreements for 2024 is crucial for both landlords and tenants. By staying informed about the latest regulations and requirements, you can ensure a smooth and successful leasing process. But before all of this, it&#8217;s necessary to find an apartment in New York to actually sign a lease in, and Roomi can help you out with that.</p>

<p>New York City and Los Angeles are among the most bustling metropolitans in the world. Comparing and trying to choose between two big cities can be a daunting task for anyone. But, fret not, we’re here to make this choice easier for you. You’re definitely in for an exciting journey ahead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NYC vs LA: What is the difference?</strong></h2>



<p>The first difference one cannot go without mentioning is the location of both cities. Located on the two opposite coasts, NYC and LA experience two different geographies and climates.</p>



<p>However, in spite of East Coast vs West Coast, the two cities have more in common than one would think. Whether you’re considering <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/pros-and-cons-of-living-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living in LA</a> or living in NYC, cultural and lifestyle factors and feedback can be subjective.</p>



<p>We’re here to help you make the practical choice. Below, we’ll be answering questions on the differences between housing costs, transportation facilities, safety, job opportunities, and more!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the housing costs?</strong></h3>



<p>Be it living in NYC or living in LA, both cities have an exceptionally high cost of living compared to other cities around the world.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weather in NYC vs LA</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re someone who likes to spend more of their time outdoors, comparing the weather should be high up on your priority list. Considering the different terrains of both cities, the weather tends to follow suit.</p>



<p>In New York City, you get to experience all four seasons. In winters, it’s bitter cold with snow and you must pack your good <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/nyc-winter-essentials-what-should-i-pack-for-new-york-in-winter/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">winter essentials</a>. In the summers, it’s sweltering!</p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/beach-pacific-palisades-california-4694432/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>On the other hand, Los Angeles experiences clear skies, sunshine, and warm weather almost all year long. With the proximity to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/best-beaches-in-la/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful beaches</a>, it is the classic Mediterranean weather. It’s sunny and always a great season for the beach. However, wildfires and earthquakes are also quite frequent.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transportation Facilities in NYC vs LA?</strong></h3>



<p>Thinking about ways to get around the city? The options available in NYC and LA are drastically different.</p>



<p>In the city that never sleeps, you will find plenty of transportation facilities. Buses, subways, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/getting-to-know-nycs-ferry-system-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ferries</a>, and taxis are easily available and almost nobody owns a car. New York is much more walkable and hence, the transportation costs are also lower on average.</p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/pedestrians-crossing-traffic-1853552/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>Los Angeles on the other hand is known as the driver’s city. If you are someone who loves to drive around for everything, choose LA. Despite the heavy traffic, it is a better choice than public transportation. If you don’t own a car, there are plenty of ride-sharing apps.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Job opportunities in both cities</h3>



<p>This is the most important question for modern young professionals. Comparing NYC vs LA, both offer an equal number of job opportunities. Generally speaking, the Big Apple has greater opportunities in the finance sector while LA offers the best jobs in the tech world and entertainment industry.</p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/man-notebook-new-york-businessman-1071770/" class="broken_link"></a></p>



<p>NYC also offers higher-paying jobs, considering the higher costs of living when compared to Los Angeles. However, the decision comes down to the industry and lifestyle that suits you best.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Which <strong>city is safer to live in?</strong></h3>



<p>Considering the crime rate, NYC is considered much safer ever since the 90s. The crime rate has significantly reduced in the past couple of years allowing people to walk more freely around the neighborhoods.</p>



<p>LA however suffers from a higher crime rate with significantly more violent crimes reported in recent years. Even though the LAPD is toiling hard, according to the trends, LA is not for the soft-hearted.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where do I find the best food and lifestyle?</strong></h3>



<p>Both the cities offer plenty of varieties for food lovers. Whether you are a health freak or want world-class cuisines, you get it all. Apart from that, you have plenty of nightclubs, theatres, and entertainment options in both cities.</p>

<p>Living in NYC, you can get the best fast-food chains and top-rated restaurants. With exceptional luxury and low-cost outlets, New York has something for everyone. It is also a city full of diversity and hence, you can get your favorite cuisines in multiple hotspots. The New Yorkers truly know how to work hard and play harder!</p>



<p>Comparatively, Los Angeles has a more laid-back vibe. You will feel a greater sense of relaxation. There is a greater inclination towards spirituality and fitness. Thankfully, that does not translate to a lack of options.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Living in NYC vs Living in LA: How to make the best decision?</strong></h3>



<p>Having gone through the major aspects of both the cities, NYC vs LA is a tough call. When it comes down to living expenses, both cities have their pros and cons. If rent is higher in NYC, the transportation costs are the trade-off in LA.</p>



<p>The weather in LA is better if you love the sunshine. But if you want more variety from time to time, NYC has it all. Yes, it’s a concrete jungle but there are plenty of <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/a-guide-to-the-abundant-outdoors-of-new-york-part-1/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">outdoors to explore</a> as well.</p>



<p>If safety is really a priority for you, NYC is the winner. The strong-knit boroughs of New York are much more welcoming. New Yorkers also take a great amount of pride in the diverse and rich culture.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>

<p>Nestled in New York&#8217;s hilly Southern Tier region near the Pennsylvania border is the city of Binghamton. You&#8217;ll find it in a bowl-shaped valley at the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers. Here&#8217;s basically everything you need to know before you find yourself a room for rent in Binghamton!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Binghamton</h2>



<p>Binghamton is the principal city and cultural center of the Binghamton metropolitan area (also known as Greater Binghamton, or historically the Triple Cities). It is currently home to a quarter-million people. Binghamton, like all of the Southern Tier of New York, lies on the Allegheny Plateau, hence its hilly terrain. Additionally, in the center of the city, the Chenango River feeds into the Susquehanna from the north at Confluence Park. </p>



<p>Similarly, the Binghamton River Trail is a 1.5-mile trail along the Chenango. It specifically runs between Cheri Lindsey Park on the Northside and Confluence Park Downtown.</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/decluttering-101-to-be-or-not-to-be-messy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Decluttering 101: To Be Or Not To Be…Messy</strong></a></p>



<p>The city was the traditional economic center of the region and is home to several historic districts. Additionally, the Railroad Terminal Historic District consists of several factories. It also includes buildings along the railroad line in the northern limits of downtown. Today, while there is a continued concentration of high-tech firms, Binghamton is emerging as healthcare. But that&#8217;s not all, it&#8217;s also an education-focused city, with Binghamton University acting as much of the driving force behind this revitalization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding rooms for rent in Binghamton</h2>



<p>Finding rooms for rent in Binghamton is fairly easy if you&#8217;re looking online, especially through apps and services that cater to personalized needs, like Roomi. With Binghamton, over 1,000 properties on the West Side contribute to the <strong><a href="http://www.abelbennett.kwikfold.com/">Abel Bennett Tract Historic District</a></strong>, mainly made up of residential properties along Riverside Drive.</p>



<p>Away from downtown, most of the buildings are single- and multi-family dwellings, along with low-rise business buildings lining commercial arteries. Along the railroad corridors, several factories, mostly abandoned, rise above the otherwise-uniform landscape.</p>

<p>Binghamton is a major junction in the Interstate Highway System, much as it was during the days of the railroad. Interstate 81, a major north-south route, connects the city to Syracuse and Ontario, as well as to Pennsylvania and Appalachia. Binghamton is also the western terminus of Interstate 88, which gives a direct route to Albany. New York State Route 17, the Southern Tier Expressway, is being upgraded to Interstate 86, and spans the southern border of New York, providing access to New York City, as well as to the western Southern Tier and Erie, Pennsylvania.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Taxis and ZipCar in Binghamton</h3>



<p>Zipcar, the world’s leading car-sharing service, allows members to reserve self-service, on-demand cars for an hourly or day rate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Public Transport in Binghamton</h3>



<p>The city of Binghamton has the same public transport service as all of Broome County. Broome County (BC) Transit provides transit service to students at no additional cost with the swipe of their University ID, as the transportation fee is included in tuition. The bus service has GPS tracking devices linked to applications that display where the buses are at all times and how far they are from any given stop location. But beyond the main bus service, here are some of the other options available to the public.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">GotchaBike in Binghamton</h3>



<p>GotchaBike is a bike share and technology company, to bring 30 GPS-enabled bikes to campus. These bikes are spread out in four locations on the main campus of Binghamton university if students are interested. Bikes may be reserved at no charge for two hours a day and for $5 an hour after the two-hour time period.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Railroad and freight in Binghamton</h3>



<p>Three freight railroads serve Binghamton. Norfolk Southern Railway serves Binghamton with its Southern Tier Main Line (the former Erie Lackawanna mainline) and on the mainline between Albany and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (formerly the Delaware and Hudson Railway). The New York, Susquehanna, and Western Railway maintains lines from Binghamton to Syracuse and Utica, and the Central New York Railroad offers freight service to Port Jervis. Binghamton has no railroad passenger service.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Airport in Binghamton</h3>



<p>The nearest airport to Binghamton is Binghamton (BGM) Airport which is 8.3 miles away. Other nearby airports include Scranton/Wilkes-Barre (AVP) (53.8 miles), Syracuse (SYR) (71.3 miles), Rochester (ROC) (114.5 miles) and Albany (ALB) (117.1 miles).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Population in Binghamton</h2>



<p>Until the mid-1950s, Binghamton saw its population grow rapidly due to its industrial boom, and it was one of the largest 100 cities in the United States between 1890 and 1910. Since 1950, the city has sustained population loss, some of which was the result of suburbanization. Much of the recent population loss has occurred throughout the region and is skewed toward the younger population, resulting in the growth of the relative proportion of the elderly in Broome County.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Art and culture in Binghamton</h2>



<p>With a significant amount of schools around the city, rooms for rent in Binghamton have also seen an increase in rent. This, however, has also contributed to another factor. The region has, in the last several years, developed a growing and pervasive arts scene. These include a large cluster of art galleries and shops centered around downtown Binghamton. These galleries have given rise to the First Friday Art Walk, through the efforts of an association of local artists and merchants in Downtown Binghamton. These events have drawn large crowds downtown since 2004. Artists of local prominence that display or have galleries include photorealist painter Anthony Brunelli, Orazio Salati, and Marla Olmstead, a local child who achieved fame in the art world for her abstract art.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all! There is also The Roberson Museum and Science Center, in the heart of Binghamton, which is home to the Binghamton Visitor&#8217;s Center, the Link Planetarium, and a number of exhibits detailing the culture and history of Greater Binghamton and the Southern Tier.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to Know Long Island</h2>



<p>Long Island is the perfect destination for those who want to get away from the chaos of city life, but don’t want to be too far from it. Close to Manhattan and NYC, Long Island is perfect for young professionals and growing families. The city has everything that you could need, from excellent food and entertainment options to high-ranking schools.</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/is-it-time-for-you-to-move-to-another-city/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Is It Time For You To Move To Another City?</strong></a></p>



<p>Most people live in the city, enjoying the beautiful beaches and calm ambiance while working in the city. Although Long Island has plenty of job opportunities, you’re more likely to find small businesses flourishing in the city, making it highly competitive. Excellent public transport makes it easier to work in different cities. High property taxes, however, can make finding cheap rooms for rent in Long Island a challenging task, but the fantastic view is worth the hassle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding Rooms for Rent in Long Island</h2>



<p>Long Island may sound like a dream, but the living costs are a thing of nightmares. Good school districts, proximity to the beach and NYC, make living in Long Island quite expensive with hefty property taxes. If you’ve never lived with a roommate before, consider trying to find one when you move to this city as average rent in Long Island can be pretty high.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Transit Friendly is Long Island?</h2>



<p>Getting around the city without a car isn&#8217;t impossible, although be prepared for long hours in traffic. It&#8217;s best to familiarise yourself with the city&#8217;s public transport, as you&#8217;re going to be relying on it a lot when travelling to Queens, Manhattan or NYC.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="344" data-attachment-id="13529" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-long-island/attachment/long-island-1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Long-Island-1.jpeg?fit=600%2C344&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,344" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Long-Island-1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Long-Island-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Long-Island-1.jpeg?fit=600%2C344&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Long-Island-1.jpeg?resize=600%2C344&#038;ssl=1" alt="Universities in Long Island" class="wp-image-13529" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Long-Island-1.jpeg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Long-Island-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability</h3>



<p>With a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/NY/New_York/Long_Island_City">walk score of 95</a>, you can complete many errands on foot. However, Long Island is only the 52nd most walkable city in New York which makes the score seem less impressive. Although you can complete smaller tasks on foot, most stores, or entertainment options are a short drive away.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Roads/Traffic</h3>



<p>Traffic in Long Island can give you pause. Due to its proximity to the city, you will face traffic at any time of the day, which increases between 7 am to 9 am in the mornings and between 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm in the evenings. Apart from the hassles of daily traffic, roads in Long Island can be dangerous and accident-prone as well, with Route 25 named the most dangerous road in the city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis</h3>



<p>Long Island has no shortage of taxi services that you can call when you need not get somewhere in a hurry. Uber and Lyft operate in Long Island as well, giving residents plenty of options to choose from. Taxi fares in the city are pretty standard with a base fare of $4.2 with $1.28 for every additional kilometer, and a waiting fare of $27.7 per hour.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Public transportation </h3>



<p>With reliable public transport, owning a car is not a necessity for most residents of long island. The MTA has 8 subway stations in Long Island and a reliable schedule. Brooklyn and Manhattan are only one subway stop away, making this the best transport choice for young professionals who need to travel outside the city for work. Make sure to check the official <a href="https://new.mta.info/maps" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MTA website</a> for the latest updates in subway routes according to COVID-19 guidelines.</p>



<p>With the NYC Ferry’s <a href="https://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/astoria/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astoria route,</a> you can reach Brooklyn from Long Island in 14 minutes, and Manhattan in 7 minutes. The ferry runs multiple times throughout the day and helps connect the residential areas to the business districts across different cities.</p>



<p>Residents can also travel via the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) system, which has 2 stations across the city. With the eTix app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mta-etix/id1104885987" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mta.mobileapp&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a>), you can buy tickets directly from your home. You can <a href="https://new.mta.info/fares-and-tolls/fare-information">plan your trip</a> to check fares before you leave.</p>



<p>Two main bus operators in Long Island are <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nicebus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NICE</a> (Nassau Inter-County Express) operating in Nassau and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sct-bus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suffolk County Operating</a> in Suffolk.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Airports </h3>



<p>The <a href="http://www.macarthurairport.com/">Long Island McArthur Airport</a>, locally referred to as the Islip Airport is the most convenient option for Long Island residents. However, destination and airline options are limited. For those who are traveling internationally, the JFK or <a href="https://www.jfkairport.com/">John F. Kennedy International Airport</a> is the best option. Long Island Residents can take the LIRR to Jamaica and then connect to JFK via the <a href="https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/air-train">AirTrain.</a> If you don’t mind the drive and are flying Delta, <a href="https://www.laguardiaairport.com/">LaGuardia Airport</a> is the one for you, but reaching this airport via public transport can be challenging. The <a href="https://www.newarkairport.com/">Newark Liberty International Airport</a> is in New Jersey and can be your last resort if your airline does not connect to any of the other airports.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Cycling </h3>



<p>Long Island is moderately cycle-friendly with several roads that provide biking infrastructure and have signed routes for biking. However, the city does not have many biking trails or off the road paths for bicyclists. <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/">Citibike</a>, New York’s largest public bike-sharing system, has 74 stations across the city, making biking more accessible for residents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Restaurants in Long Island</h2>



<p>Unlike other cities, you won’t find a dish or cuisine which is unique to Long Island. What you can expect to find, however, are dishes that feature locally grown produce. As <a href="https://www.danspapers.com/2019/01/north-fork-legend-chef-john-ross/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Ross</a> put it, “The ingredients from your backyard drive the cuisine and create the cuisine.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cultural Activities in Long Island</h2>



<p>When you move to Long Island, you will not run out of things to do. Events run throughout the year, giving residents numerous options for an exciting day out. You can also learn more about the city&#8217;s history by visiting museums and the famed <a href="https://www.thirteen.org/program-content/a-guide-to-long-islands-gold-coast-mansions/">Gold Coast mansions</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Taxi</h3>



<p>Taxis are a good way to get around Albany, which operates a zonal fare system (not a uniform table of rates). Because of this, it makes sense to double check any fares before you leave. Further, beware of crossing the city line, as this may incur higher final fares.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Public Transportation</h3>



<p>In Albany, CDTA&#8217;s public transportation network is limited to buses, but they are a useful way to get around. Single fares are $1.50 ($4 for a day pass), and be aware that the weekend services can be extremely limited.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Car</h3>



<p>Albany is a fantastic place to rent a car. Not only can you get around town easily, but it opens up the whole Hudson Valley and the Adirondacks and Catskills for exploration. Car rental outlets in town include Hertz, Avis, and Enterprise, and typical rates are around $15-20 per day for smaller models.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Bike share</h3>



<p>With CDPHP Cycle, rent a bicycle (for $5 an hour) and ride it all around the region — if you can get that far. You’ll find these bike stations throughout the Capital Region. Here’s a <a href="https://cdphpcycle.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of locations</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cultural activities in Albany</h2>



<p>The town itself always rewards those who live there, with the stunning New York State Capitol building and the elegant storefronts of Main Street. But there’s so much more!</p>

</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Whale Watching</h3>



<p>Albany was home to this country’s last operating Whaling Station, and it’s not hard to see why.&nbsp;The area plays host to Humpback and Southern Right whale migrations from May to October every year, with fantastic viewing spots all along the coast line of the area.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">National ANZAC Centre</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anzacalbany/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">National ANZAC Centre</a> is a state-of-the-art museum blending multimedia. It displays interactive exhibits and historical artifacts examining the Australian and New Zealand forces that served in World War I.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bluff Knoll</h3>



<p>If you’re seeking an adventure and some magnificent views, Bluff Knoll is for you! As the highest point in the South West, Bluff Knoll is a very popular spot. As a rite of passage for many West Australians, it’s a fun experience given the lack of big mountain ranges in the state.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nightlife in Albany</h2>



<p>From trivia nights and&nbsp;cornhole tournaments with locals, to handcrafted cocktails at a hidden speakeasy, there is no shortage of things to do in Albany once the sun goes down.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Head down to the emerging Warehouse District and discover Albany&#8217;s booming craft beverage industry.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Staying indoors for too long has made us all dream of seeking more in the outside world when we can finally be out there again. Maybe it&#8217;s a hobby or a skill you&#8217;re aiming to work on and develop. Or if you&#8217;re looking at public universities in New York state for college degrees, we definitely feel you! Although, learning a skill or picking up a hobby doesn&#8217;t come with a high cost, getting a degree does! So if you have decided to enroll yourself in college, we&#8217;re proud of you and we wish to help! Here&#8217;s all you need to know about the costs of public colleges in New York.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First thing&#8217;s first: Is public college free in New York?</h2>



<p>In brief, it&#8217;s a little complicated.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, public colleges in New York became much more accessible with the rollout of the Excelsior Scholarship program. The program proposed to cover four years of tuition. That too, without being tethered to academic performance at public universities in New York state.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/12/free-college-now-a-reality-in-these-states.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC reported</a>,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>The scholarship applies to all schools and public colleges in New York and State University of New York. The government stated that more than 940,000 middle-class families and individuals making up to $125,000 per year will qualify when the program completes its three-year phase-in in 2020. However, you should keep in mind that the program does not cover the cost of books or room and board, and other <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-you-should-know-about-living-with-roommates-in-college/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living</a> expenses.</p></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some of the requirements that make you eligible for the Excelsior scholarship are:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>You need to be New York state residents.</li><li>As a student, you should attend a SUNY or CUNY two- or four-year program at public universities in New York state.</li><li>You need to take 30 credits per calendar year (including January and summer sessions).</li><li>You should plan to live and work in New York following graduation. And for at least as long as the time you participate in the scholarship program.</li></ul>



<p>For a more detailed view of requirements, you can visit <a href="https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/financial-aid/types-of-financial-aid/nys-grants-scholarships-awards/the-excelsior-scholarship/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">NYC&#8217;s government website</a>.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/04/08/pf/college/new-york-free-tuition/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN reported</a>,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Those eligible will pay nothing for tuition at public colleges in New York, which costs $6,470 annually at four-year schools and about $4,350 a year at community colleges. But they will still be on the hook for the cost of fees and room and board if they live on campus. Those other expenses can add up to $14,000 a year.</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Okay, but how is it complicated?</h2>



<p>Well, like everything else, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-live-life-to-the-fullest-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the pandemic</a> has complicated all the areas of our collective lives!</p>



<p>The Excelsior program was a program that filled students with hopes for a cheaper public college education in New York. But sadly, according to the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation, which runs the state’s Excelsior Scholarship, the pandemic has caused a dramatic reduction in state revenues and, as a result, the processing of new applications has been delayed since April 2020.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what are other options for financial aid at public colleges in New York?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">FAFSA</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/heres-how-to-get-more-financial-aid-for-college-amid-the-pandemic.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">As per CNBC</a>, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, serves as the gateway to all federal money, including loans, work-study, and grants, which are the most desirable kind of assistance. For the 2021-2022 school year, the FAFSA filing season opens Oct. 1 — and, for the most part, the sooner students file, the better.</p>



<p>In addition, keep in mind that financial aid for public universities in New York state is calculated based on a family’s income from two years earlier. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Student loans</h3>



<p>We&#8217;ve all seen the memes and talk in the media about student loans and the misery of it. But if your desire for education at public colleges in New York is insurmountable. And if you plan your finances and future prospects well, you can consider this as a good option. The most important first step being, to educate yourself all you can about the options available and how you can get the best value out of them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/learning/student-journey/college-and-career-planning/paying-for-college" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the NYC school government website</a>, here are some things you should keep in mind.</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Before you sign for any loan, make sure you ask questions. Find out when you or your family must start paying the money back and how much interest you will have to pay. Ask your college and career counselor at your school or a financial aid officer for help if you do not understand the loan documents.</li><li>You can also visit an&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/consumers/get-free-financial-counseling.page" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">NYC Financial Empowerment Center</a>&nbsp;for free 1:1 financial counseling.</li><li>A <strong>Direct Subsidized Perkins Loan</strong> is a Federal student loan that has a lower interest rate. Students do not have to start paying this loan back until after they graduate from college. However, students do have to start paying if they decide to leave school.</li><li><strong>Federal Direct Plus Loans</strong> for parents have higher interest rates than Direct Subsidized Loans for students. Additionally, the loan accrues interest right away, and a credit check is necessary to apply.</li></ul>



<p>And last but not least, here&#8217;s a <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">helpful government website</a> to know your options for public colleges in New York. All you have to do is go to the webpage and type your desired college or field of study. It will give you details on the colleges and public universities in New York state to help you decide which one&#8217;s the right fit for you!</p>



<p>Good luck.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests knowing what you exactly want in terms of accommodation when living on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re going to spend the most on rent and it&#8217;s not going to be frugal. You just have to be honest with yourself about what you want and you&#8217;re going to have to pay for it. The more roommates you have, the less you&#8217;ll pay. So remember that when you chart your living expenses budget in New York.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hyperside89 says you need to accept that rent is going to be your highest expense</h3>



<p>Rent is going to be your highest expense. Accept it, don&#8217;t fret over it. Some people will tell you to live in a place you don&#8217;t feel safe, or to cram 5 people in a two bedroom apartment to save money (slight exaggeration). Don&#8217;t do it. If your home is a place you want to be you&#8217;ll spend more time there, aka not being out spending money. I just spend the entire Sunday in my apartment cooking, reading, etc. Didn&#8217;t spend a dime. My rent is $1,100 a month (+ $40-60 on utilities) and so worth it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests moving to Manhattan for living on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>Move to Manhattan My BF and I live in the UWS and are moving next month. We have signed papers for a place in Harlem &#8211; it is up and coming and super convenient train-wise. Safe and very neighborhood-y. We will only be spending $1500 for a 1BR which is SUPER CHEAP. We will be able to afford to buy a used car soon and parking is also affordable up there. I love the neighborhood and it is totally worth looking into for living on a budget in New York.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage speaks the truth about commuting on a budget in New York</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re going to spend the same amount on the subway as everyone else and there&#8217;s also nothing you can do about it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user Artichokeowl suggests knowing for sure how often you&#8217;d <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hacks-to-the-subway-in-nyc-we-all-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the subway</a></h3>



<p>One thing that helps is thinking about how often you will really need to take the subway or bus. If you know for SURE that you&#8217;ll need to take it to and from work/school every single day, go for the monthly pass. If you think you&#8217;ll take it less often, decide how you want to do it by figuring out how much you pay per trip given how often you take the subway with the different metrocard options. This is the best way to live on a budget in New York.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests Brooklyn for <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/frugal-living-how-to-get-groceries-on-a-budget-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">grocery shopping</a></h3>



<p>If you go to deep Brooklyn for your groceries you&#8217;ll save soooooo much money. It&#8217;s awesome how cheap it is.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests Trader Joe&#8217;s</h3>



<p>Really worth the wait because every other place seems overpriced when living on a budget in New York. Just buy a granny cart and play sudoku on your phone. For the two of us, I only spend ~$120/month there.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hyperside89 says cooking will save you tons of money</h3>



<p>Cook to live on a budget in New York. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/10-life-lessons-learned-from-cooking-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cooking</a> will save you SO MUCH MONEY. Don&#8217;t even worry about seeking out the cheapest groceries in the city. I shop at my local grocery store which has average prices and I only pay $180 a month in groceries. Don&#8217;t go crazy on caviar, etc and don&#8217;t go to Whole Foods for everything and you&#8217;ll be fine. For context, I do eat a primarily vegetarian / vegan diet heavy on veggies but not exclusively.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz also suggests cooking instead of eating out or ordering in</h3>



<p>Honestly, the food sucks for the price anyway. If my $50 meal was $20, I would buy it. But it&#8217;s actually $50 and very overpriced. I spend my money on nice food I cook at home. We eat out at quality restaurants once or twice a month. That way we sample a bunch of places and really look forward to it when living on a budget in New York.</p>



<p>On the same note, no take out.&nbsp;Resist. Save for snowy days when you are sick and there is a HIMYM marathon on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fitting everything else in your budget in New York</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user linsage suggests their choice of money saving apps and other financial management tips</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>There are AMAZING <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-best-money-saving-apps-to-reach-your-finance-goals/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">apps for saving money</a> on various nyc happenings and restaurants. ScoutMob and Savored are my favorites for living on a budget in New York.</li>



<li>Drink before you go out if you want to save money on going out. Don&#8217;t go to places with cover charges.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s not easy to live on a budget in New York. But if you want to live here, you&#8217;ll make it work. Who needs a retirement fund anyway?</li>



<li>Edit: also Amazon Prime for all your shopping</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reddit user hollyholidayz suggests investing in memberships</h3>



<p>I roller skate, enjoy French films and picnics during the summer. Thus, I purchase loyalty/membership cards to the rink and film festivals. I enjoy these things and buy them at rates so I can do them often, on the cheap. It is important to do things you enjoy and spend your money right when you&#8217;re living on a budget in New York.</p>

<p>Honest you CAN live within your budget in New York. My suggestion is to really really save as much as possible. Put away as much as you can. A job is really important to have once you get here because if you don&#8217;t you will eat into your savings damn fast. Happened to me. Had a place but couldn&#8217;t get a job for around 2-3 months. Really hard on my savings.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s super possible! It can just be hard.</p>



<p>Quick breakdown of my expenses per month:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rent: $560</li>



<li>Utilities: $75-$100</li>



<li>Phone: $100</li>



<li>Metro: $120</li>



<li>Food: $150-$200</li>
</ul>



<p>Some months are better than others. Sometimes I get lucky and make my payments on time, other times no. So don&#8217;t be afraid or ashamed to ask for help if you need it.</p>

<p>When in NYC, you&#8217;ve got to dress like a New Yorker! If you&#8217;re planning a trip to visit New York over the Holiday Season, gurl &#8211; bundle up! New York&#8217;s infamous winter chill can literally quote, unquote,&nbsp;<em>freeze you</em>&nbsp;if you&#8217;re not packing mindfully. Especially for someone who&#8217;s coming from a place where it doesn&#8217;t snow. Personally, I feel winter is like the best time to visit NYC! Why? Because NYC Christmas is like no other, and everyone should witness it at least once in their lifetime. However, if you&#8217;re not prepared for the cold, you will be unable to experience its true beauty. So without further ado, here&#8217;s a survival guide with NYC winter essentials to prep you for the sweater weather.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Open your suitcase and add the following NYC Winter essentials!</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Warmers</h3>



<p>Layering is key! Especially if you want to survive the NYC winter! However, layering can be quite difficult if your sweaters are all thick &amp; heavily knit. I mean the last thing you want to do is end up looking like a fine lookin&#8217; pumpkin on your 2021 vacation. Unless that&#8217;s the look you&#8217;re going for. So do this instead &#8211; invest in good quality warmers. Not only do they keep you super snug, but you can also slide them under your favorite outfits with ease.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Winter Jacket</h3>



<p>Now that you have your warmer, the next item on our list of NYC winter essentials is a warm winter jacket. Invest in a coat or a parka with a hoodie that comes till your mid-thigh(at least).

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Comfortable sneakers</h4>



<p>Ask any New Yorker what their favorite mode of transport is, and they will say &#8216;walking&#8217;! No, seriously, that &amp; the subway. I know that Carrie Bradshaw had us believe that we could walk anywhere in the six-inch heels. But it&#8217;s not a practical choice. So you want to pack sneakers that allow you to stay comfy around the clock.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">NYC Winter Essentials: Boots</h4>



<p>No winter survival guide is complete without the staple winter boots. You need a functional pair that&#8217;s waterproof &amp; comfortable. Please skip bringing any cutesy ballerinas, heels, or fancy suede footwear! They will end up getting wet &amp; dirty in the snow, leaving you to fend for yourself barefoot.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. A comfortable bag</h3>



<p>To enjoy NYC for all its beauty &amp; traveling within the city you need a bag to add all your travel essentials. New York is an expensive city, so you want to carry things that don&#8217;t let you exceed your budget and helps you explore the city comfortably. I personally like to carry a backpack that can accommodate my camera and other NYC winter essentials like:</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Water bottle</h4>



<p>Stay hydrated on the go with a leak-proof water bottle. Additionally, I also like to carry an insulated water bottle for my caffeine fix. It helps me save on the crazy coffee charges that can go anywhere between $5 to $20.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Lip Balm</h4>



<p>Cold winters and chapped lips are like that cringe couple that loves to PDA. It&#8217;s hard to break &#8217;em up unless you have a lip balm that believes in third-wheeling like a boss.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Portable Charger</h4>



<p>Don&#8217;t you hate it when you see a beautiful scene, and before you can capture it, your battery dies. This honestly has happened to me(even as a local) way more than I&#8217;d like to accept. Anywho, as a traveler, you need it more than anyone &#8211; <strong>for beautiful snaps + google maps</strong>. There&#8217;s nothing worse than getting lost in a new city w/o a map.

<p>Living in New York City can be an exhilarating and rewarding experience, but it can also come with a hefty price tag. Whether you&#8217;re a student, a young professional, or just looking to supplement your income, finding ways to make extra money in NYC can feel like a daunting task. But, there are plenty of opportunities waiting for you in the city that never sleeps.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore eight different ways you can make some extra cash by working part-time. From freelance gigs to sharing economy platforms, these options are sure to get you excited about the possibilities of earning more in the Big Apple. So let&#8217;s dive in and explore the many ways you can fatten your wallet and make the most of your time in NYC!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-extra-ways-to-make-money-in-nyc">8 Extra Ways to Make Money in NYC</h2>



<p>Especially if you’re starting by yourself professionally and don’t have much to fall back on, the financial stress is real! You’ve got to find that side hustle! Check out these part-time jobs in New York to make some extra cash.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-drive-for-uber-or-taskrabbit"><strong>1. Drive for Uber or TaskRabbit</strong></h3>



<p>If you don’t mind driving around NYC – given the crowded streets and rush-hour madness – you can consider driving people or goods across the city. It works best if you have a car, but you can rent one too.</p>



<p>If you’re sure that moody customers can’t get through your bubble of Zen, you’ll make a great Uber or Lyft driver, picking a schedule you&#8217;re okay with. You can also deliver groceries or packages through FreshDirect or TaskRabbit.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what else you can do:</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Deliver food for UberEats, GrubHub, Doordash, Eat24, etc.</li>



<li>Deliver clothes for ByNext.</li>



<li>Deliver packages with Amazon Flex.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<p>New York has enough customers for all these services to have constant delivery needs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-pet-sit-or-walk-dogs"><strong>2. Pet-sit or walk dogs</strong></h3>



<p>If you like pets, this is a great part-time job for you! There are many New Yorkers who have beloved dogs, but no time to take them for walks. Some dog owners pay good money for someone knowledgeable about dogs to take their pet for a walk and make sure it gets exercise and playtime.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on the owner’s cat, dog, or bird (and let’s hope it’s nothing more dangerous), feed them, give them their meds, etc. Find your side gig on pet-sitting websites like Pet Sitters International or Pet Sitting NYC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-freelance-for-small-businesses"><strong>3. Freelance for small businesses</strong></h3>



<p>The big, diverse city of New York has many small businesses popping up every day. They all have requirements for amateurs and side hustlers like photographers, blog writers, social media managers, graphic designers, web developers, etc.</p>

<p>Create a website portfolio, however basic, so prospective hirers can understand what you do. Most work will be simple, but the core team just won’t have enough time or enough expertise to make a good job out of it.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can find other freelancing jobs to do remotely for people from across the country. For both kinds of gigs, keep checking career websites like&nbsp;LinkedIn or Indeed.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Become a personal chef</strong></h3>



<p>This is a great side gig for that extra cash if you&#8217;re good at cooking and enjoy the task. The busy lifestyle of New Yorkers doesn&#8217;t allow time to cook for themselves. However, most residents are highly concerned about their health and are eager to improve it.</p>



<p>Sign up on websites that act as a platform between people looking for food and people who cook. Depending on your schedule and the client’s needs, you can decide what meals you can cook for them.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Become a personal trainer or a coach</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re into physical activities and sports, you can become a personal coach for people looking for a range of different services. Since the pandemic, a lot more people have opted to do workouts from home through YouTube or by hiring a personal coach.</p>



<p>So, if you can coach someone for activities like home workouts and running in the parks, this is a good time for you. Sign up on platforms like&nbsp;CoachUp&nbsp;where you can meet clients and like-minded coaches.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Babysit or House sit</h3>



<p>Babysitting is a classic way to make extra money and the role of a babysitter is very commonly seen in popular movies and TV shows. But remember, babysitting is a serious job too! You&#8217;ll have to spend time and care for babies and children, make sure they&#8217;re fed, bathed, and put into bed at the right time.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>So, make sure that before your first babysitting job, do some research on your own and talk to the parents about the child you&#8217;re babysitting. It&#8217;s better to be prepared!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Do private classes or tutoring online</h3>



<p>There are a lot more opportunities online now, so one way to make extra money in NYC is to offer your tutoring services. You can start by messaging your contacts, broadcasting your services on social media and tutoring platforms, and applying to different job offers that are looking for an online teacher.</p>



<p>Just make sure that you’re knowledgeable on the subject or topic that you’ll be teaching, whether it’s math, science, or <a href="https://brighterly.com/reading-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading classes</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">8. Buy and resell stuff</h3>



<p>Buying and selling takes a lot of work, but if you have the eye for hunting for things that could still be used, maybe this is the extra work for you. You just have to ensure that the things you&#8217;re buying can actually sell or are still in good condition to be housed by another person.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Ways to Make Extra Money in NYC: Final Word</h2>

<p>New York is an incredible place to live in. It&#8217;s even more exciting when you&#8217;re living in Manhattan, New York, with a bunch of roommates that share the same interests as you!</p>



<p>The cherry on top is <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/new-york-guide-the-five-famous-boroughs-roomi/">all five boroughs of New York City have something exciting to offer</a>. They have tons of their own charm. You&#8217;re bound to find culture and history and an inspiring amount of diversity here — no matter where you&#8217;re from!</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t feel like getting out? Here are <em><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/8-fascinating-documentaries-about-new-york-roomi/">8 Fascinating Documentaries About New York That Will Give You A Taste Of The Greatest City On Earth</a></em></p>



<p>That being said, if you&#8217;re living in New York with your roommates, ever so often you&#8217;re going to come across a weekend where you&#8217;re all free. On days like these, we recommend having a fun day out to explore the city on your terms! (All while taking the necessary precautions, of course ?)</p>



<p>Given Manhattan&#8217;s size, it&#8217;s going to take you some time to explore everything that this part of NYC represents. So by no means are we saying that this is an exhaustive list. (Here&#8217;s us winking at a definite part 2)</p>



<p>Anyhoo, here are some of the best things to do with your roommates in Manhattan!</p>

<p>This is one of the newer attractions in Manhattan, situated at Hudson Yards. Opened in 2019, this stunning sculpture is 150-foot high and made in the shape of a beehive. It&#8217;s made up of stairways and platforms and adds quite the picturesque elegance to Manhattan&#8217;s silhouette.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.in/content/new-york-hudson-yards-the-vessel-thomas-heatherwick/">Thomas Heatherwick’s unique installation found its inspiration in the ancient stepwells of India</a> — where over a hundred flights of stairs descend dramatically deep into the earth.</p>



<p>The 2500 steps you&#8217;ll find here are the equivalent of 15 storeys — making this an attraction you must add to your &#8216;<em>things to do when in New York&#8217;</em> list. But also ensure you and your roommates are donning the right footwear!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s so much you can do in Manhattan with your roommates. But nothing beats letting the mystique of New York sink in from this viewpoint.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a stunning view of the Empire State Building that you can catch from here too.</p>



<p>However, make sure to pre-book your tickets, especially if you want to watch the sunset from here. <a href="https://www.topoftherocknyc.com/ticket-menu/" class="broken_link">Tickets cost anything between $36-$75, depending on if you want VIP access.</a> There&#8217;s also Rockefeller Center tours you can book when you&#8217;re here!</p>

<p>Located not too far from the Empire State Building, this library sings (cue jazz music) the legacy of J. P. Morgan. This was once a private facility that was turned into a library and museum after his death, per J.P. Morgan&#8217;s will.</p>



<p>Visitors pay a relatively small fee for entrance and it&#8217;s completely worth it! It&#8217;s one of the best ways to catch a break if you and your roommates are looking to catch a break from the hustle and bustle of New York&#8217;s streets.</p>

<p>Sure you could visit Times Square just for kicks but, don&#8217;t. Unless you&#8217;re a tourist and you absolutely want to. Instead, take yourself to walk the Highline.</p>



<p>Easily one of the best things to do in Manhattan, this gem is made using issued metro lines. These metro lines have been transformed into a green walkway. Go here to get a spectacular escape from the streets of NYC on a sunny day.</p>



<p>This 1.45 mile-long elevated linear park is sure to add the most New York-esque charm to your day out with your roommates!</p>

<p>A mandatory spot after a stroll at the Highline, Bubby&#8217;s serves the brunch of all our dreams. Think Southern comfort. Good old fashioned homely southern cooking is their forte.</p>



<p>And they&#8217;ve made it to one too many &#8220;hidden gems of NYC&#8221; lists as well as movies — so don&#8217;t let anything stop you from getting a scrumptious meal here.</p>



<p>Their website has some insanely drool-worthy images of pancakes and pies. And they have at least two locations in Manhattan alone!</p>

<p>Eerie doesn&#8217;t quite capture the eeriness of this place. A little further away from Manhattan, this hospital is one of New York&#8217;s most haunted spots.</p>



<p>&#8220;*In New York City, the southern tip of Blackwell’s Island (now Roosevelt Island) provided ferry access but kept the infected patients far away from the population. Better known for Grace Church on Broadway and St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Madison Avenue, James Renwick Jr. designed the smallpox hospital in his Gothic Revival style. From 1856 until 1875, the hospital treated about 7,000 patients a year.</p>



<p>In 1875, the building was converted into a nurses’ dormitory, and the city smallpox hospital was moved to North Brothers Island, in part because Blackwell’s Island had become more densely populated. By the 1950s, Renwick Hospital had become useless and was abandoned by the city, quickly falling into disrepair.</p>



<p>However, in 1975, the Landmarks Preservation Commission took interest in the dilapidated structure and declared it, in its ruin, a city landmark. They reinforced the walls to prevent it from completely falling apart but have not renovated it or opened it for tours. Only some of the outer walls and the foundation remain today. It is behind a fence on the southern tip of Roosevelt Island.&#8221;</p>

<p>This haunted hospital building is accessible from Manhattan via tramway or subway. It&#8217;s also quite justly known as New York&#8217;s most chilling attractions.</p>



<p>So if you and your roommates are like us and love getting a whiff of some scares every now and then, this is the spot to chill at. (That ghostly pun is most definitely intended ?)</p>
