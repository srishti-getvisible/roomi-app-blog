<p>When it comes to living with an international roommate, the experience is like a coin with two sides—each with its own set of perks and challenges.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s chat about what makes this journey so special, and what bumps you might find along the way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pros</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cultural enrichment:</strong> Imagine celebrating Diwali, Christmas, and Chinese New Year all in one apartment! Living with someone from a different culture turns your home into a mini global village. You get a firsthand look at traditions, foods, and daily practices that books or documentaries can barely do justice to.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Language practice:</strong> Ever wanted to learn Spanish, French, or Mandarin but found classes too dull or expensive? Well, if your roommate speaks a different language, it’s a great opportunity to practice or learn a new language. It&#8217;s much more engaging and fun to learn by conversing daily than through books or apps alone</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Expanding your perspectives:</strong> Discussing world events with someone from another country can open your eyes to different perspectives. It encourages open-mindedness and can challenge preconceived notions you might have about other cultures.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>New friends and connections:</strong>: Having a foreign roommate often means they might have friends from other countries too. This can expand your social circle and introduce you to a diverse group of people you might not have met otherwise. It can be particularly valuable if you’re looking into working or studying abroad.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cons</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Different daily routines:</strong> Your idea of early might be their idea of a sleep-in. Maybe your roommate comes from a culture where dinner at 10 PM is the norm, while you’re used to eating by 6 PM. These differences in daily routines can be quirky at first, but frustrating if not navigated carefully.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Communication hiccups:</strong> Even if you both speak the same language, certain nuances and expressions can lead to misunderstandings. Sometimes, what’s considered a harmless joke in one culture can be a rude remark in another. It’s all about navigating these nuances with care and a good dose of humor.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Privacy issues:</strong> In some cultures, it’s normal to enter someone’s room without knocking, while in others, such privacy invasions could lead to World War III in the apartment! Setting clear boundaries that respect both your privacy is key.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Household habits:</strong> Cultural differences can extend to everyday habits and lifestyles, from cleaning standards to cooking smells, noise levels, and even the way you spend your leisure time. What’s normal in one culture (like leaving dishes overnight) might be a no-go in another. This might require adjustments and compromises that not everyone is comfortable with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, here are some practical tips to help you navigate the rewarding yet complex dynamics of living with someone from a different cultural background.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Explore with your international roommate</h3>



<p>A new city or country often means new stores and chains you don’t recognize. For your international roommate, it could be quite a culture shock.</p>



<p>Take time to get to know the city together. Find a favorite grocery store, try a couple of happy hours, and just explore the neighborhood with your roommate even if you aren’t best friends (yet).</p>



<p>After you’re done raiding the local farmer’s market, schedule a night to&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/roommate-bonding-activities/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">try cooking a new dish</a>&nbsp;—maybe you’ll discover a new favorite you’ve never heard of before!</p>



<p>Trust us — while it seems like a small gesture, it will help your new roommate feel at home.</p>



<p>This goes both ways, though! They might have some killer recs for you too. Never tried Ethiopian food? Who better to show you exactly how to eat that spongy bread than a local?</p>



<p>And if you and your international roommate have any sort of language barrier, just remember: Food is the universal language.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Share cultural norms</h3>



<p>When it comes to sharing stuff, it’s always&nbsp;<a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/co-living/how-to-survive-your-first-living-with-roommates-experience/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="broken_link">best to ask</a>&nbsp;— whether it’s food or toiletries, don’t just assume it’s yours to use.</p>



<p>Hopefully, you’re doing that anyway, but sharing habits aren’t always so common sense. Americans, for example, might be more casual about “borrowing” something than someone from abroad.</p>



<p>Wherever you stand on the sharing thing, it’s best to talk about it early on to avoid any misunderstandings on either of your part. The last thing you want is to sour your relationship with your international roommate over some grapes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Be&nbsp;crystal clear about what’s ‘included’</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s super important to be transparent about what&#8217;s included in your living arrangement.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t just about the rent and bills—though those are key—it&#8217;s about all the little (and not so little) things that can cause misunderstandings if they&#8217;re not spelled out from the get-go.</p>



<p>For example, let&#8217;s talk about the basics like utilities. Are all utilities included in the rent, or will you and your roommate be splitting the costs of things like electricity, water, and internet? This should be laid out clearly to avoid any surprises when the bills start rolling in.</p>



<p>But beyond the financials, you should also discuss what living essentials are shared and what aren&#8217;t. Will you be sharing food, or is everyone on their own for meals?</p>



<p>What about cleaning supplies or bathroom essentials like toilet paper—will these be communal expenses, or is everyone expected to pitch in separately?</p>



<p>And here&#8217;s one that often gets overlooked: space usage. Be clear about which areas are communal and which are private. Can you both use the living room for hanging out or hosting friends? Who gets which shelves in the fridge?</p>



<p>These might seem like small details, but they can lead to big headaches if they&#8217;re not hashed out upfront.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Use a good app</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re moving to a new country and need some navigating the rental landscape, having the right tools can make all the difference.</p>



<p>This is where a reliable international roommate finder like <a href="https://roomiapp.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Roomi</a> steps in. Roomi isn’t just another platform to find a place to live; it connects you to a vibrant community of renters who are actively looking to share their living spaces.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don’t assume anything</h3>



<p>Assumptions can be the quickest route to misunderstandings. When you live with someone from a different cultural background, try to avoid jumping to conclusions based on your cultural norms.</p>



<p>For example, if your roommate doesn’t share much about their personal life, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re unfriendly. Some cultures value privacy and might take longer to open up.</p>



<p>Always ask and communicate instead of assuming; this will help you avoid many potential conflicts and help you understand your roommate’s actions and responses better.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Make intros</h3>



<p>Hopefully, you and your new international roommate can find some common ground to let a friendship bloom.</p>



<p>But even if you’re not the best of buds, you might be able to introduce them to their next BFF — making you Roommate of the Year!</p>



<p>So get on your Facebook/Instagram/X (or any other social media platform you use) and make some intros. It&#8217;ll be the easiest thing you can do with the largest payoff.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Avoid using stereotypes</h3>



<p>It’s also important for you to recognize and avoid relying on stereotypes when interacting with your international roommate.</p>



<p>It’s way better to get to know your roommate as a person. Ask them about their interests, their family, what a typical day looked like for them back home, or their favorite music.</p>



<p>You’ll likely find that they’re much more than any stereotype could cover. Plus, this kind of open curiosity may help you build a more genuine and respectful relationship.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve moved in with your new roommate, and things are mostly going great. But then, little things start popping up—maybe it&#8217;s dishes left in the sink longer than you&#8217;d like, or the bathroom becomes a free-for-all during your morning routine.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to think, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll just let it slide this time,&#8221; but those little annoyances can quickly snowball into major irritations if they aren&#8217;t addressed.</p>



<p>The trick here is to bring up issues while they&#8217;re still small. You might worry about coming off as naggy, but it&#8217;s really about keeping your shared space comfortable for everyone.</p>



<p>If you notice something, say something (in a polite way, of course.) Your roommate might not even realize they&#8217;re doing something that bugs you. People have different living habits, and what’s obvious to you might not be to someone else.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">9. Be patient</h3>



<p>Living with a foreign roommate may test your patience in all sorts of ways. Think about it: each of us grows up with our own set of norms, and it can take a minute to adjust when someone else’s norms crash into ours.</p>



<p>However, showing a bit of patience can make things much easier. It allows everyone some breathing room to adjust and find common ground. Remember — just like you’re adapting to their quirks, they’re adjusting to yours.</p>



<p>Showing patience gives you time to understand and respect your roommate&#8217;s needs and preferences and vice versa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wrapping Up</h2>



<p>And there you have it! Living with an international roommate goes beyond just sharing a space—it&#8217;s about sharing experiences, learning from each other, and growing together in unexpected ways.</p>



<p>With these tips in your back pocket, you&#8217;re all set to make the most of this unique living arrangement.</p>



<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stories are often told of two strangers living together and becoming the best of friends. It is said becoming roommates with friends should be avoided to keep what they have. But let&#8217;s take a closer look at this strange phenomena to decide. Should you be moving in with your friend? There are three sides to every situation. Let&#8217;s consider the good, bad, and reality of living with a friend.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b><strong>Pros</strong></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> of moving in with your friend </strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No roommate hunt, no awkward first meetings, no roommate interviews. Friends, for the most part, know each other. You understand your friends habits already and you may have experience <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-resolve-conflicts-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resolving conflicts</a> with each other. Living with a friend can reduce stress exponentially. You always have someone near who not only knows you, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you. There comes a time among roommates where you need favors, or to borrow almond milk until you can make it to the store. Moving in with your friend makes the asking part that much easier. Living with a friend is comfortable and makes it twice as easy to maintain your traditional nights of Chinese takeout and Netflix originals. What is better than spring rolls and House of Cards&#8230;right?</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>Cons </b>of moving in with your friend</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, how the truest of colors will shine when moving in with your friend! Three weeks into your new lifestyle living with a friend, you wake up realizing it&#8217;s not just the world&#8217;s longest sleepover. <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/matthew-vega/2015/01/5-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-move-in-with-your-best-friend/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facing issues with a friend</a> that you live with can be intimidating. You walk the fine line of commitment over conflict. With a typical roommate, confrontation can be a lot easier to face. After all, you’re not too concerned if a stranger likes you or not. With a friend, it can be tempting to withhold communication around an issue because you don’t want to be another failed attempt at being roommates with a friend. But you’ve watched your leftovers disappear one too many times, and things aren’t looking so good anymore.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>The rea</b>lity of living with a friend</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality of moving with your friend is you’ll be fine. You friendship will grow in some areas and perhaps suffer in others. It’s 12 months and anything is manageable for a year. At the very worst the friendship ends when the lease expires, and should that be the case maybe it wasn’t the strongest of bonds anyway. But when you become roommates with your friends, you’ll most likely just pick up each other’s weird habits and have new found appreciation for one another.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When moving to a new city, you take into consideration things like potential job opportunities, affordable housing, and the social scene. While working your dream job may be your top priority, finding ways to enjoy your time off comes in as a tight second. While you may assume you need to jump on a plane and fly across the world to explore, don’t forget about the endless adventures to be had in your backyard. And who better to experience them with than your co-living partner in crime? Baltimore roommates are among the lucky ones, who won’t have to leave town just to get away. Here’s just a short list of how you and your roommate can enjoy an awesome staycation in Charm City. So if you don&#8217;t have roommates, it&#8217;s time to use a roommate finder in Baltimore. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A staycation for Baltimore roommates</h2>



<p>In brief, a staycation refers to a vacation that doesn’t involve traveling. But rather spending time close to home and enjoying local attractions in your own city. It’s the perfect way to embrace a new city or neighborhood. Or even discover the unknown in a place you’ve been in for a while. The charming city of Baltimore has something for friends, lovers, and families to enjoy year-round, all in its very own Inner Harbor. So gather your Baltimore roommates and get ready to enjoy a lovely staycation. And if you&#8217;re looking for roommates, get that roommate finder in Baltimore out and search for the person to celebrate staycations!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">For the animal lovers</h3>



<p>The Inner Harbor is known to most as a port of call for cruise ships. But the Harbor is also a landmark for the city of Baltimore and a major tourist attraction just waiting for locals to enjoy. One of the most popular attractions at the harbor is the National Aquarium. With over 20,000 aquatic animals, there’s surely a creature or two you’ve never seen before. Baltimore roommates will love the aquarium’s newest exhibit, the Living Seashore, which has become the hot spot for guests, says Kate Rowe, Director of Media Relations at The National Aquarium.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Moreover, this exhibit showcases a mid-Atlantic seashore habitat and features two large touch pools where guests can actually walk up and touch the animals (with proper guidance from our team),” explains Rowe.</p></blockquote>



<p>Some of the animals in this exhibit include Atlantic stingrays, sea stars, horseshoe crabs, and moon jellies. The staff works hard to create engaging experiences that are inspiring for all guests. So time to take your animal loving Baltimore roommates for the best possible staycation ever! </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“From tactile learning in our new touch pool exhibit and fully immersive experiences in our rain forest and Australia exhibits, to our close to 40 daily talks with animal care staff…there’s something for everyone at the Aquarium! It’s a place to build and make connections,” she adds.</p></blockquote>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Looking for a deal? We&#8217;ve got you! </h4>



<p>They also offer great deals. Head over any Friday night after 5 p.m. and get the full aquarium experience for half price. That’s right, bring along your Baltimore roommates and that’s a two-for-one special you can enjoy together. You can even make it a double date! The more the merrier, right? Additionally, if you’re bringing along miniature roommates, kids eat free Monday through Thursday at The Hard Rock Cafe. Check out the <a href="https://aqua.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">aquarium’s website</a> for a number of year-round discounts including military, parking and other promotions.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">For the food loving Baltimore roommates</h3>



<p>If you’re a foodie (especially a seafood lover), you’ve picked one of the coolest cities to settle — and dig — into. Baltimore Ravens Defensive Back Nick Perry says that eating is for sure one of his favorite things to do in Charm City, and there’s rarely a dull moment for Baltimore roommates. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“There’s always something to do. Baltimore is known for its seafood. Their crab cakes are out of this world!” he tells us.</p></blockquote>



<p>Surprised? Don’t be. Baltimore’s foodie reputation is often overlooked. In fact, Thrillist named it one of the seven most <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/where-to-eat-in-america-the-7-most-underrated-american-food-cities-in-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underrated American food cities</a> in 2015, saying Baltimore is a kind of “petri-dish” left to its own instrument. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“It sits there just out of the spotlight until you take off the lid and realize all of the crazy stuff happening inside. The art, music, and food scenes are filled with thriving communities that not only don’t frown on experimentation, but expect it,” Dan Gentile, the article’s author, writes.</p></blockquote>



<p>Even better? There’s a plethora of farms within a 15-minute drive of downtown. And weekly farmer’s markets to assist the farm-to-table advocates and&nbsp;vegan Baltimore roommates in stocking the fridge.</p>
