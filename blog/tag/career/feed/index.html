										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Think of your brain like an old Windows desktop (probably the first system that introduced you to the beautiful world of the internet.) Now think about how you thought of multitasking and opened a couple of tabs, only to stare at that buffering circle on your screen. Even though preemptive multitasking was one of the core features of Microsoft (more on that later.)</p>



<p>And arguably, it still happens to most of us. However advanced our computers might get, when we open a plethora of tabs on our browser, we face the inevitable buffer.</p>



<p>Exception: David Roberts from Vox who opened <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/1/8695555/browser-tabs" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">277 tabs on his browser</a> without any difficulty using some nerdy browser hacks!</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the catch. Computers were built by looking at the neural networks of our brain. So there&#8217;s bound to be similarities. And unfortunately, the computers we&#8217;ve built have long surpassed our meagre human brain abilities. This means our brains need to put even more effort when we want to practice multitasking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What happens in the brain when we&#8217;re multitasking</h2>



<p>Even advanced high-tech computers slow down when they&#8217;re multitasking in the form of 10s of 100s of open browsers. So what do you think happens in our brain when we try and open multiple tabs &#8211; to carry out many tasks all at the same time?</p>



<p>Think how when you&#8217;re cooking and someone&#8217;s talking in your ear, physically or through the phone. It increases the risk of messing things up, even if you&#8217;re a pro at cooking or talking on the phone.</p>



<p>Or think about when you&#8217;re working and your favorite song comes on. You feel the urge to sing along. And even though listening and singing along is enjoyable to us, it becomes a task for the brain. And inevitably, your other task &#8211; work takes a hit.</p>



<p>To find the science behind this fascinating process of multitasking and what happens in the brain, Eyal Ophir and his colleagues at Stanford wanted to find out <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/august24/multitask-research-study-082409.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what happens in the brain of multitaskers</a> &#8211; or people who swear by multitasking.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s what the researchers found</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>They (the multitaskers) couldn&#8217;t help thinking about the task they weren&#8217;t doing. The high multitaskers are always drawing from all the information in front of them. They can&#8217;t keep things separate in their minds.</em></p><cite>Eyal Ophir, Stanford</cite></blockquote></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are multitasking skills? Do they exist?</h2>



<p>Well, it all depends on what you want out of your time. Ask yourself what you are trying to achieve by multitasking.</p>



<p>Say you work two jobs. One full-time, and the other &#8211; <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/all-you-need-to-know-about-finding-online-jobs-and-freelancing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelancing on the side</a>. Would it help if you just opened both in two separate tabs and worked on them simultaneously? For obvious reasons, both tasks would clash with each other when you navigate through. And switching tabs on a whim is just not an option.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can we practice it at all, then?</h3>



<p>If you do have to put multitasking skills into place &#8211; still taking the example of two jobs, you need to be smart about it. If your brain can take only one thing at a time to be efficient and quick, you need to put your priorities in place.</p>



<p>So, focus on one particular goal, and set a timeline for it. Stay away from your distracting phone. You could even shut the music off, or put something calm that will help you stay focused. And then just carry out the said task to completion.</p>



<p><strong>Then,</strong> move on to the other task after a short break.</p>



<p>That is simply your best chance at multitasking, however many tasks you want to finish.</p>



<p>If you focus on efficiency on one task at a time, to your surprise, you&#8217;ll find you have more and more time if you shoo the distractions away!</p>



<p>And that is what pre emptive multitasking is too &#8211; in computers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is preemptive multitasking? What can we learn from that?</h2>



<p><strong><em>In technical terms, preemptive multitasking is when a computer operating system uses some criteria to decide how long to allocate to any one task before giving another task a turn to use the operating system.</em></strong></p>



<p>So basically, do just that. Use the software (brain) that you have with as much efficiency as you can, by understanding it better and giving it what it needs, so it can give you what you need.</p>



<p>To put it simply, allocate time to one task, before giving another task a go.</p>



<p>So no matter what tasks you&#8217;re trying to complete, divide your day into the tasks you want to finish and how long each task might take. In the way of preemptive multitasking, start one thing and take it to completion, without switching to other things. And before you know it, you&#8217;ll have shut your desktop and have plenty of time to unwind after work, every day!</p>

<p>Are you stuck in a career that you detest? Perhaps in a job that makes you doubt yourself? Maybe you catch yourself daydreaming about the life you envisioned yourself living when you were a student. Or maybe you&#8217;re just exhausted with the corporate rut of rinse and repeat. What you truly seek is a purpose and a life full of adventure. You want to grow professionally and seize opportunities. But you&#8217;re <em>not sure if you have it in you.</em> Well, the good news is that you are never too old or too late to turn your dreams into reality. Especially when it comes to your career, you can always grow by setting a professional development plan for yourself. Keep reading to find out what that is!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is professional growth?</h2>



<p>Professional growth or professional development essentially refers to learning new skills that make you better in your career. It keeps you from going obsolete in an ever-evolving job market. A professional development plan lets you outline the skills you need to excel in your career, stay up-to-date with trends, and carve an individualistic presence for yourself in your industry.</p>

This could happen to anyone, whether they’re involved in online jobs or otherwise. These are valid feelings, acknowledge them and then <em>look toward what you can do about it.</em></p>

<p>Unable to identify a fulfilling career? Explore your feelings to understand exactly why. Sometimes the answer is easy. It could be because you dislike your boss or the work itself. Maybe it’s about being in front of a computer all day or the uncertainty attached to your job. Perhaps, you don’t really see your career panning out as you previously imagined.</p>



<p>Other times, the answer is wrapped up in feelings and reasons. Do you not get the sense of purpose that you crave? Do you need to do more meaningful work?</p>



<p>Sometimes the effects of your job are detrimental. For example, online jobs force you to stare at a screen for hours on end. If this brings up health issues, it can be harmful. Commit to doing self-work and find out exactly which aspects of your job that you do not like.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Understanding <strong><em>what you do not like</em></strong> is half the answer. Once you know what you don’t like, you can figure out what you <strong><em>do</em></strong> like.</p>

<p>This step may be slower, but we really hope you stick with it. Figure out a routine that allows you to experiment outside of work hours. You can explore avenues you are interested in by building your skills in those areas and gathering experience in those fields.</p>



<p>Be patient, intentional, and mindful as you go through this phase. Reap the rewards when you finally find a purpose that fits your needs.</p>



<p>This may not play out how you think it’s going to be. Life has a way of surprising us. For those who feel unfinished satisfaction within current roles, one worthwhile exploration is into fields where skills directly translate to a meaningful career. Consider vocational education which concretely equips individuals with the skills needed for specific trades. Taking time to explore such opportunities allows you to <a href="https://www.miller-motte.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find the right career path</a> that offers fulfillment synonymous with accomplishment and passion. Also, know that it’s completely normal to have loved your career up to now but suddenly find that it’s lost its spark.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Remember to have realistic goals. Whether it’s online jobs or otherwise, you are going to have a few bad days and a few boring ones. The key is to look for a career that has you feeling fulfilled and purposeful.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The good news is that today there are different kinds of roles that were not around a few years ago. You can find online jobs that let you work from home or those that involve being out in the field. All you have to do is figure out which one you can see yourself looking forward to doing. And you can find a job like that near you.</p>

<p>However long it takes, don’t give up on finding your purpose. Remember that you’re doing this for <em>yourself</em>. Once you find your purpose, chart out a transition plan to safely move on to the next chapter in your life. It can be a little nerve-wracking to get out of your comfort zone so have a solid backup plan.</p>



<p>We’ve simplified these steps to fit into this blog. Know that there is no set formula for life and a career. Sometimes, we’re all at sea. All we can do is our best and have faith that things will work out, sometimes in the strangest ways. Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the transition into remote working in 2020, all of our careers felt a jolt. It&#8217;s taken us some time but we are all finding ourselves slowly adjusting to this new work structure. Some of us may have also readjusted our career timelines. And for many of us, professional development can be seen as the need of the hour.</p>



<p>Think of professional development as a fitness plan, but for your career. The path you choose or its intensity are two completely subjective factors.</p>



<p>Here are some important questions you can ask yourselves before you start addressing what professional development should look like in 2021:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>How much time can you devote to your professional development?</li><li>In what amount of time would you wish to see results?</li><li>Are you seeking improvement within your current job or are you looking to broaden your career horizons?</li></ul>



<p>Before moving ahead, we would like to mention that professional development is an ongoing process. It&#8217;s something that people choose to work on actively and over time — as they set new goals every day.</p>



<p>The following methods should only be taken as general advice. It&#8217;s also important to mention, this, by no means, is an exhaustive list. And no one needs to keep doing these things every single day for <strong>professional development</strong>.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, professional development is a part of an individual&#8217;s journey towards self-improvement. And everybody&#8217;s journey is different.</p>



<p>Having said that, let&#8217;s look at some of the best ways to improve yourself professionally, in 2021!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep making new connections!</h2>

<p>This had to be our first piece of advice for 2021. Some people swear by statements like, &#8220;Nothing helps more than knowing the right people at the right time.&#8221; And we&#8217;re one of them.</p>



<p>Networking is a tried and tested way to progress along your career path. It could be networking in the form of finding a mentor, who helps you when you need it the most. Or in the form of finding new opportunities, gaining insight into the kind of training you desire.</p>



<p>This also means that we need to recognize that every person you come across adds value to your life &#8211; professionally and personally! We come across people who inspire our work ethic every day. And we come across people that reignite motivation every day. The key is to be confident and bold. And keeping your radar wide open for people from all walks of life.</p>

<p>Active learning is one of the best ways to reach your goals, especially in 2021. Finding yourself a mentor is seeking knowledge from somebody who has walked the career path you want to be on.</p>



<p>And as a mentee, you don&#8217;t just get to learn from your mentor&#8217;s past experiences. You also avoid the mistakes that they have made, and build motivation and momentum to reach your goals.</p>

<p>Any sort of personal or professional growth is about managing time. But time management does not only mean doing more with the time you already have on your hands. It&#8217;s about knowing there is a limit on how much you can accomplish in a day.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how motivated and productive you might be. You only have 24 hours in a day, and along with work, you need to eat, sleep and relax too!</p>



<p>So good time management means making the most of the first minute of your day, as well as the last.</p>



<p>Improving your schedule, however, wouldn&#8217;t just add to your professional growth. It would mean resetting things in your life as a whole. Routines and schedules are important for human beings to function. And time is a deadly and limited resource.</p>

<p>Before we started writing this, we were convinced we&#8217;d only need to talk about soft-skills like communication. But we were quite wrong, as you may have already noticed.</p>



<p>However, soft-skills are still a very integral part of professional growth. Soft skills can include any skill you could take to a job outside of your current industry, and anything that makes you a better part of a team. Some of the most basic soft skills include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Communication of all forms — written &amp; spoken.</li><li>Transferable skills such as — leadership &amp; research</li><li>Being able to recount and apply what you have learned from your past mistakes.</li><li>Interpersonal skills — the way you talk with your coworkers, and work on the weaknesses you may have.</li></ul>



<p>These are some of the easiest things individuals can work on to progress towards being a better professional.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t just mean adding more books to your Amazon wish list. Neither do we mean add magazine subscriptions that you never ever open. A lot of the advice we have given today requires active effort.</p>



<p>Books are a great way to learn from other people&#8217;s experiences. There is no doubt about that. They have also become greatly accessible with the advent of e-books and PDFs and websites like <a href="https://libgen.is" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Libgen</a> (try out their extensive library — it&#8217;s crazy!)</p>



<p>But some exciting ways to access professional development through books include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Introducing yourself to genres you&#8217;ve never tried before.</li><li>Reading books, papers and magazine interviews by pioneers in your industry, or people who are doing what you wish to do.</li><li>Thrift for books and sign up for forums that discuss books!</li></ul>



<p>We could have also added self-help books to this list. Or those books that teach you how to avoid procrastination (Roomi&#8217;s suggestion: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95887.Eat_That_Frog_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eat That Frog! — A book by Brian Tracy</a> that helps you get more done in less time).</p>

<p>Professional growth is driven by the goals that we set. The best way to work with goals is to set different durations to the goals you wish to work towards. Identify not only where you want to go, but also how you wish to get there.</p>



<p>You can set short-term, medium-term, long-term goals – ranging from quick wins that might take a little effort to achieve, to ambitious goals that you dedicate years to.</p>

<p>When toxic self-doubt makes itself at home in your head, it can become difficult to think straight. Talk to a trusted friend, mentor, family member, or even a mental health professional to help give you the perspective you need on your career and life.</p>



<p>Expressing troublesome thoughts dims their power and gives you a sense of relief. You can also use the newly-gained perspective to chart out an action plan.</p>

<p>A quarter-life crisis often stems from the feeling of ‘is this all I’ll ever be?’ You may feel a bit boxed in by your own decisions. Try to pick up work outside your current career. Explore your other interests; Perhaps even look to add a second stream of income with freelance jobs.</p>



<p>This will give you a wider range to pursue something that you’re truly interested in and gives you a reason to wake up in the morning, adding joy to your day.</p>

<p>The people who hold the highest paying jobs are often not looking at money as the objective but focusing on the skill. This gives you purpose. Rather than competing in the rat race, you’re looking at developing something purer and more fulfilling.</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to branch away from the subject you majored in at college. If you’re nervous about making a drastic change: start slow by taking up freelance jobs to start with. A lot of careers today don’t follow traditional paths. Many have even thrived on a lifetime of freelance jobs, moving from one interesting project to another.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>Nothing will ruin your 20s more than the thought that you should have your life together already.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>We are brought up with the idea that to work hard and achieve ‘the dream’, is the only way to be happy. In reality, success isn’t such a simplistic idea. Everyone has a different definition of it. Take this time to understand what success truly means to you.</p>



<p>How is it related to your idea of happiness? What do you want your life to look like? What sort of days can you see yourself having? Start there. There is no wrong or right answer. This crisis is telling you that you need to focus on what <em>you</em> want.</p>

<p>If you’ve spent most of your life doing things that people want you to do, this part can be confusing. Look within yourself and notice the aspects of your life that you are resisting.</p>



<p>Marriage? Kids? A path that involves chasing after the highest paying jobs? Resistance is your friend once you understand <em>why</em> you’re resisting something. Poke at those feelings until they develop and reveal your purpose.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8216;Andragogy&#8217; a term originally coined by German educator Alexander Kapp and popularized by US educator Malcolm Knowles refers to adult learning. You might be wondering how it is any different from regular learning since children and adults both can potentially learn the same things.</p>



<p>While that is true, there are many factors that differentiate adult and child learning in the way of approach.</p>



<p>The number one differentiating factor is that as children, we HAVE to learn. We&#8217;re sent to learn in a formal setting and we have no pressure of earning a living to weigh us down.</p>



<p>And as children, the question of &#8216;what do you want to do in life?&#8217; doesn&#8217;t send us convulsing and wanting to hide undercover in bed muttering &#8216;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/tedtalks-when-you-dont-know-what-to-do-with-life-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">I don&#8217;t know what I want to do in life!</a>&#8216;</p>



<p>So for the next time you want to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/inspiring-quotes-to-help-you-learn-new-skills-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pick up a skill to learn</a>, take it easy and use the principles of adult learning to your benefit.</p>



<p>And no matter whether you want to take up formal learning at an adult learning center, or try your hand at independent self-learning using educational websites, these adult learning principles will motivate you to learn better!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Inculcate self-directed learning</h2>



<p>When we&#8217;re young, our learning can be motivated by a lot of external factors, such as grades, our parents, teachers, peers, and a sense of competition in class.</p>



<p>On the other hand, in the first principle of adult learning, Knowles states that <strong><em>as adults, we must WANT to learn and have a strong inner motivation to push ourselves to develop a new skill or learn something new.</em></strong></p>



<p>He also says we&#8217;re practical in our approach to learning. We can&#8217;t follow a curriculum that has subjects we might not be interested in or see no future prospect of helping us in our career or life.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596495717664-15c0aa11458c?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1050&amp;q=80" alt="Learn New Skills"/></figure>



<p>Simply speaking, external factors cease to affect us because we&#8217;re caught up in life, carrying out the responsibilities that come with being an adult.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s much to do anyway! It <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/turn-any-job-into-your-dream-job-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be a job</a> or getting a college degree, earning money, managing that money, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/renting-an-apartment-in-a-pandemic-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying rent</a>, doing chores, and of course, unwinding in front of the TV!</p>



<p>So if you&#8217;re looking to learn something new, make sure you&#8217;re really interested in it, and it has a very practical use in your career or life. Once you find the skill you want to learn, you could either find a good adult learning center or an educational website that helps you learn better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Practice, practice, practice, and also have some fun</h2>



<p>Another principle by Knowles states that <strong><em>adults learn by DOING, with active practice and participation.</em></strong></p>



<p>And while we&#8217;re practicing, Knowles also states that as adults, we learn best in informal situations, by taking the responsibility and the value that achieving desired goals will bring to our lives.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536158525388-65ad2110afc8?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1050&amp;q=80" alt="practice and participation"/></figure>



<p>So when taking up a new skill, try practicing it as much and as often you can. Find a good adult learning center or educational website that makes learning fun. Because if you have fun while doing it, chances are you will do it more than you anticipate, and get more motivation automatically!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Don&#8217;t let your prior knowledge come in the way</h2>



<p>As adult learners, the one thing we need to be wary of is thinking we know it all! And let&#8217;s face it, we fall victim to such thoughts more often than not.</p>



<p>But when you sit to learn a new skill, you need to have fresh eyes and assume you know absolutely nothing. <strong><em>A fresh mindset can help <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/bored-in-the-house-heres-a-new-perspective-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">look at old things with a newer perspective</a>, thus strengthening what we&#8217;ve already learned before.</em></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1491841550275-ad7854e35ca6?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=967&amp;q=80" alt="look at old things with a newer perspective"/></figure>



<p>Say you pick up learning a skill you might have learned as a child, but didn&#8217;t continue learning. So now when you pick it up again, don&#8217;t rush through the bits you might have learned before. Learn it as if you were learning it for the first time and it will do you more good now.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Find like-minded people</h2>



<p>Another one of Knowles adult learning principle states that <strong><em>being in an inviting, collaborative, and networking environment as an active participant in the learning process makes it efficient.</em></strong></p>



<p>And as children, we had our own imaginative world at our disposal to help with learning. Think back on the times you would make your stuffed toys sit in front of you and play pretend to be a teacher when learning something for school.</p>



<p>Doing that as an adult, well, is just not possible!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523240795612-9a054b0db644?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1050&amp;q=80" alt="Find like-minded people"/></figure>



<p>So the best thing to do would be to find classes, adult learning centers or educational websites that bring like minded people together to make your learning experience collaborative and fun!</p>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve read through these principles. Use them to help you level up your skillset, because the world is now yours to make!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new arena that might have opened up while you&#8217;re at home, is of upskilling and finding new skills to learn during quarantine. Whether you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-comedy-movies-to-watch-when-you-hate-your-job-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">hate your job</a> and want to find another way to earn a living, or just want to have more options in your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/its-okay-if-you-dont-have-a-surefire-career-plan-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">career plan</a> and your life, a sure way to do that is to try upskilling.</p>



<p>And with the world shutting us in, it&#8217;s now possible to invest time and find new skills to learn during quarantine, with the help of educational websites and resources on the internet!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong><em>As Ralph Waldo Emerson has said, “Bad times have a scientific value. These are occasions a good learner would not miss.”</em></strong></p></blockquote>



<p>So let&#8217;s get right to it and see some of the most useful new skills to learn during quarantine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. A new language</h2>



<p>This highly <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/380305/12-surprising-benefits-learning-new-language-that-youll-experience">beneficial skill</a> might not help you directly with your job search but it can make you a more confident and charismatic person. And this form of upskilling always works when you venture into the work world.</p>



<p>When you do try and learn a new language, you&#8217;re also connecting newer pathways for your brain that helps you understand the world better, making you use more <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/creative-things-self-isolation/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">creativity in work and in life</a>. And if you find good educational websites to help you learn this new skill during quarantine, it can open a lot of closed doors in your career too.</p>



<p>Another reason to add this to your list of new skills to learn during quarantine is that it will be a very fun and entertaining learning experience when you get to it. Think of all the foreign movies you can watch while pretending to understand what they&#8217;re saying without reading the subtitles!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Personal finance</h2>



<p>When you enter the world of work, the one thing you need to set straight in your life is MONEY. Because once you start earning money, learning <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/the-importance-of-personal-finance-management-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to manage it</a> is crucial. So if you add this to your list of new skills to learn during quarantine, it might take you places your job or college degree won&#8217;t.</p>



<p>And if personal finance is something that scares you, you don&#8217;t need to be intimidated by it anymore! There are a number of educational websites, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-books-to-help-you-manage-your-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">finance books</a> and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-best-personal-finance-blogs-to-manage-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">finance blogs</a> that can help you learn this super useful skill without putting in much effort.</p>



<p>And while you&#8217;re upskilling, take the help of educational websites to learn how to do your taxes because you&#8217;re an adult now &#8211; even if you don&#8217;t feel like one!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Effective communication</h2>



<p>This is one of the best new skills to learn during quarantine because of its practical use in your career. When you&#8217;re traversing the job world, you need to be able to communicate in a way that helps create more opportunities for you.</p>



<p>In this highly competitive world, it is tough to stand out, but you can create more space for you to do so by upskilling and learning the art of effective communication via plenty of educational websites on the internet. Add the skill of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolkinseygoman/2018/08/26/5-ways-body-language-impacts-leadership-results/?sh=f352a6e536af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading body language</a> to your list of new skills to learn during quarantine and you can make your interactions better and more useful in the long run.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Managing your self</h2>



<p>The world can change 10 times over and you will have no control over it. But what you can have control over is yourself. So one useful new skill to learn during quarantine would be the skill of bringing out the best in YOU in all circumstances.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/home-environment-and-healthy-living-habits-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exercising and meditating are skills that keep you healthy</a>, happy, and more energetic to take on the world, along with the power to adapt to new situations with a sense of calm and confidence. And we all need it more than ever right now.</p>



<p>Another reason to look at self-management as a new skill to learn during quarantine is that it will empower you with the organization and productivity skills you would need in order to be successful. Once you have these skills work as superpowers for you, you won&#8217;t be troubled by the pressures that the job world might create.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. DIY activities and hobbies</h2>



<p>A successful person isn&#8217;t someone who&#8217;s always working, but rather, is someone who is happy because they have a satisfying and meaningful life outside of work. So when you&#8217;re preparing for the job world while sitting at home, upskilling and getting a few hobbies and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-diy-hacks-to-make-your-weekend-great-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">DIY skills</a> up your sleeve is a guarantee for happiness, come what may.</p>



<p>This is a useful new skill to learn during quarantine because it can make you self sufficient, making your free time fun and relaxing, no matter how your job makes you feel.</p>



<p>NOW is the time. So go and learn something useful for yourself, by yourself!</p>



<p>And when you&#8217;re ready, let these <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/inspiring-quotes-to-help-you-learn-new-skills-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspiring quotes motivate you to learn new skills</a> during quarantine.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s January 2021. The days are short, dark and cold. You&#8217;d rather be sleeping in or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/7-motivational-movies-for-young-professionals-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">watching a motivational movie</a>, instead of motivating yourself to work from home. But whether it&#8217;s school assignments or the work emails that you&#8217;re ignoring, you know you would have to get to it eventually.</p>



<p>And after you&#8217;ve finally <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/convince-your-boss-to-let-you-work-remotely-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">convinced your boss to let you work remotely</a>, it might be even harder to convince YOURSELF to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/20-work-from-home-relatable-memes-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">work from home</a>. Trust us, we know!</p>



<p>So we thought we&#8217;d list down some of the ways we motivate ourselves to work from home, even when we don&#8217;t want to! Because let&#8217;s face it, the guilt of not working, clubbed with the anxiety of work piling up through the days is a tougher path to navigate than actually sitting down to work.</p>



<p>So push the quilts away, make a nice cuppa and get to work, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/health-wellness-tips-from-reddit-users-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you lazy bum</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Stop thinking about how much work you have</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s some advice for all the winter procrastinators in the work from home era &#8211; stop substituting any real work with to-do lists!</p>



<p>Shush that inner monologue that keeps yapping about how much work you have, how you&#8217;ll never get on with it, and the many time management skills you lack to make it happen. Trust that once you begin, the satisfaction of ticking things off your to do list on your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work desk</a> will make up for the time you spend away from your bed!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Baby steps; you&#8217;re a grown-up now</h2>



<p>You&#8217;re not a baby anymore. You sure wish you were, when everything was done for you, and people had to work for you instead of the other way around. But one thing that we can learn from our baby days is to take tiny, baby steps whenever we feel stuck in our adult lives.</p>



<p>Check your work from home to-do list for loopholes. Do you have ambiguous or long term tasks laid down in their entirety? If yes, break them down into doable baby-sized tasks.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Begin somewhere</h2>



<p>Another challenge of working from home and dreaming of conjuring up time management skills, instead of getting to work is that you still get no work done and waste so much time in the process.</p>



<p>So push thoughts like &#8216;omg when am I going to finish my work&#8217; away, and acknowledge the fact that there is no finish line, especially when you work from home!</p>



<p>So just start somewhere! Block an amount of time and start work on the task you would enjoy the most &#8211; or something that&#8217;s easy. Addict yourself to the ticks on your to-do list and you&#8217;ll be working through it like the total boss you are!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. But it&#8217;s so boring, and Netflix is asking me whether I&#8217;m still watching!</h2>



<p>Think about it this way &#8211; you&#8217;d never have anything to watch if people didn&#8217;t get up and get to their tasks with proper time management skills. Even in a seemingly exciting world of entertainment such as a Netflix job, there must be some very boring tasks that people needed to do to get that content out to you. So take inspiration from Netflix if that&#8217;s holding you back, and get to work!</p>



<p>If a job is extra boring and you just don&#8217;t want to do it, make it exciting for yourself! <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-tips-to-stop-hating-your-job-all-the-time-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop saying you hate your job</a> and focus your energy on the positive aspects &#8211; like working in your PJs!</p>



<p>Take advantage of the work from home lifestyle, put on some good <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13JaEgvqDn2i1B4M5JzkJZ?si=FNrft5AJRV-GG-8JigATFQ" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">music you can head bang to</a>, and get clicking or typing. The one good thing at the end of all of this is &#8211; you can get back to Netflix right after!</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:83%">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Think about the rewards!</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of making lists like we are, here&#8217;s something you might like to do when you work from home:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><em>Make a solid time management schedule.</em></li><li>M<em>ake a list of the number of reasons why you need to get the task at hand done.</em></li><li>P<em>roceed to list down how you&#8217;ll feel when you&#8217;ve finally done it.</em></li><li>M<em>ake a list of the activities you can enjoy or the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-comedy-movies-to-watch-when-you-hate-your-job-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">movies you can watch</a> once you&#8217;ve done it.</em></li></ol>



<p>Be strict and don&#8217;t reward yourself until you complete what you have to. If there&#8217;s a lot to do and it will take weeks to finish, learn more about time management and make a plan that allows you small rewards for small tasks everyday and a BIG reward for when it&#8217;s finally all done.</p>

	</div>
	


<p>Now stop reading articles online already and start working!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>No matter how old we get, there&#8217;s a question that plagues most of us from time to time. And that is: &#8216;What should I do with my life?&#8217; More often than not, this contemplation makes us realize how difficult this conversation is with ourselves. So we give up thinking and comfortably resort back to living a mundane, routine life. And we accept the fact that having <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/its-okay-if-you-dont-have-a-surefire-career-plan-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a surefire career plan</a> is just not for us. <br>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way! Let inspiring TED talks come to the rescue. </p>



<p>So stop being &#8216;comfortably numb&#8217; while <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-tips-to-stop-hating-your-job-all-the-time-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">hating your job</a>. And watch 6 TED talks to find ways to answer the unavoidable &#8211; &#8216;What should I do with my life?&#8217;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <em>Why you will fail to have a great career</em> &#8211; Larry Smith, Professor of Economics at the University of Waterloo, Canada</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-ted wp-block-embed-ted wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Larry Smith: Why you will fail to have a great career" src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/larry_smith_why_you_will_fail_to_have_a_great_career" sandbox="allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin" width="1250" height="704" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Don&#8217;t let the title of this TED talk misguide you! Professor Larry Smith entices us to stop making excuses when it comes to finding a job we&#8217;re passionate about. So he says that our problem is that we think people who find their calling are special, and we&#8217;re not like them.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s a solution to this problem. Get up and finally take the action required for passion to lead the way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>I&#8217;m not quite sure why you decide not to do it. You&#8217;re too lazy to do it. It&#8217;s too hard. You&#8217;re afraid if you look for your passion and don&#8217;t find it, you&#8217;ll feel like you&#8217;re an idiot</em>.<em> </em>S<em>o then you make excuses about why you&#8217;re not going to look for your passion. They are excuses, ladies and gentlemen. We&#8217;re going to go through a whole long list</em>!</p><cite>Larry Smith </cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong><em>Why some of us don&#8217;t have one true calling</em></strong> &#8211; TED talk by Emilie Wapnick, career coach</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-ted wp-block-embed-ted wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Emilie Wapnick: Why some of us don&#039;t have one true calling" src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling" sandbox="allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin" width="1250" height="704" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Career coach Emilie Wapnick says it&#8217;s okay if you have multiple passions or interests you want to pursue. Even though Jack of all trades might be master of none. But at least Jack can be happy if he embraces his curiosity to pursue different things!</p>



<p>She celebrates the &#8216;multipotentialites&#8217; in this talk. Multipotentialities are those of us with many interests, many jobs over a lifetime and many interlocking potentials. She supports her argument with examples of people who have not been celebrated as much as the masters of one skill have been in our culture.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>The notion of the narrowly focused life&nbsp;is highly romanticized in our culture.&nbsp;It&#8217;s this idea of destiny or the one true calling</em>. <em>The idea that we each have one great thing&nbsp;we are meant to do during our time on this earth</em>. A<em>nd you need to figure out what that thing is&nbsp;and devote your life to it.&nbsp;But what if you&#8217;re someone who isn&#8217;t wired this way?&nbsp;What if there are a lot of different subjects that you&#8217;re curious about,&nbsp;and many different things you want to do?&nbsp;</em></p><cite>Emilie Wapnick</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong><em>The psychology of your future self</em></strong> &#8211; TED talk by Dan Gilbert, Harvard Psychologist</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-ted wp-block-embed-ted wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dan Gilbert: The psychology of your future self" src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_the_psychology_of_your_future_self" sandbox="allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin" width="1250" height="704" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Harvard psychologist Dan Gibert says our beliefs about the things that will make us happy are often wrong. And that&#8217;s backed up by research based evidence, of course! He says our progress and happiness is imperceivable because change is inevitable.</p>



<p>In conclusion, time changes, we change, and our preferences change as well. So it&#8217;s okay if you don&#8217;t know what to do with your life yet. Put your trust in the only constant &#8211; that is change!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they&#8217;re finished. The person you are right now is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you&#8217;ve ever been. The one constant in our life is change.</em></p><cite>Dan Gilbert</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong><em>How to make hard choices</em></strong> &#8211; TED talk by Ruth Chang, Philosopher</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-ted wp-block-embed-ted wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ruth Chang: How to make hard choices" src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/ruth_chang_how_to_make_hard_choices" sandbox="allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin" width="1250" height="704" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Philosopher Ruth Chang asks us what makes hard choices so &#8230;. hard. She offers a new way to think about hard choices. Therefore, an easy way to come to a decision we can feel sure about.</p>



<p>It all comes down to how we perceive the hard choices, and our decisions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>This response in hard choices is a rational response, but it&#8217;s not dictated by reasons given to us. Rather, it&#8217;s supported by reasons created by us. When we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that, we wholeheartedly become the people that we are. You might say that we become the authors of our own lives.</em></p><cite>Ruth Chang</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. <em>2 questions to uncover your passion and turn it into a career</em> &#8211; Noeline Kirabo, social entrepreneur</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-ted wp-block-embed-ted wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Noeline Kirabo: 2 questions to uncover your passion -- and turn it into a career" src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/noeline_kirabo_2_questions_to_uncover_your_passion_and_turn_it_into_a_career" sandbox="allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin" width="1250" height="704" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Social entrepreneur Noeline Kirabo self educated her way our of Africa&#8217;s slums. And now she gives back to her community by helping Uganda&#8217;s out-of-school youth to turn their passions into a career.</p>



<p>In this TED talk, she shares the two important questions that we need to ask ourselves to find our passion, and then make a living doing it!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Now, when we talk about passion, one of the most common questions that people ask is, &#8220;What is passion? How do I even find it?&#8221; And in the simplest definition, passion is a collection of your life experiences that give you the deepest sense of fulfillment. And to identify your passion, you need to look inward.</em></p><cite>Noeline Kirabo</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. <em>How to find work you love</em> &#8211; Scott Dinsmore, founder of the career and connection platform, Live Your Legend</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-ted wp-block-embed-ted wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Scott Dinsmore: How to find work you love" src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/scott_dinsmore_how_to_find_work_you_love" sandbox="allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin" width="1250" height="704" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Scott Dinsmore is the founder of <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://liveyourlegend.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Live Your Legend</a>. He quit a job that made him miserable. Then he spent the next four years wondering how to find work that was joyful and meaningful. If you relate to this ambition but don&#8217;t know what to do to pursue it, this TED talk is for you! Dinsmore tells us the simplest way to find out what matters to you &#8211; and then start doing it!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote is-style-default" style="border-color:#e22658"><blockquote><p><em>The first part of this three-step passionate work framework is becoming a self-expert and understanding yourself, because if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re looking for, you&#8217;re never going to find it. And the thing is that no one is going to do this for us. There&#8217;s no major in university on passion and purpose and career. I don&#8217;t know how that&#8217;s not a required double major, but don&#8217;t even get me started on that. I mean, you spend more time picking out a dorm room TV set than you do you picking your major and your area of study. But the point is, it&#8217;s on us to figure that out, and we need a framework, we need a way to navigate through this.</em></p><cite>Scott Dinsmore</cite></blockquote></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The common perception is that once college is over, you&#8217;ll be able to put everything that you learned into practice. In reality, it is the skills that you have acquired over time that help you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/advice-for-college-graduates-covid-19-edition-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">succeed at work</a>. Before a job interview, almost everyone is left wondering if they have the right soft skills that employers are looking for. When seen from the employer&#8217;s perspective, getting the right people means recruiting candidates with the right work values. Soft skills help you work more effectively in your chosen career. The following work values, though not taught, are fundamental for you to succeed. And, they are a sure-shot way to spice up your resume!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What do you mean by knowing soft skills?</h2>

<p>Soft skills are more social than technical and reflect a person’s work values. These include the ability to accept feedback, maintain organization, problem solve, and collaborate with others. Soft skills also give you that competitive edge, when being considered for a role.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?sd=4/10/2014&amp;id=pr817&amp;ed=12/31/2014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">CareerBuilder</a>&nbsp;reports that 77% of employers look for candidates possessing soft skills. You’ve probably noticed them popping up in job listings, paired alongside technical qualifications.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Teamwork &amp; Emotional Intelligence.</h3>



<p>Ever wonder why lecturers request students to team up with a group of their peers to work on a specific project together? Working in a team is one of the most important soft skills that employers look for. Being a team player is essential while also being able to delegate and take responsibility when required. It boils down to building a good working relationship that helps everyone achieve their business goals and objectives.</p>



<p>And one of the biggest drivers of teamwork today is a high level of emotional intelligence. Though still a new factor in the soft skills employers look for, emotional intelligence is an in-demand work value. It is generally defined as the awareness of your emotions and feelings and those of others while being able to use the awareness to guide decisions and interactions with others.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leadership &amp; Persuasiveness. </h3>



<p>When you start your career, you&#8217;re likely to get a job that isn&#8217;t in the upper hierarchy. Employers look for more experienced candidates for managerial roles. Still, displaying leadership qualities will put you in a good position to become a manager in the future. Leadership skills may not be expected from you if you&#8217;re just starting your career. However, you&#8217;ll probably still need to show that you can lead a group of people by delegating tasks, setting deadlines, and lead others by setting a good example.</p>



<p>Persuasiveness is one of the top soft skills employers are looking for today. Team members that are persuasive leaders use their flexibility to manage the tasks at hand to ensure their part of the project is finished on time. Persuasive peer leadership is an admirable <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/time-management-101-how-do-i-make-time-for-my-hobbies-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">soft skill employers</a> are looking for, as it ensures the success of their teams. Having leadership and persuasiveness is also a sure-shot way to make your resume stand out.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Confidence &amp; Communication</h3>



<p>Being confident in yourself, but not arrogant, is a delicate balance that is hard to achieve. At the workplace, your confidence shows your colleagues that you believe in yourself and them. Confidence also indicates that you can always count on each other when facing everyday problems. It boosts the team&#8217;s morale.</p>



<p>Your employer will be observing everything about the way you communicate &#8211; from the way you talk and respond to interview questions to the way you write your emails. Regardless of the role, employers seek work values that allow employees to get along with others and communicate well verbally and non-verbally. Clear communication is an unsaid expectation since communication plays a crucial role in addressing issues and handling challenging situations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Curiosity &amp; Problem Solving </h3>



<p>A creative problem solver is the mark of an independent employee. It&#8217;s so easy to write a letter of complaint to your boss about your colleagues missing deadlines or give a negative review of your manager just because they asked you to stay an hour extra after work. Creative problem solvers know that having a lateral mindset and a flexible approach plays a key role in coming up with an intelligent solution. Problems are inevitable in any organizational structure. </p>



<p>How you maneuver through them and manage them is what&#8217;s going to set you apart. To put this further into context, &#8220;life-long learner&#8221; is a desired skill used in many job postings. This refers to a person&#8217;s innate curiosity and desire to learn more, with the ability to apply what is learned at work. And, this is a highly desirable work value.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Motivation &amp; The <em>Big Picture</em></h3>



<p>Even if you and your team at work have all the necessary skills and talent to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/motivating-yourself-to-work-from-home-in-2021-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieve your goals</a>, if you don&#8217;t have the motivation, you&#8217;re unlikely to reach your true potential. Motivated people have a positive approach and find meaning and value in the work they do every day. Employers look for motivated people to hire since their excitement can be infectious and, in turn, leads the team in a positive direction.</p>



<p>It is also highly desirable to be able to conceptualize what organizations are doing. And how they are affected by certain circumstances or decisions. Employers are looking for people who can work towards the larger goals of a company, and make decisions that will have results focused on larger company goals.</p>
