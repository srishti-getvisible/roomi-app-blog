<p>Though horse racing is one of the many things Louisville famous for, there are many more artisans. Head over to The Speed Art Museum, where you&#8217;ll see a special exhibit that includes works by Rembrandt. At Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft, you will find wonderful exhibits, such as innovative woodwork and textile creations, but you&#8217;ll also discover terrific gift items by 200 different artists. More art and shopping await at Glassworks, where you can watch the glassblowers at work and then buy a finished piece. How cool!</p>
