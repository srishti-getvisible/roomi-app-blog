<p>Living with a roommate isn&#8217;t always sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes it&#8217;s not possible to get along with everyone &#8211; especially when it comes to dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. When a roommate doesn&#8217;t pay their dues or leaves coffee mugs in the living room <em>every single day</em>, it may be time to evict your roommate. Basically, the bottom line is that you deserve to feel comfortable and at peace in your own home.</p>



<p>Evicting a roommate can be a touchy subject, especially if you&#8217;re someone who would rather avoid confrontation. But there&#8217;s nothing to worry about &#8211; we&#8217;re here to help you navigate through this ordeal so you know what you should and shouldn&#8217;t do when it comes to evicting your roommate.</p>



<p>Before making any rash decisions, we recommend you familiarize yourself with your state&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rentecdirect.com/blog/10-landlord-tenant-laws-to-remember/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tenant’s rights</a>. Many states dictate that even if your roommate does not have their name on the lease, they&#8217;re eligible to stay. If you’re both co-tenants, your roommates’ violations of your apartment lease might also put you at risk of being evicted. Once you gain clarity on your rights as a renter, you can make more empowered decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. When should you evict your roommate?</h2>



<p>Evicting someone from their home was never going to be easy. But no one wants to put up with a roommate who’s become a problem either. Knowing when to evict your roommate depends on how uncomfortable you and others in the house are. If your roommate is stealing from you, compromising your security, or bringing in people that have long <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/dealing-with-a-friend-who-overstayed-welcome-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overstayed their welcome</a>, then it’s time to make a quick decision and just evict your roommate.</p>



<p>Maybe the reason for your anger with your roommate is something that they can change or work on. Try having a genuine conversation about the issue you&#8217;re facing.  In case this does not bring in results, take it as a sign and move forward with your eviction plan.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Gather evidence to evict your roommate properly</h2>



<p>Gathering evidence to evict your roommate does sound very Sherlock Holmes. But trust us, you&#8217;re going to need it to build your case. Evidence is simply proof that will make your case stronger, especially if they are doing something illegal or dangerous. So, gather any evidence that backs up your claim eg. take pictures of damage caused in the apartment or the pets that are not allowed in your rental home. Save the rent receipts if your roommate has failed to pay rent or share utilities. Be careful not to violate the privacy of your roommate while gathering evidence.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Prepare for that conversation</h2>



<p>Is it normal to dread this conversation with your roommate? Yes. This conversation is something you probably need to think about and prepare for in advance. It&#8217;s best to go into it with a calm mind. Knowing how to evict your roommate will be a learning experience and hopefully it&#8217;ll deliver the outcome you need.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-giphy wp-block-embed-giphy"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="media-wrapper"><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/raydonovan-season-6-episode-10-ray-donovan-57UyhoLuq6n81uiHkt"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/media1.giphy.com/media/57UyhoLuq6n81uiHkt/giphy.gif?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Lets Talk Showtime GIF by Ray Donovan - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY" width="600" height="600" /></a></div>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Finally, tell them they need to move out</h2>



<p>As you prepare yourself to have this conversation, it&#8217;s important to know that the way you present your case will determine how your roommate feels about the entire situation. For example, you don’t have to tell your roommate you don’t want to live with them. Instead, you could say that you want to try living alone or someone else who is close to you is moving in with you.</p>



<p>Basically, you don&#8217;t have to disclose the specifics of why you want them to move out; you can be as diplomatic as possible. Try to keep blame and pent-up anger far away, and you should be mild in your approach and tell them that maybe this is not a good fit, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re not a good person.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Living in close proximity with someone means it’s natural to bump heads from time-to-time. Especially if you&#8217;re sharing a tiny NYC apartment. But in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, tensions can get even higher. You may be at a point where you feel like you&#8217;ve tried everything. Maybe you&#8217;re considering <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-tell-roommates-moving-out/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">telling your roommate you’re moving out</a>. Or maybe things are so bad that you think you need to evict your roommate. Roommate agreement be damned!</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, being able to finally cut ties can come as a huge relief. But before you get ahead of yourself, have you looked into legal (and moral) recommendations? Here’s what you need to know about evicting a roommate in NYC while the city battles coronavirus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do the NYC moratorium on evictions apply to you?</h2>



<p>Most of us have spent 2020 figuring out the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/can-i-leave-house-nyc-lockdown/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockdown rules in NYC</a> put in place because of COVID-19. If you&#8217;ve wanted to evict your roommate for a while, you’re already aware of the city’s moratorium on evictions. If you&#8217;re not, don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll give you a brief rundown. It&#8217;s basically a movement that prevents landlords from evicting tenants in both residential and commercial properties. And it has been extended until August 20th 2020. </p>

<p>The measure was put in place to support renters experiencing financial hardship as a result of COVID-19.  It&#8217;s a way to make sure renters don&#8217;t end up being homeless if they can’t afford to pay rent right now.</p>



<p>But, if you’re not a landlord and are just sharing a property with another roommate in NYC, does this no-eviction rule apply to you?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can leaseholders evict roommates?</h2>



<p>The current circumstances are uncertain for everyone. With new laws governing the rental market in all areas, both tenants and landlords are unsure about their rights. For that reason, we recommend reaching out to your building’s tenant association or a lawyer if you want to evict your roommate.</p>



<p>Remember that the person on the lease is the one with the rights, so if you’re both listed, you might have to battle it out and come to an agreement on who will be the one to leave. If you’re the one on the lease, you might be able to evict your roommate with ease- but again, check this with another source. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="http://www.metcouncilonhousing.org/help-answers/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metropolitan Council on Housing</a>, you have to have a good reason to evict your roommate. You can&#8217;t evict them if-</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li> They’ve lived in the apartment for 30 days or more and have paid you rent.</li><li>If you have a written roommate agreement with them that includes the length of time they’ll live with you.</li></ul>



<p> An exception can be made if they&#8217;ve breached the rules of the roommate agreement. Or if you can prove they&#8217;ve turned into a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-crazy-roommate/">crazy roommate</a> that you just can’t be around.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Before you evict your roommate, explore other options</h2>



<p>During this weird, stressful time, tensions can run high &#8211; we get it. If you can, try to talk things out with your roommate and see if you can cut each other some slack. Don&#8217;t try to evict your roommate right off the bat. </p>

<p>We can think of <em>so </em>many reasons to avoid evicting someone right now:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>It’s a scary world out there at the moment. Evicting your roommate might put them in a very stressful situation. Searching for a new apartment right now has the added stress meeting people that could have come into contact COVID-19.</li><li>If you’re the leaseholder, paying the rent is your responsibility. Could you afford to cover the rent of another person if they were to move out?</li><li>The city’s housing courts are currently only open for essential services. So, you’d have to wait if you need to resort to legal eviction proceedings.</li></ul>

<p>Trying to evict your roommate should be your final option. It can be very unethical to put someone in a situation where can&#8217;t practice social distancing. And it&#8217;s impossible to find a new apartment without comin into contact with other people. NYC already has the most cases of homelessness out of any city in the US. You should try your best to not put another person the position of being homeless in the middle of COVID-19. Instead, try talking out your problems. Recognize that your relationship with your roommate are probably worse because of the intensity of lockdown. But if there&#8217;s no other option but to evict your roommate, give them sufficient notice.</p>
