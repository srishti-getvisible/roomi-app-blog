<p>Roomi also conducts background checks and ID verification to avoid fraud and scams. Plus, in-app messaging to ensure that the conversations you&#8217;re having are safe and secure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-look-for-roommates-through-facebook-or-craigslist">2. Look for roommates through Facebook or Craigslist</h3>



<p>Before roommate finder apps and websites existed, Facebook, Craigslist, and even Reddit were the go-to platforms. It&#8217;s a bit old school as numerous people just post statuses that say: <em>&#8216;looking for roommates!&#8217;</em> and hope that someone they&#8217;ll eventually get along with answers.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it&#8217;s still effective, but you have to take precautions as there are a lot of scammers and fake profiles that can trick you if you&#8217;re not careful. To avoid this, be specific with your listing, and once you&#8217;re talking to a potential roomie, call them through video call (to ensure they&#8217;re actually the one in the profile!).</p>

<p>Roommate flyers may seem old-fashioned, but it&#8217;s never out of style. Sticking roommate flyers or posters on public bulletin boards, residence halls, lamp posts, walls, etc., is still as effective as posting a listing online. Just make sure that you have permission to stick your flyer in different places. </p>



<p>Roomi Tip: Be specific about the roommate that you&#8217;re looking for in your flyer. List down the specific qualities you&#8217;re looking for and the dealbreakers. This way, people will know if they fit the criteria or not.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-ask-friends-and-family">4. Ask friends and family</h3>



<p>A roommate doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be a stranger. You can ask family members and close friends if you have any around the area to be your roommate. Having a roommate who you already know and trust makes the prospect of living together more enjoyable.</p>



<p>However, some also advise against living with a close friend or relative as arguments or misunderstandings may happen. There may be disagreements that can become too personal and lead to a broken relationship. Still, all these can be avoided with proper communication.</p>



<p>If not friends and family themselves, maybe they know someone who&#8217;s also looking for a roommate and they can refer you. New York&#8217;s a big city with over 19 million people living in the city, it&#8217;s impossible that you wouldn&#8217;t be able to find a roommate!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-go-to-mixers-and-meetups-and-network-with-potential-roommates">5. Go to Mixers and Meetups and network with potential roommates</h3>



<p>Mixers and meetups in New York are common: it happens almost every week with different groups all around the city. Specifically, there are meetup events and roommate mixers hosted by local community organizations, apartment complexes, or social networking groups that you can attend.</p>



<p>This way, you get to meet your potential roommates in person, talk to them, get a feel of their vibe, and see if you&#8217;ll get along well. More than that, these events are a sure way of avoiding scammers and fake online profiles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-hard-is-it-to-find-a-roommate-in-nyc-well">How Hard Is It to Find a Roommate in NYC? Well&#8230;</h2>



<p>Finding a roommate in NYC may seem like a daunting task, but it&#8217;s definitely achievable. With a positive attitude, thorough research, and a bit of patience, you can find the perfect roommate to share your NYC adventure with.</p>



<p>Attend local events, utilize online platforms, and network with friends and colleagues to increase your chances of finding a compatible roommate.

<p>You never really expect to find yourself stuck outside your room at 1:00 a.m. while your roommate and their significant other &#8220;study&#8221; in your dorm room. Then again, you never really expect what college life throws at you. Many students prefer living on campus, while others are looking at apartments and housing elsewhere. No matter where you choose to live, this blog is our guide on some of the things to consider when choosing a roommate.</p>



<p>People will often tell you that living with somebody is a great way to cut costs and meet new people. But what nobody admits is that living with people you&#8217;ve never met before can be a pretty frightening experience and that not everyone is familiar with <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommate-etiquette-guidelines/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate etiquette</a>. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to ask yourself certain questions before you look at things to consider when choosing a roommate. How outgoing are you? Are you willing to share your stuff? What is the balance you&#8217;d want to keep between partying and studying? What kind of relationship do you want with your roommate?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s essential to keep these things in mind because you will encounter people with several different types of personalities throughout life. Different characters and values can often be the source of conflict in interpersonal relationships. If you look forward to establishing a lifelong friendship but are greeted with your roommate&#8217;s cold shoulder, problems could arise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cleanliness should mean the same thing to you and the person that you choose as your roommate.</h2>

<p>The first thing you need to discuss is cleanliness. This is important because you want your potential roommates to have the same basic cleaning habits as you. No one wants to wake up in the middle of the night, searching for the faint smell of rotten potatoes that interrupt your sleep, only to find out it&#8217;s coming from the body of the person you share a room with, yuck! </p>



<p>But it&#8217;s often so that two people living together find out over time that cleanliness as a concept is different for the two of them. One might be an overachiever when it comes to cleaning. And the other, a sucker for the bare minimum. In times like such, we recommend having a talk with your roommate. Or even drawing up a roommate agreement! Those come in super handy!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Habits should also align when choosing a roommate. </h2>

<p>A person&#8217;s habits are another thing you need to consider when choosing a roommate. Sleep schedules, smoking habits, vaping, or DJ-ing late at night. Whether you will have friends over, and what temperature you prefer your room to be. Sit and reflect on some of these questions. <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/uncategorized/how-to-live-with-the-opposite-sex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">It&#8217;s important to find roommates that have a similar lifestyle and habits to yourself.</a></p>



<p>Feel free to ask your potential roommate questions about how they like to live daily life. Do they like unwinding with a beer and an episode of Friends like you do? Do they like talking on the phone loudly or walking around the room naked? Anything can be a source of conflict, so don&#8217;t forget to discuss unusual habits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Relationship status can also impact roommate relationships.</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s not wrong to ask your potential roommate about their relationship status as well as the likeliness of an overnight guest since you don&#8217;t want your roommate&#8217;s partner invading your space too often. The idea here is for you to be informed about these things beforehand so that you are not caught by surprise after meeting someone new in the morning tossing up pancakes in your kitchen.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s important is that you and your roommate both <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/ways-to-make-a-new-roommate-feel-welcome-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">feel comfortable in your own homes</a>.  And that you&#8217;re able to openly discuss the conversation of partners and one night stands.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It will come down to your personal life vs. your roommate&#8217;s personal life.</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s said that politics and religion don&#8217;t make for polite conversation. However, experienced adults will tell you, when it comes to living with someone new, it&#8217;s time to stop being polite and start getting real. It is important to discuss these issues with potential roommates. </p>



<p>This is definitely one of the things to consider when choosing a roommate. You want your roommates to be open and accepting of your beliefs, even if they don&#8217;t align with theirs.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-personalities-youll-experience-in-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Your first experience living with new people can be challenging but fun.</a> Because who else, if not for our roommates, would go with us for fast food runs in the middle of the night? Who else would share their last bowl of ramen and cheer us up after a long day? If you are lucky, you might build lifelong friendships with the people you&#8217;ve lived with. And if you&#8217;re not, remember every situation comes to an end, and at least you&#8217;ll collect good stories from this experience.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affording an apartment in any city on your own may seem quite challenging. In such a case, you simply need to consider moving in with a roommate or roommates who will help you with paying the rent. This is a smart way that many people use to subsidize the cost of living in the fast paced and expensive cities. Sharing financial responsibility with roommates would greatly help cut down your expenses thus providing relief that you need the most to live comfortably.</span> But living with a random roommate also means problems will arise sooner or later.</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to find the right roommate, you need to take your time to search for a perfect match of what exactly you want by <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/roommates-requiring-id-verification-background-checks-at-all-time-high/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewing</a></span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">several potential roommates before moving in together to determine whether the arrangement would work. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet has become the most ideal place to find numerous roommates who also have the intention to share financial responsibilities with like-minded individuals so as to afford the lucrative apartments in the city. <a href="https://roomiapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roomi app</a> is an example of such apps that has helped many people in finding compatible roommates they live to live with. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the question many people ask is what the ideal number of roommates is. While some prefer one, others prefer two or even more. Here some advantages and draw backs of having one, two or three roommates.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>One roommate</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, living with one roommate, it may seem like prime real estate. Because you will be dealing with an individual whom you think shares the same interests as yours, it seems there won&#8217;t be a problem. Until you have your first disagreement. Living with a single roommate is all fun, until the problems start rolling in. Yes, if you agree in a number of things it might be easier. However, this arrangement has its setbacks as well. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is good that you will talk over issues and agree on the modality of stay but you must watch out for that idiot roommate who will otherwise ruin your bachelor/bachelorette life. Just think of a time when your only roommate is out; who will be your pregame buddy? Or what if that single roommate is a jerk, whom will you lean on?</span></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Two roommates</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two roommates sound as good idea since you will have someone to talk to when you have issues with the other. Besides, it is good to have a roommate that will help break the silence between the two of you that have fallen out with each other. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with this kind of arrangement is realized when you need to exercise more power and authority on the two who might like each other more than they like you- many people have this kind of insecurity. When the arrangement is organized properly based on certain agreements then it is bound to go really well with you. You only need to work your way out to establish dominance from the onset of the arrangement.</span> Make sure <span style="font-weight: 400;">that both of them like and want to hang out with you more. Don’t allow the other two roommates to become besties leaving you out. </span>B<span style="font-weight: 400;">ecause sooner, they will start <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/coliving-101-help-my-roommate-talks-behind-my-back-roomi/">talking shit</a> about you.</span></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Three roommates</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to many people, this is the best arrangement because there is always middle ground. While two may decide to become quite close leaving you out, you will have one to lean on. Life becomes hell when you stay with a single individual or two and you experience some <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/a-guide-to-shared-living-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">issues</a> amongst yourselves. However, with three, you will easily balance out. </span>You tend to have fewer roommate problems when there&#8217;s one person to act as the mediating force. </p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with three roommates comes in as the house becomes more crowded and privacy is no longer there. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having roommates is a good idea from the perspective of <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-genius-apps-for-splitting-bills-with-friends" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing bills</a> in your ideal city apartment; however, you need to be keen with the choice you make. Until you are have an apartment on your own, here&#8217;s what to expect with a number of roomies. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a big question to ask yourself. Getting a roommate in New York City will affect your life, finances, sleep cycles, and general state of sanity in every way. Finding a roommate in NYC is make-or-break material, and should be treated with the same level of care you approach a car loan.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever confronted with a massive project with lots of moving parts, it helps to break it down into small, manageable pieces that can be tackled one at a time. This tactic significantly reduces the panic factor when we realize we need to uproot and transplant our entire existence in less than a month. So here is a list of smaller questions you can use to answer the looming issue of “Should I get a roommate in New York City?”</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>3 Questions To Ask Yourself Before You Find A Roommate in NYC</b></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Are you getting a roommate in New York City for the sole purpose of saving money?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s probably reason number one on the list for most people. NYC is a wealth of opportunity and excitement and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/nyc-best-place-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">priced to match</a>. If saving money is a goal for you, then you’re probably feeling financial stress like 99.9% of the rest of the world. But keep in mind that saving money is the symptom. The root cause is stress. So be really choosy when finding a roommate in New York City. Make sure this person is going to reduce your stress, and not add to it. If you don’t, then saving money won’t have accomplished your underlying goal, which is to lead a happier, healthier life.</span></p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Are there other ways to save money?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you write down everything you spend money on? I know. Ick. The mere thought of typing every expense into your phone is enough to instigate a small gag reflex. But, is the inconvenience stopping you? Or are you a leery of what you might find?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many carefree ways to pay. Swipe a card, wave a phone, and pay online through PayPal. It’s easy to lose track of it all. Which is precisely why it’s so important to get every expense written down so you can see where your money is going. Coffee at Starbucks twice a day? Going out for drinks thrice a week? Those <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/wolf-of-wall-street-lessons-to-thrive-financially-in-nyc/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">little expenses</a> add up faster than we realize with so many convenient ways to pay.</span></p>



<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be surprised if the money you could save by having a roommate could be saved with less stress by getting a studio apartment and dropping, or at least reducing <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-trim-unnecessary-spending-4129673" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">unnecessary expenses</a>.</span></i> So, factor this in before you go finding a new roommate in New York City.</p>

	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Are there other ways to reduce stress?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, let’s say you got your budget under control, or you’re one of those rare people who can balance a bank account through secret ninja techniques passed down through your family for generations. (Which qualifies as a superpower, by the way, so props to you.) If stress is still driving you into the arms of a roommate, take a step back before you commit.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you hate your job? Some workplaces are just <a href="https://www.careercontessa.com/advice/toxic-work-environment/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">toxic</a>. Long hours, low pay, and enough workplace politics to fuel fifty reality TV shows. If you are losing sleep over your workload, finding a job that pays the same but sucks way less is a logical step to go through before finding a roommate in NYC.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check other sources of stress. Relationship dragging you down? Maybe it’s time to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/friendship-20/202012/20-signs-relationship-is-over" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">break it off</a> and move on. Is your apartment really loud? Do you have a better chance of winning the lottery than parking within a mile of your own home? Finding a new apartment first might do more for your stress levels than finding a roommate in New York City.</span></p>

	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">So, do you really want a roommate in New York City apartment?</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your affairs are in order, you very well may still want to find a roommate in NYC. With the right tools you can find an excellent <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/ways-to-make-a-new-roommate-feel-welcome-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate</a> who adds to your life, not your stress load. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you invest the time to find a roommate in NYC, put together a list of everything you want to check. Asking lots of questions up front can be time-consuming, yes. And doing something like a background check can be a little intimidating at first, true. But think about it. You are about to open the door wide open, hand over a set of keys, provide easy access to all your stuff, and place your financial well-being in the hands of a complete and total stranger.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, sounds like a good time to be thorough.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Do a background check</b> if you want to find a good roommate in NYC</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a <a href="https://www.realtor.com/advice/rent/run-background-check-roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">background check</a> on a roommate is street smart. I</span>t&#8217;s not just the tatted up guys with leather jackets who might be trouble.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just look at politicians these days. Sure, they smile nice, and they’ve got pleasant things to say. But you wouldn’t trust at least half of them to babysit a basket of dirty laundry, let alone have access to your iPhone while you’re not around.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do a <b>credit check</b> when you are trying to find a roommate in NYC</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The harsh reality is that your roommate’s credit score is going to affect your ability to sign a lease. Having a great roommate can go south fast if you discover later that they have bad credit and you can’t renew. Next thing you know, you’re moving into a lousy room in a bad part of town with your super sweet, mired in credit debt roommate. Who will totally take you out to dinner to make up for it if you just spot them twenty dollars.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Do an employment check</b> when trying to find a roommate in NYC</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because someone has <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/score-basics/what-is-a-good-credit-score/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">good credit</a> doesn’t mean it’s going to stay that way. It’s a tough economy, and you might be tempted to cut someone a break. Especially if they have a plan that sounds good. But do yourself a favor and get two paystubs, or at the bare minimum, an acceptance letter for a new job with the salary right there, plain as can be. If you don’t, you could end up stuck shouldering their part of the rent on top of your own in a matter of months.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Furniture wars: avoid a broken home</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways to get tripped up by furniture and appliances: Not having enough, and having way, way too much. The latter is easier to bump into than you might think. Rooms in NYC are small. A couch is going to occupy a considerable amount of real estate. Picture this. Your roommate shows up on move-in day, dazzling you with their sunny disposition and eye-catching organizational skills. You both suddenly realize there isn’t enough room for the combined might of your couches. Your roommate is now stuck trying to find <a href="https://metropolismoving.com/blog/best-storage-facilities-nyc/" class="broken_link">storage</a> last minute or selling it fast at a lost. You are so losing your BFF card over this. </span>So th<span style="font-weight: 400;">e moral of the story</span>&#8211; sort out your furniture before anyone moves in. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Conflict is ultimately driven by resource mismanagement: AKA food</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people think it’s hilarious when other people name their sandwiches. MIA leftovers and filthy cooking areas are one of the first places roommates discover just how well they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get along. Lay the ground rules down for food and cooking during the interview. And if it gets really bad, start making sandwiches with expired anchovies and excessive abuse of hollandaise. People will steal your food less if you give them the impression you’re a terrible cook.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Parking meters: the unsung hero of utility bills</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where is your roommate going to park their car? How accessible is parking? Does your roommate have other means of transportation, like a bicycle or moped? If so, where are those going to go? Don’t make the mistake of omitting parking problems if you know it’s tough in your neighborhood and your prospective roommate fails to ask. Head off the problem before it starts.</span> So, make sure everyone is clear beforehand about parking. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>It’s better together . . . until it’s not: guests</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re roommates great. Wish you could say the same about their entourage. Mixed social gatherings, girly hordes, rambling bro-packs. Overnight guests that never seem to leave. People popping in and out, slamming doors, eating your food, taking your parking spot. The number of ways that guests can mess with your real estate relationship is literally without end. Check with your roommate beforehand to get a sense of how much socializing they plan to base out of the apartment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a perfect roommate just isn’t a thing. Doesn’t mean you can’t strive for the best! Big city or small town, it’s important to know where to start when it comes to who you choose to share toilet paper and possibly most real side of yourself with. Trying to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/find-roommates-nyc/">find</a> a good roommate is hard. So, here are 3 traits you should be looking for in a roommate.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Compatibility is important when looking for a roommate</h2>



<p><b><b><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing yourself and your own personal habits will be the key when looking for the ideal roommate. This person lives a similar lifestyle to you making for a peaceful household. If you party, don’t shack up with someone who goes to bed by 10pm. If you’re a student, find another! If you haven’t been bitten by the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-declutter-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tidy bug</a> it&#8217;s best not to choose a roommate who does the “white glove” check. The traits you should look for will be similar to the traits you possess. Know your lifestyle! </span></b></b>Because, <b><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">remember, wh</span></b></b>en trying to find a roommate<b><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; opposites do NOT attract.</span></b></b> </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are they happy?</h2>



<p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on how often you’re around happy people, this can be an easy one to spot. Living with a <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/10-things-happy-people-differently.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">happy person</a> is contagious<span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the other end, living with a notably unhappy person can be a vacuum for your energy. Try looking for a roommate who give off happy vibes. People that aren’t superficial. Because if someone seems peaceful, content, and living with purpose, the type of stability it can bring to their mood is palpable. THIS is who you want to be living with!</span></span> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are they trustworthy?</h2>



<p><b><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to tell if someone is <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-Someone-Is-Trustworthy" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">trustworthy</a></span></b> <b><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be tricky. So, plan a couple meetups before you choose to live with someone. Recognize how they treat your time. Do they agree on plans then bail? You can tell a person is trustworthy by how they value you and their commitment to the plans you’ve made together. At the earliest sign of shadiness, run. Because <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-dos-and-donts-of-sharing-an-apartment-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living with a roommate</a> you’re not sure can be trusted will be uncomfortable. So, when looking for a roommate, </span></b>try to find someone who you can trust with your life. </p>
