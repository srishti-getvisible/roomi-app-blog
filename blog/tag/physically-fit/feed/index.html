<p>From late-night binging to early morning workout sessions, there&#8217;s no better partner-in-crime than your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/science-roommate-makes-happier/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">roommate</a>. Especially since most of us now have to work from home, exercise is something that the entire household can do together. And since the holiday season has passed,  we&#8217;re all left a particularly unwanted present, namely, the dreadful holiday weight! If health &amp; fitness is on your mind, we have just the exercise routines for you to get you started while working from home. Remember, all awesome things take time! So be consistent, patient, and strict with your workout schedule. And we promise that your hard work will bring you closer to your &#8216;physically fit&#8217; goal every day! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should I exercise with my roommates as I work from home?</h2>



<p>Health &amp; fitness can be super boring to some, at least in the cold winter months when lazing around seems like the best option. However, nothing is more motivating than to have your friends/roommates join you in your attempt to add some exercise to your routine as you work from home. There&#8217;s something really comforting to see your friend sweat and slog alongside you.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Friendly competition can be a good thing when you are&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.self.com/fitness/workouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working out</a>&nbsp;because it will push you further than you would on your own. Doing this total body workout with a friend will motivate you try to keep pace with them and in turn make you complete more rounds of work than if you are doing it by yourself.&#8221; </em></p><cite><strong><em>Mat Forzaglia, Fitness Professional</em></strong></cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a good total body exercise routine to start with as I work from home?</h2>



<p>We have a great total workout routine that even beginners will enjoy. We like to call it 5 under 10, as there are 5 exercises under 10mins. It&#8217;s great for  those who have just started to exercise while working from home.</p>

Often times newbies who are enthusiastic about health &amp; fitness, end up doing exercises improperly. This results in muscle damage and injuries. To prevent such mishaps, let&#8217;s look at the correct way of doing the exercises in our 5 under 10 routine:</p>
