<p>West Point on the Eno is a 404-acre park along the Eno River in Downtown Durham. It was once home to the Shocco and Eno Indians and is now a natural and historic city park that&#8217;s a fusion of woods, waters, and wildlife. You can check out three Durham attractions here: West Point Mill, McCown-Mangum House at West Point, and Packhouse &amp; Hugh Mangum Museum of Photography.</p>



<p>Another part of the park holds the Amphitheatre at West Point where concerts, festivals, and performances are held. The park also offers picnic facilities that can accommodate up to 75 people with tables, chairs, and grills. Once you&#8217;re done eating, take in the natural area along a 5-mile trail!</p>

<p>One of the coolest things to do in Charlotte is riding the world’s tallest and fastest giga coaster! It&#8217;s a 325-foot-tall Fury 325, at Carowinds amusement park — that makes up for a great evening out in Charlotte!</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all! For over 45 years, Carowinds has been right at the heart of where the Carolinas come together, so we know a thing or two about Carolina culture. It’s something mighty special, especially in the hearts of the people of Charlotte. Located off I-77 at the NC/SC border, we have everything you need to make lifelong memories. Giggle with little ones at the crazy antics of Snoopy and the PEANUTS<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> gang at Camp Snoopy, our 12-acre children’s area filled with interactive play areas and rides. Grab a friend and scream out loud on one of our 14 world-class rollercoasters or take in a live show! Share a delicious funnel cake, and give away the last bite. Get completely soaked – again and again – at Carolina Harbor, our all-inclusive waterpark.</p>

<p>The U.S. National Whitewater Center (USNWC) is dedicated to the promotion of the active, outdoor lifestyle. Since 2006, the USNWC has been promoting access to the outdoors for all levels of participants through its all-day pass programs, instruction, leadership school as well as festivals, races, and other outdoor events. Whether you visit the Center’s 1,300 acres on the Catawba River or participate in the offsite programs featured throughout the United States, the USNWC wants you to play, relax and learn outside. But we definitely recommend going rafting in the rapids of the Catawba river!</p>

He assembled and inherited a collection of more than 1,400 artworks created by major figures of 20th-century modernism — which can now be found at this museum.</p>

<p>With its exposed ductwork, black leather couches and gorgeous bar, 5Church is without question Charlotte&#8217;s sexiest restaurant. And the man in the kitchen, chef Jamie Lynch, is a big deal. The &#8220;Top Chef&#8221; alum was named best chef by&nbsp;<em>Charlotte Magazine</em>&nbsp;in 2018.</p>



<p>Here, inside the ultra-cool boutique hotel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/charltottethe-iveys-hotel">The Ivey</a>, his menu is confident and bold, with yellowfin tuna tater tots and spiffed-up steakhouse classics, including a tomahawk for two. Sides are served family-style and—with selections like Southern street corn and white truffle cheddar mac &#8216;n&#8217; cheese. They&#8217;re the main event unto themselves.</p>

<p>Tucked into a historic home in Charlotte&#8217;s Eastover neighborhood, Stagioni beckons with its warm ambiance and blissful location away from the fray. Inside, cookbooks and wooden lamps add homey design touches to this charming Italian spot from well-known Charlotte restaurateur Bruce Moffett. Do not confuse Stagioni with a typical red-sauce joint. Although you&#8217;ll find a few pizzas and pasta, they&#8217;ll be far from familiar. Instead, expect tortellini stuffed with spicy &#8216;nduja and housemade ricotta, or seared gnocchi in a nettle pesto.</p>

<p>Honestly, just your entire family to Ayrsley Town Center. This is a complex that has rightfully earned the moniker the “Uptown of Southwest Charlotte.” You can catch a double feature at the independent Ayrsley Grand Cinemas 14, where themed film showings (retro horror, anyone?) are all the rage. But also, you must grab a post-popcorn lunch at Harry’s Grille &amp; Tavern—where you can also order a handcrafted cocktail—or Portofino’s Italian Restaurant. You&#8217;ll find some seriously hearty portions of pasta here. Shopping stops include Expressive Impressions jewelry, where something sparkly is sure to catch your eye.</p>

<p><strong>Lakeview Park</strong></p>



<p>Many different areas of Asheville have gone through cycles of growth, decline, and then re-growth. But North Asheville has been resilient. This part of the city is known to be affluent and also residential. Lakeview Park is also home to tranquil Beaver Lake, popular for fishing, boating, and paddleboarding. Lakeside paths draw joggers and dog walkers. As well as a boardwalk nature trail loops through peaceful wetlands in Beaver Lake Bird Sanctuary. The neighborhood’s winding streets also showcase homes in a mix of architectural styles, including Tudor Revival and Cape Cod!</p>



<p><strong>Town of Biltmore Forest</strong></p>

It was initially meant for people who weren’t as rich as Vanderbilts to build McMansions. Biltmore Forest is your traditional old-money neighborhood. Surprisingly yet interestingly so, the neighborhood doesn’t have any gates or guardhouses!</p>



<p><strong>Asheville Downtown</strong></p>



<p>With beautiful Art Deco architecture, a vibrant nightlife and lots of eateries, Asheville’s downtown is growing in popularity as a place to live, especially with the emergence of new condos.</p>



<p>With the renaissance of Asheville well underway, downtown residents enjoy the convenience of walking to great restaurants, live music, special events, and shopping.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">French Broad River Greenway</h3>



<p>French Broad River Park&nbsp;in&nbsp;West Asheville&nbsp;is home to vast green spaces speckled with large, old trees, and a paved greenway for biking. The 2.8-mile trail extends from the French Broad River Park and links to Hominy Creek Park and Carrier Park.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blue Ridge Parkway</h3>



<p>Although the&nbsp;Blue Ridge Parkway&nbsp;is known as “America’s Favorite Drive,” it’s also a favorite route among cyclists.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Restaurants in Asheville</h2>



<p>Asheville’s creative vibe and collaborative spirit have fueled the rapid growth of a thriving, eclectic restaurant scene. The small mountain city has a remarkably large pool of talented chefs who source inspiration from the city itself. But that&#8217;s not all!</p>



<p>Most of the restaurants in Asheville source much of their fresh ingredients from Western North Carolina’s tight-knit network of innovative farmers, foragers, and food artisans. Appalachian fare, Southern comfort food, and whole-hog barbecue mingle with flavors from Asia, Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and beyond, making for a riot of restaurant choices at mealtime.</p>



<p>Here are some of our favorite restaurants in Asheville:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Historical spots in Asheville</h2>



<p>Some of the most famous historical spots include the affluent Montford Area Historic District. This historic area features distinctive Queen Anne, Arts and Crafts, and Colonial Revival houses, many now restored as B&amp;Bs. Each summer, the Montford Park Players bring crowds to Hazel Robinson Amphitheatre for the outdoor Shakespeare Festival. Authors Thomas Wolfe and O. Henry are among those buried in the sprawling Riverside Cemetery, which has flower gardens and statue-topped mausoleums.</p>



<p>Then there&#8217;s the Biltmore Estate — which is a historic house museum and tourist attraction in Asheville, North Carolina. Biltmore House, the main residence, is a Châteauesque-style mansion built for George Washington Vanderbilt II between 1889 and 1895 and is the largest privately owned house in the United States, at 178,926 square feet of floor space. It is still owned by George Vanderbilt&#8217;s descendants, and remains one of the most prominent examples of Gilded Age mansions.</p>
