										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Making a living while doing something we&#8217;re passionate about gives us a kind of personal freedom that most people crave. Pursuing our passions, whether they are in the form of a service, a hobby, or a business, is fundamental to reaching the most authentic version of us. Even if pursuing your passion means a change in profession, we must consider it, no matter what the stakes.<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/mindful-habits-for-your-mental-health-during-covid-19/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> What is this life, If we cannot stop for a second and marvel at every day and find joy in the little things</a>? It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;ve found your passion or are in the middle of exploring new horizons and finding a change in career for yourself. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a valuable takeaway for you from this blog.</p>

<p>To clarify, changing jobs is moving to a similar position with a different employer and is usually relatively easy. Changing careers is a more in-depth shift and usually means moving to another industry, which requires an entirely different perspective. A career change usually means additional learning, retraining, and beginning a new career path from scratch.&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hobby-clubs-and-classes-in-new-york-where-you-can-meet-new-people-part-3/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">It isn&#8217;t easy and requires a leap of faith&nbsp;and a bit of bravery.</a></p>



<p>It&#8217;s never too late to make a career change. The timing needs to be right, with a strong foundation and a plan to move ahead. The hardest part is convincing yourself that you&#8217;re ready to do it â€“ <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-signs-time-move/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">and that you CAN do it</a>! To make a meaningful change, we want to highlight the preparation required. The suggestions here will help in preparing you for your career change. Are you ready?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-decide-where-you-want-to-go-next">1. Decide where you want to go next</h3>



<p>Take time to decide on what you would like to do next. It pays to know who you are, what makes you happy, and your strengths and weaknesses. <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/7-career-tips-for-college-seniors-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Have you considered freelancing or starting a business?</a> Ask yourself some key questions to understand the direction you want to take.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-upgrade-your-skillset">2. Upgrade your skillset</h3>



<p>Check if you have the right skill set to move forward to mold your passion into your career. Suppose you have decided to become a freelance web developer. Can you code? Do you need to enhance your skills before forging a career? Do you require a web development course and need to build yourself a portfolio before making it your full-time profession? If you&#8217;re considering a move into data analysis or data science, enhancing your skillset with an <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">introductory R course</a> can be incredibly beneficial. The ability to handle complex analyses and large datasets is crucial in these fields. This course offers foundational knowledge that can serve as a stepping-stone for further learning and career advancement in various data-related tracks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-find-a-mentor">3. Find a mentor</h3>



<p>Having a mentor in your field can prove invaluable at this time, more so if you want to start your own business. Listen and follow your mentors closely, and don&#8217;t assume that you know everything already. As they are ahead in your field, build a relationship with them where you can ask them a zillion questions to clarify things in your mind and learn from their experiences.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-grow-your-network">4. Grow your network</h3>



<p>You may be eager to get out of your current job as quickly as possible. Still, handing in your resignation too soon could prove disastrous. Begin by building a support network while you&#8217;re at your current job. If you plan to freelance, your existing network is your best link to your future work. Use your contacts and build a relationship with people who might be of help. One meaningful way to move ahead with a successful career change is to realize that you don&#8217;t have to do it alone.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-you-are-your-own-brand">5. You are your own brand!</h3>



<p>You are your own unique selling point. Many people ignore this, but you can use your Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter to contact other professionals in your field. What you&#8217;re essentially selling here is trust to your clients/ customers in a market that seems brand new to you. Feel free to reach out and ask people in your area for help or advice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-set-your-goals-write-a-plan-of-action">6. Set your goals/ Write a plan of action</h3>

<p>It is a good idea to work backward. Outline your goals for the year detailing out your aims for the upcoming six months, and the following six weeks. Your first goal is to set yourself goals. Write daily objectives &#8211; small things you want to achieve over the next few months to get you out of your job and into a better career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many people look at failing in a negative light. But it&#8217;s important to remember that failure means that you&#8217;re trying. To err is human; no matter how successful you get, be assured that you&#8217;re still going to make mistakes. So it&#8217;s okay to make career mistakes too &#8211; we all do it!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I&#8217;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I&#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.&#8221;</p><cite><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Being mindful about career mistakes and learning from them will bring you a step closer to personal growth and success. Many people with high-pressure jobs spend their entire careers geared towards reaching their desired position but end up dreading their career journey. If you&#8217;re struggling at work, have just began your career or know someone who&#8217;s feeling stuck at work, continue reading. Here are some of the biggest career mistakes you can avoid (or make them and lean from them!)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Letting another person make your career decisions = biggest career mistake!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:55%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/HozfRdy8Qe4hVsbkk2" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/HozfRdy8Qe4hVsbkk2/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Each person is unique with their own set of experiences, thought patterns and preferences. You might turn to your best buddies for an outfit approval while shopping or you might seek approval from your parents when you&#8217;re making a big life decision but remember that it&#8217;s YOU in the end who has to deal with all consequences- good or bad. When it comes to your career, it&#8217;s natural to consult your core group, but don&#8217;t let your inner voice drown out. Trust your gut and find your inner voice of reason and make that voice your priority.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Not being able to balance your personal &amp; professional life</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/111LSMM1ICPqBq" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/111LSMM1ICPqBq/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>We usually spend eight to ten hours of our day at work &#8211; maybe more &#8211; so it&#8217;s understandable that some of us might make work our identity. Before your career takes an all assuming role, remember that finding balance in life is like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. A healthy life comprises of a good balance of work, family, friends, and mental health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. A perception that once you choose a field, you are stuck with it forever is one of the most common career mistakes</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:42%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l4FGquSwfx52EPXzO" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FGquSwfx52EPXzO/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Many of us think it is impossible to switch career paths after training and gaining experience in a particular domain. If you want, you can gradually transition to other fields. In today&#8217;s digital world, you&#8217;re subconsciously learning new things through social media, so focus on marketable skills and keep your eyes open for opportunities of your interest. You never know what you can achieve.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Burning all bridges</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6v4VaKAwgmLoA" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/6v4VaKAwgmLoA/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>It might seem right to sever all contacts and say good riddance when switching to your new career. Whatever be your reason for moving on, and whether you had a good experience or a bad one, keep networking with your old employer, you never know when you will require their help or reference.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Assuming you&#8217;re indispensable</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:53%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/HFHovXXltzS7u" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/HFHovXXltzS7u/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Never think of yourself as indispensable &#8211; feel grateful that you have the opportunity to contribute at work. Nobody is bigger than the organization and its goals. If you are not contributing, you might be a burden to the company. One example is Uber, where the founder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/technology/uber-travis-kalanick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Travis Kalanick was forced to resign</a> in 2017. Don&#8217;t know about you but it can be difficult for some folks to avoid career mistakes such as this one! Esp. if you&#8217;re a workaholic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Talking bad and gossiping is the worst career mistake out there!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT9KVuimKtly3zoJ0Y" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9KVuimKtly3zoJ0Y/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>The &#8216;mean girls&#8217; approach just doesn&#8217;t cut it at work. Avoid negativity at the workplace, and at all costs, avoid gossiping &#8211; negative things bubble up very quickly, noise gets created, and you will be found out sooner rather than later. Never ever jeopardize your relationship with anyone in your current organization. The industry is such a funny place, you&#8217;ll not even know when your current manager will be your lead in your forthcoming career path, OR your future plans might not fall in place, and you might have to take help from your current employer.</p>

<p>So you just had a job interview and you did everything you could. From <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/five-tips-to-spruce-up-your-resume/1516/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sprucing up your resume</a> to making sure you looked your best- you did everything to the best of your abilities. You took the time out to sharpen your professional skills before you even applied for the job. You were prepared for all the interview questions and came across as confident and trustworthy. It ended with &#8216;Thank you, we&#8217;ll get back to you&#8217;. But it&#8217;s been an hour since you left the interview room and patience is running out by the minute. Come night time, and you can&#8217;t sleep thinking about what you should and shouldn&#8217;t have said. </p>



<p>You might feel tempted to get up in the morning and call or email your interviewer asking if you got the job. But you worry if they don&#8217;t reply, you might end up being even more stressed out.</p>

<p>What you need to do, first of all &#8211; is calm down! The truth is, you gave it your all, and your interviewers might be busy. You&#8217;ll probably get that job; remember that it could all take longer than you expected. And of course, we all know &#8216;good things come to those who wait.&#8217;</p>



<p>But if you&#8217;re thinking what the heck you&#8217;re supposed to do while you wait, we&#8217;ve got your worried back.</p>



<p>Read up on our top tips to handle the anxiety and do something productive with your time while you wait to hear back from your job interview.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Don&#8217;t stop looking for the next job interview</h2>



<p>The not-so-easy to accept truth of the matter is, your interviewer might be doing the same thing. They might have a couple of interviews lined up (yes, even after YOU showed up).  And they will come to a decision only when they&#8217;ve gone through all the job interviews with the shortlisted candidates.</p>



<p>Instead of constantly worrying about and praying to hear back, you should keep applying to and exploring other <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job opportunities</a>. If finances are the main worry, you should also look for side hustles to stay safe and get another source of income as soon as you can. This might even distract you from the previous interview since you&#8217;ll be busy looking at other company profiles and preparing for interviews with them. Plus, the more interview questions you answer, the better you get at it!</p>

<p>If you fear your skills might soon be outdated, take this time to<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/sharpen-your-professional-skills-in-quarantine-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> improve your skills</a>. It&#8217;s never too late to sharpen your professional skills! </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. What job interview? Read that fat book. </h2>



<p>While a job is essential to survival, it&#8217;s not the end-all and the only purpose of life. There&#8217;s a vast world out there waiting for you to engage your curiosity. If you&#8217;ve been putting off a great book that you always wanted to read but had no time for when you were working &#8211; NOW is the time!</p>



<p>If you come to like the book, you&#8217;ll easily be distracted from the anxiety of waiting to hear back from the job interview. Apart from killing time, reading a good book will help you transcend into another reality that might have vast knowledge to offer on the way. And maybe, it&#8217;ll help you prepare for interview questions the next time around. </p>



<p>If you need some help, <a href="https://www.hannahbrenchercreative.com/blog/quarantinereadinglist" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here&#8217;s a great list of books</a> you can check out!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Play hard to get</h2>



<p>Okay you&#8217;re done with the job interview and the million different interview questions. Now, it&#8217;s a good idea to send your interviewer an appreciation email for taking out the time to meet you. Just resist the urge to send multiple follow-ups, which can end up annoying your prospective employer.</p>



<p>So it would work best for you if you don&#8217;t email or call them repeatedly or check-in immediately. Play it cool. (even if you aren&#8217;t)</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Commence online detective work</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re eagerly waiting to hear back from a job interview, and there&#8217;s nothing else you can focus on, put your time and energy into researching the company. After all, if you are daydreaming about getting a positive reply, you should know how to respond when that call finally comes in.</p>



<p>So after you sigh at your daydreams, be the digital Sherlock Holmes you are and uncover whatever you can about the company: its employees, its products and services, and whatever else you stumble upon. Plus this is a great way to sharpen your professional skills. If your profession is being a world class spy. </p>



<p>This research will help you determine where and how you fit into the company and whether you would indeed be happy if you were to join. </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Meditate</h2>



<p>Calm down your anxious mind with meditation. Whenever you feel tempted to refresh your email app a zillion times or check your phone every minute to see if they&#8217;ve responded, deny yourself the panic-stricken joy. Lie down in a dimly lit area in your house and focus on your breath. Let the thoughts come in and go as they please. Choose not to interact with them. You&#8217;ll find a much-needed sense of calm and sail through with lesser effort that panic requires you to put in. You&#8217;ll also find that meditating helps sharpen your professional skills. It&#8217;s magical!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020 unleashed a load of unexpected change in all our lives. The pandemic altered and disturbed the natural course of our professional and academic growth, slowing down our skills development and practices. This has rendered many of us feeling doubtful about our future. Most of us are spending time moping and hanging on our phones all day, trying to figure out life until we can begin living normally again.</p>



<p>Take it from us: it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way! Many students and graduates are adding to their professional developmental skills using all their free quarantine time. If you&#8217;re feeling up to it, why not see what you can achieve? (We can see your mom nodding approvingly at the back). So here&#8217;s a list of professional skills that can boost your job opportunities and help you use your precious quarantine time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-fix-your-resume">1. Fix your resume!</h2>



<p>When was the last time you updated or fixed your resume? This task is probably the most procrastinated of &#8217;em all. The quarantine may be a great time to dust it off; a professional resume needs a different kind of treatment compared to a high school resume.Â <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/cv-format-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Your professional resume must entail</a>Â skills, projects, and experiences aligned with your goal. If your goal is to become a copywriter, make sure to include any experience and skills that support your goal. Add class projects, internships, research, new skills, and student involvement in your resume. There are some great tools like Canva, visme that offer awesome templates for free and will sweep your interviewer off their feet because they not only help you in getting your first interview but with the help of such interactive content creation tools you can make your interview assignment look even more appealing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-take-up-college-courses-and-learn-new-skills">2. Take up college courses and learn new skills</h2>



<p>Studying at Yale or Stanford is easier than ever with&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coursera</a>. This site lets you choose from nearly 3,900 online courses from more than 190 prominent universities and businesses from around the globe. You can get college credits or a certification depending on the course model you choose. The learning curve is endless here, and most courses that teach you are free on this site. Other options for free and affordable skills development courses include <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edX</a> and <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.futurelearn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">FutureLearn</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-build-your-online-presence">3. Build your online presence</h2>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re a writer, digital marketer, data analyst, or web designer â€“ your online presence can help you get more clients and work. Here are some practices that will help you do so during quarantine:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linkedin-nbsp">LinkedIn&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Get your LinkedIn profile up to date using the content from your resume.&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/how-to-make-your-profile-stand-out-on-linkedin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revamp your LinkedIn profile to stand out</a>; choose a great photo and invest in LinkedIn Learnings. All of these efforts are worth it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-media-platforms">Social media platforms</h3>



<p>Businesses around the world are leveraging top platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to build and maintain their presence. You, too, can <a href="https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/10-steps-to-building-your-personal-brand-on-social-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harness social mediaâ€™s strength</a> by presenting your work and connecting yourself with like-minded individuals/businesses. Using tools like an <a href="https://murf.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI voice generator</a>, you can create engaging audio content to complement your posts on these platforms. These low-cost platforms can enable your work to be seen worldwide and noticed within your personal network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-website-nbsp">Website&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Another great tool to display your portfolio is via your own site. A neat and user-friendly website can speak volumes and scream, &#8220;I am so professional, I have a website, you guys!&#8221; Some popular user-friendly sites include&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wix.com/html5en/in-hiker-create?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2-G7jLOO6wIVVwQrCh0UKQfnEAAYASAAEgIQVPD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wix</a>,&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://webflow.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=general-paid-branded&amp;utm_term=keyword-targeting&amp;utm_content=branded-ads&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5LLMw7OO6wIVSgwrCh2O_gMmEAAYASAAEgLWTPD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Webflow</a>, and&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wordpress.com/create/?v=india_go_to_market&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=google_wpcom_search_brand_desktop_in_en&amp;utm_medium=paid_search&amp;keyword=wordpress&amp;creative=329641414965&amp;campaignid=683204332&amp;adgroupid=31861711621&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;targetid=kwd-313411415&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9JzB2bOO6wIVzBErCh3EwgxtEAAYASAAEgI2UfD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-new-professional-skills-learn-a-new-language">4. New professional skills: Learn a new language</h2>



<p>Being fluent in a second language adds extra oomph to your resume. This valuable skill can also help you get job placements in your dream state/city. Learning a new language needs patience and time, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-places-to-learn-a-new-language-online-for-fre.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">some great mobile apps</a>&nbsp;are making this process easy and fun, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duolingo&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.babbel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Babble</a>.</p>

There&#8217;s just so much you can pick up online â€“ from millions of courses, tutorials, and classes, you have material for skills development that can last you a lifetime. From cool video editing software to intense Ted Talks on building businesses, the world is your playground or workground (depending on how you perceive work).</p>

<p>Troubling to some, exciting to others, there&#8217;s a persistent question that comes around no matter what stage of life we may be tackling. It&#8217;s the question of planning your future, planning your career. This thought could surface in discussion with friends, your family, a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/answers-to-6-most-common-job-interview-questions-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job interviewer,</a> or your brain at 3 am. One of the biggest reasons that the majority of us don&#8217;t like to think about the future, or come up with a career plan for our future, has been backed by science. </p>



<p>Studies suggest that our <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/04/why-people-are-so-bad-at-thinking-about-the-future.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brains think of our future selves as strangers.</a> But this doesn&#8217;t mean we should let ourselves off the hook. In fact, it gives us an opportunity to think about our future selves with empathy and care, like we would other people.</p>



<p>We know it&#8217;s tough, and we&#8217;ve mostly come to associate this superhuman skill with the highest achievers, justifying to ourselves that we&#8217;re not one of them. So to make things easier, we&#8217;ve listed a few things you could think about to think about the future. It&#8217;s time to think about thinking about putting our thinking caps on! Yes, there&#8217;s quite a lot of thinking ahead.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506784850319-305956726452?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80" alt="person holding orange pen on to of journal beside Stabilo Boss highlighter, tracking her mood on a self made mood tracker in her journal, as she takes on her career plan"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Have a plan, but also, don&#8217;t have a plan</h2>



<p>Sounds confusing? Because it is! When you think about the future, the first thing that might come to mind is to make a plan that you could follow.</p>



<p>Maybe two years back, like a lot of us, you made a plan to travel the world in 2020. You know what we&#8217;re getting at. Plans tend to fail or get postponed. So don&#8217;t set rigorous timelines to whatever it is that you plan to do, whether you&#8217;re considering personal development or professional development backed by a career plan.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a clichÃ© because it makes sense to focus on your journey instead of your destination. Do that, and you&#8217;ll forget to ask, &#8216;Are we there yet?&#8217;</p>



<p>So have a general plan outlined, and fill in the colors on your beautiful and fulfilling journey as you go along.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Work for the tomorrow you want, today!</h2>



<p>If you wish to achieve a goal tomorrow, you have to start today! Maybe your career plan is to have your own business someday or have a job that gives you the freedom to travel. Whatever your dream is, wake up and start working towards it now. Put in the required amount of work for personal development and start becoming the person you want to be tomorrow from today. Like they say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t dress for the job you have, but for the one you want.&#8217;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Actively participate in your present to change your future</h2>



<p>Simply cribbing about your present and longing for a desirable future isn&#8217;t going to cut it. Everything you desire as a part of your professional or personal development has to be embedded into your life now. If you have some complaints about any current aspects of your life &#8211; maybe you have trouble managing your work hours, or perhaps you dislike the work you do for a living &#8211; it&#8217;s time to do something about it.</p>



<p>You need to start figuring out how and then start working towards eliminating what you don&#8217;t like. If it is out of your control, you could try changing your perception towards it. But your problems won&#8217;t disappear on their own, and your dreams won&#8217;t materialize on their own either.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Have someone to look up to</h2>



<p>One of the best ways for personal development is learning from other people. There is always something to learn if you look in the right direction. Make it a point to look up to someone you admire. Maybe it&#8217;s not someone who has it all, but someone who constantly works towards achieving what they need. It could be one of your friends, one of your relatives, your colleagues, or an inspiring TED talk. Let someone inspire you to become the best version of you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Don&#8217;t expect to know all the answers</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Because you can&#8217;t.</li><li>Life might become a very tedious ride if you have all the answers.</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>2020, for most of us, promised a bounty of opportunities, great clients, better paychecks, and a bright future. Well, many thanks to the pandemic, all our careers have taken a back seat without our consent. Due to this, we all have spent time grappling with the realities of life these past few months. So now, it&#8217;s time we use all the spare time to find motivation and fine-tune our personal development. Let&#8217;s find alternate ways to make our careers work for us!</p>



<p>Our&nbsp;recommendation&nbsp;would be to get stuck into some of these self-help books that will serve as&nbsp;career advice&nbsp;and motivation for all those seeking clarity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>1. David &amp; Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants</em>&nbsp;by Malcolm Gladwell</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;You can&#8217;t concentrate on doing anything if you are thinking, &#8220;What&#8217;s gonna happen if it doesn&#8217;t go right?&#8221; </em></p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/1439.Malcolm_Gladwell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malcolm Gladwell</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Gladwell&#8217;s narration in this book draws examples from infamous stories, how the world perceives them, and the reality. As humans, we instinctively avoid conflict and paths that look dangerous or unsafe. The book walks the readers through an array of stories and compelling historical examples of how someone who may look small can surprisingly be tough and beat the big.</p>



<p><em>Goodreads Rating: 4.34/5</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <em>So Good They Can&#8217;t Ignore You</em> by Cal Newport</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;the happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do. On reflection, this makes sense.&#8221; </em></p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/147891.Cal_Newport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cal Newport</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Most people feel that success comes from following your heart and passions. But Cal Newport begs to differ from this point of view. Newport says that developing skills rather than focussing on desires you already have is the key to successful job experiences. In addition, the book curates&nbsp;career advice&nbsp;by interviewing some of the most successful people; it has advice from everyone from farmers, venture capitalists, and freelancers. These interviews help the reader discover strategies and&nbsp;<strong>career management</strong>&nbsp;skills and personal development tips to enhance their job experiences.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <em>The Third Door</em> by Alex Banayan</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;You have a choice,&#8221; Dan said. &#8220;You can be good at those twenty-five things or you can be world-class at the five. Most people have so many things they want to do that they never do a single thing well. If I&#8217;ve learned one thing from Mr. Buffett, it&#8217;s that the Avoidance List is the secret to being world-class.&#8221; &#8220;Success,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is a result of prioritizing your desires.&#8221;</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/17391335.Alex_Banayan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Banayan</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This book is a result of an eighteen-year-old tracking some of the most influential celebrities and businessmen and uncovering their secrets to success. Consequently, in all of his adventures, he learned what all these influential people had in common â€“ the &#8216;third door.&#8217; </p>



<p>These successful individuals didn&#8217;t wait in line or follow the norms that most people support. Instead, they barged their way into success with hard work and determination. Not only does the book teaches tons of valuable lessons on building a robust network, but you also learn how to approach your potential clients online and ways to handle rejections.</p>
