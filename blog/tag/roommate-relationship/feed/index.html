<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. New year&#8217;s resolution for you and your roommate: Communication!</h2>



<p>One of the most important new years resolutions with your roommate has to be of communication! Communication is absolutely key in any healthy roomi relationship. Your roommate is not a mind reader, even if you think they are! If something is bothering you, make sure to bring it up with your roomi. Talk it out so that the issue doesn’t become bigger.</p>



<p>This is one of the new year&#8217;s resolutions for you and your roommate that helps better understand one another’s personality and living habits. Instead of being passive-aggressive when your roomi forgets to do the dishes, bring up the issue in a non-threatening way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. New year&#8217;s resolution with your roommate: Go over your roommate agreement</h2>



<p>If you haven’t already made one, make resolutions for you and your roommate to create an agreement for 2021! A roommate agreement helps you and your roommate better understand each other’s expectations. Roommate agreements don’t have to be set in stone, they can change as you and your roomi grow as individuals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Areas to cover in your roommate agreement can include </h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>personal boundaries, </li><li>how to handle cleaning,</li><li>how to handle rent and other expenses, </li><li>quiet hours, etc. </li></ul>



<p>Communicate with your roomi to see what they’d like to add to your roommate agreement for the new year!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. New year&#8217;s resolution for you and your roommate: Talk about finances</h2>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-best-money-saving-apps-to-reach-your-finance-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Talking about finances can be a tricky subject, but it doesn’t have to be!</a> Make a new year&#8217;s resolution with your roommate to plan a designated time each month to go over your money expectations and expenses. Make sure that you plan talking to your roomi about finances early on. So that you start 2021 off on the right foot.</p>



<p>First, make sure you have established a monthly budget for you and your roommate. Go over how to handle paying rent as well as other utility bills, such as the electricity and the internet. Next, make sure that you <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.splitwise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agree on an app</a> or a self made system detailing how bills will be paid. Check in with your roomi every month to make sure that all bills are being paid on time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. New year&#8217;s resolution with your roommate: Split up your chores</h2>



<p>Let’s face it, no one enjoys doing the dishes. So one way to help decrease confusion around who’s responsible for doing what chores is to make new year&#8217;s resolutions for you and your roommate to create a monthly chore calendar. Additionally, creating a schedule will help the two of you stick to a routine and keep your apartment clean and tidy. So have fun with making your schedule by choosing a pretty calendar and using colorful markers!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Plan time during the week to bond with your roomi</h2>



<p>It can be hard to find time to sit down and have one on one time, even if your roommate is your BFF. So it’s important to set aside time to bond with your roomi regularly. </p>



<p>Coordinate a set time every week or so when you and your roomi can bond. Whether it’s going out to eat at a restaurant or staying in and watching your favorite movie on Netflix, your roomi will be happy to spend time with you no matter what you’re doing!</p>
