										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s January 2021. The days are short, dark and cold. You&#8217;d rather be sleeping in or <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/7-motivational-movies-for-young-professionals-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">watching a motivational movie</a>, instead of motivating yourself to work from home. But whether it&#8217;s school assignments or the work emails that you&#8217;re ignoring, you know you would have to get to it eventually.</p>



<p>And after you&#8217;ve finally <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/convince-your-boss-to-let-you-work-remotely-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">convinced your boss to let you work remotely</a>, it might be even harder to convince YOURSELF to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/20-work-from-home-relatable-memes-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">work from home</a>. Trust us, we know!</p>



<p>So we thought we&#8217;d list down some of the ways we motivate ourselves to work from home, even when we don&#8217;t want to! Because let&#8217;s face it, the guilt of not working, clubbed with the anxiety of work piling up through the days is a tougher path to navigate than actually sitting down to work.</p>



<p>So push the quilts away, make a nice cuppa and get to work, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/health-wellness-tips-from-reddit-users-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you lazy bum</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Stop thinking about how much work you have</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s some advice for all the winter procrastinators in the work from home era &#8211; stop substituting any real work with to-do lists!</p>



<p>Shush that inner monologue that keeps yapping about how much work you have, how you&#8217;ll never get on with it, and the many time management skills you lack to make it happen. Trust that once you begin, the satisfaction of ticking things off your to do list on your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/5-tips-on-juggling-home-and-office-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work desk</a> will make up for the time you spend away from your bed!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Baby steps; you&#8217;re a grown-up now</h2>



<p>You&#8217;re not a baby anymore. You sure wish you were, when everything was done for you, and people had to work for you instead of the other way around. But one thing that we can learn from our baby days is to take tiny, baby steps whenever we feel stuck in our adult lives.</p>



<p>Check your work from home to-do list for loopholes. Do you have ambiguous or long term tasks laid down in their entirety? If yes, break them down into doable baby-sized tasks.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Begin somewhere</h2>



<p>Another challenge of working from home and dreaming of conjuring up time management skills, instead of getting to work is that you still get no work done and waste so much time in the process.</p>



<p>So push thoughts like &#8216;omg when am I going to finish my work&#8217; away, and acknowledge the fact that there is no finish line, especially when you work from home!</p>



<p>So just start somewhere! Block an amount of time and start work on the task you would enjoy the most &#8211; or something that&#8217;s easy. Addict yourself to the ticks on your to-do list and you&#8217;ll be working through it like the total boss you are!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. But it&#8217;s so boring, and Netflix is asking me whether I&#8217;m still watching!</h2>



<p>Think about it this way &#8211; you&#8217;d never have anything to watch if people didn&#8217;t get up and get to their tasks with proper time management skills. Even in a seemingly exciting world of entertainment such as a Netflix job, there must be some very boring tasks that people needed to do to get that content out to you. So take inspiration from Netflix if that&#8217;s holding you back, and get to work!</p>



<p>If a job is extra boring and you just don&#8217;t want to do it, make it exciting for yourself! <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/4-tips-to-stop-hating-your-job-all-the-time-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop saying you hate your job</a> and focus your energy on the positive aspects &#8211; like working in your PJs!</p>



<p>Take advantage of the work from home lifestyle, put on some good <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13JaEgvqDn2i1B4M5JzkJZ?si=FNrft5AJRV-GG-8JigATFQ" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">music you can head bang to</a>, and get clicking or typing. The one good thing at the end of all of this is &#8211; you can get back to Netflix right after!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Think about the rewards!</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of making lists like we are, here&#8217;s something you might like to do when you work from home:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><em>Make a solid time management schedule.</em></li><li>M<em>ake a list of the number of reasons why you need to get the task at hand done.</em></li><li>P<em>roceed to list down how you&#8217;ll feel when you&#8217;ve finally done it.</em></li><li>M<em>ake a list of the activities you can enjoy or the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/6-comedy-movies-to-watch-when-you-hate-your-job-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">movies you can watch</a> once you&#8217;ve done it.</em></li></ol>



<p>Be strict and don&#8217;t reward yourself until you complete what you have to. If there&#8217;s a lot to do and it will take weeks to finish, learn more about time management and make a plan that allows you small rewards for small tasks everyday and a BIG reward for when it&#8217;s finally all done.</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Now stop reading articles online already and start working!</p>



<p>Okay, just one more article, you say?

<p>It can be hard to establish an exercise routine when working from home &#8211; well, one we actually stick to, anyways. Working from home has given us extra time to complete chores, take on side projects, and enhance our skills. People are spending less time commuting every day, which has given us a new kind of flexibility in our schedules. But one part of our day hasn&#8217;t changed &#8211; and that&#8217;s our need to practice an everyday fitness routine.</p>



<p>We all know that regular physical activity keeps us fit. With more time to individualize our schedules, we may be under the impression that it gets easier to move around. But the reality for many of us is that finding the motivation to stay active is proving to be more difficult than we expected.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems when working from home is sitting for long hours at your desk. According to <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/health-promotion/physical-activity" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">research conducted by the WHO</a>, 31% of individuals who are 15 years of age or older are physically inactive, and approximately 3.2 million deaths per year are attributed to this unhealthy behavior. The result of sitting all day poses a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618737/#:~:text=Sedentary%20and%20sitting%20behavior%20in,death%20%5B9%2C10%5D" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">risk factor</a> for cardio-metabolic disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and coronary artery disease. Exercise also <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/#:~:text=Exercise%20improves%20mental%20health%20by,self%2Desteem%20and%20cognitive%20function.&amp;text=Exercise%20has%20also%20been%20found,self%2Desteem%20and%20social%20withdrawal.)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improves mental health</a> by reducing anxiety and elevating your mood. Here are some exercises that you can do while you&#8217;re sitting on your workstation or when you&#8217;re taking a break from work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chair exercises</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Torso stretch</h3>



<p>When sitting at your workstation, you can easily do <a href="https://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/exercises.asp?exercise=62" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">torso stretches</a> to energize yourself. It also helps you to maintain the correct posture. While sitting on the chair, intertwine your fingers and spread them upwards and backward repetitively. Repeat 5 – 10 times.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Spinal twist</h3>



<p>The spinal twist is a perfect stretch to soothe your tired back muscles from constantly sitting on the chair. First, sit straight with your feet flat on the floor and gently twist your torso on the axis. Stretch only to a comfortable point, making sure you don&#8217;t overstretch. Then repeat the exercise in the opposite direction. Repeat for a minute or two.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Chest opener</h3>



<p>You need to slide a little on the edge of the chair and hold the backrest&#8217;s sides with your arms. Stretch your body as you clasp the backrest. Hold for a minute to feel a little looser and more open.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" data-attachment-id="2610" data-permalink="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/exercises-to-do-when-youre-working-from-home-roomi/attachment/kdjsvkjsdnkjs/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kdjsvkjsdnkjs.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,360" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="kdjsvkjsdnkjs" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kdjsvkjsdnkjs.jpg?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kdjsvkjsdnkjs.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kdjsvkjsdnkjs.jpg?resize=640%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="Healthy, Exercises, Easy exercises , working from home " class="wp-image-2610" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kdjsvkjsdnkjs.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/blog2.roomiapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kdjsvkjsdnkjs.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption>Image Source &#8211; <a href="https://www.republiclab.com/stretching-on-chair/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Re + Public</a></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Neck stretch</h3>



<p>A neck stretch requires a combination of breathing and stretching at the same time. Keeping your back straight and feet flat on the floor, gently rotate your neck. Breathe in and out in sync as you move your neck. Continue for a minute or two to feel refreshed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Indoor exercises</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Squats</h3>



<p>The best way to start a <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/squat-4-common-squat-mistakes-avoid/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">squat</a> is to stand straight, keeping your legs facing forward with feet slightly turned out, and cross your arms. Now try and sit down without your hands&#8217; support and stand up once you reach a full bend in your legs. Go for at least 10 reps, but keep at it if your stamina allows. Your aching muscles might be screaming at you in the first few days, but keep going and you&#8217;ll soon get used to it! You might even find it fun&#8230;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Pushups</h3>



<p>For beginners, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/pushups-everyday#how-to" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushups</a> might seem a little difficult, but with continuous practice, you can get it right. Pushups are a bit like a plank without the lumbar support of your forearm. Push down with your palms on the floor to move upwards and then downwards, in sync with both hands. Go for 5-7 repetitions, and you can slowly increase on the number once you get comfortable. Pushups are useful for building your core strength, but if you&#8217;re struggling to get one, start on your knees and build up to straight legs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Jump rope</h3>



<p>Skipping is fun and involves motor skills, concentration, and body strength. In a way, it is an entire package for your body, mind, and soul. 10 -15 minutes is sufficient for a beginner (though it gets us sweating after just one minute!)</p>
