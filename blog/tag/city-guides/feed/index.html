<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Sacramento</h2>



<p>A Spanish writer with the Moraga expedition wrote about Sacramento:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;Canopies of oaks and cottonwoods, many festooned with grapevines, overhung both sides of the blue current. Birds chattered in the trees and big fish darted through the pellucid depths. The air was like champagne, and (the Spaniards) drank deep of it, drank in the beauty around them. &#8220;Â¡Es como el sagrado sacramento! (It&#8217;s like the Blessed Sacrament.)&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Hence, the valley and the river were christened after the&nbsp;<em>&#8220;Most Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ&#8221;</em>, referring to the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>



<p>Long after it was discovered, Sacramento was known as the &#8216;City of Plains&#8217; due to lack of trees. Thereafter, it was developed into being nicknamed the &#8216;City of Trees&#8217; by planting imported trees in the urban landscape.</p>



<p>Sacramento has also been declared the sunniest location on Earth from July through September every year. In July, it gets an average of 14 hours of&nbsp;<a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/why-natural-light-is-the-best-apartment-decor-ever/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunshine</a>&nbsp;per day! Something to surely remember about life in Sacramento when you&#8217;re finding rooms for rent in Sacramento.</p>



<p>Along with all that, Sacramento boasts an extensive park system consisting of over 5,000 acres of parkland and recreation centers too. So if you&#8217;re on the hunt for rooms for rent in Sacramento, be assured, greenery and scenic beauty comes along with the life in Sacramento!</p>

<p>When finding rooms for rent in Sacramento, you should know that the city groups most of its neighborhoods into four areas, namely, Area One, Two, Three &amp; Four.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top neighborhoods in Sacramento</h2>

<p>Named for the 19 acre park at the center of the neighborhood, it lies close to the US Davis Medical Center, and the Shriner&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Hospital. So it essentially attracts professionals working in these institutions and young families.</p>

<p>Located about 3 miles east of downtown, East Sacramento is one of the most walkable neighborhoods in the city. So if that&#8217;s in your checklist when finding rooms for rent in Sacramento, this neighborhood is the one for you.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Governorâs Mansion and Leland Stanford Mansion</h3>



<p>A 30 room mansion built in 1877, it stores all objects left by previous governor residents, which includes a 1902 Steinway piano, hand tied Persian carpets, and more. You can view it all through the museum&#8217;s daily tours.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tower Bridge</h3>



<p>Across the Sacramento river, connecting West and East, is the beautiful golden tower bridge. One that you would not miss to visit anyway. Originally painted silver, popular votes transformed it into getting the gold color it has now.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">California State Capitol</h3>



<p>Modernized repeatedly, the California State Capitol was built in 1860. Now it is both a museum and the work place of the state government. Enjoy knowing about the history of the structure through its guided tours and historic films (all free of cost.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Washington DC</h2>



<p>Truly encompassing all that is American, Washington DC is home to many national monuments and museums, along with foreign embassies, as well as the headquarters of many international organizations, trade unions, non-profits, lobbying groups, and professional associations, including the National Geographic Society, the Human Rights Campaign, and the American Red Cross to name a few.</p>

The district has 7,464 acres of parkland! And that too,&nbsp;<strong><em>about 19%</em></strong>&nbsp;of the city&#8217;s total area. This makes it the best city to live in if greenery is what you look for when finding a place to live in!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding rooms for rent in Washington DC</h2>



<p>In 1791, President Washington commissioned Pierre Charles L&#8217;Enfant, a French-born architect and city planner, to design the new capital. The L&#8217;Enfant Plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.</p>



<p>So naturally, neighborhoods in Washington, D.C., are distinguished by their history, culture, architecture, demographics, and geography. There are a total of 131 neighborhoods in the city.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top neighborhoods in Washington, DC</h2>

Apart from that, it has a community garden, parks, and easy commute to the city with the Metro Red Line.</li><li><strong>Georgetown:</strong> Home of the Georgetown university and filled with historical sites, this one doubles up as a shopper&#8217;s haven! And of course, there&#8217;s a park: The Georgetown Waterfront Park!</li><li><strong>Foggy Bottom:</strong> Quite contrary to its name, Foggy bottom is one of the safest neighborhoods to find rooms for rent in Washington DC.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Named after Saint Francis Assisi by Spanish colonizers, San Francisco city and county is a major cultural, commercial and financial center in Northern California, as well as the 16th most populous city in the U.S. Also the seventh richest county in the U.S., it was ranked 12th in the world and second in the United States on the Global Financial Centres Index as of March 2021, after New York City. And if you&#8217;re on the hunt for rooms for rent in San Francisco, it makes sense to get to know the city through and through. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for! Let&#8217;s get right to it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know San Francisco</h2>



<p>The riches of San Francisco can be dated back to 1849, when the California gold rush brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. Exactly as it sounds, the gold rush was the sudden discovery of gold in California that brought lakhs of new people into California, also inevitably declining the native Californian population as a result.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1521464302861-ce943915d1c3?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1051&amp;q=80" alt="Golden Gate bridge, San Francisco "/></figure>



<p>After destruction due to natural causes, and the consequent rebuilding of the city, and after playing a major role in the World War 2, it became the birthplace of the UN in 1945. After the war, the confluence of returning servicemen, immigration, along with the rise of countercultures, like the Sexual Revolution and the Peace Movement led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer of Love</a> and the gay rights movement, making San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States. So if you&#8217;re looking for rooms for rent in San Francisco, you know it&#8217;s a pretty cool place to be in.</p>



<p>San Francisco is mainly known for its cool summers, fog, steep rolling hills, eclectic mix of architecture, and landmarks. Moreover, San Francisco has several nicknames, including The City by the Bay, Golden Gate City, SF, San Fran, and Fog City, or as locals call it, &#8216;The City&#8217;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding rooms for rent in San Francisco</h2>



<p>There are five broad districts in San Francisco, namely, Central/downtown, Richmond, Sunset, Upper Market and beyond (south central) and Bernal Heights/Bayview and beyond (southeast). Within each of these five districts are located major neighborhoods of the city where you can find 1 bedroom or rooms for rent in San Francisco.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1471306224500-6d0d218be372?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=634&amp;q=80" alt="beverly hills in san francisco "/></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Walkability </h3>



<p>If you like walking, you&#8217;ll like San Francisco. Pedestrian traffic is quite widespread here. It has been ranked as the second-most walkable city in the United States, after <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/8-fascinating-documentaries-about-new-york-roomi/">New York</a>, of course. Moreover, In 2014, San Francisco committed to Vision Zero, with the goal of ending all traffic fatalities caused by motor vehicles at dangerous intersections within the city by 2024.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Trains </h3>



<p>The railway system in San Francisco is extensive, to say the least. It includes one heavy rail/commuter rail system, one commuter rail line, two light rail systems, and an Amtrak inter-city rail service.</p>



<p>The Bay Area Rapid Transit or <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> provides the major subway services in the area. Then there&#8217;s Caltrain, which provides commuter rail service on the San Francisco Peninsula, linking the cities of San Francisco, San Jose, Gilroy, and numerous peninsula cities in between.</p>



<p>Additionally, Millbrae Intermodal Terminal provides transfers between Caltrain and BART. And this is just one of the many rail methods available for the public.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Buses </h3>



<p>The&nbsp;Transbay Terminal&nbsp;serves as the terminus for long-range bus services and as a hub for regional bus systems.</p>



<p>Moreover,&nbsp;San Francisco riders can choose from three routes (SF-San Jose-LA, SF-Oakland-LA, &amp; SF-Sacramento-Reno) for using the Megabus. Other intercity bus services include&nbsp;California Shuttle Bus,&nbsp;Hoang Transportation, and&nbsp;USAsia.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Cycling </h3>



<p>Bay Wheels serves as the regional bicycle sharing system for the public. The bicycles are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to anyone who purchases a membership. Additionally, bikes can be picked up at any of the stations using a key fob or electronic code, and dropping them off at any station.</p>



<p>You can also find dockless bike sharing and scooter sharing services in San Francisco, meaning you can drop the bikes freely on the street when you&#8217;re done using them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Ferries </h3>



<p>There are multiple public and private ferry services, such as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=golden+gate+ferry&amp;oq=golden+gate+ferry&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j46i175i199j0l6j46i175i199j0.4320j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Gate Ferry</a> and the <a href="https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">San Francisco Bay Ferry</a> services. Most of the larger agencies accept the Clipper Card (a reloadable contactless smart card) as a universal electronic payment system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cultural activities in San Francisco</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://fortmason.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fort Mason Center for Arts &amp; Culture</a></h3>



<p>A 13-acre complex of former military buildings, transformed into a beautiful venue for art, it is one of the more prominent cultural hubs in San Francisco. It has concerts, theater performances, exhibitions, culinary events, and more all year round.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.calacademy.org/">California Academy of Sciences</a></h3>



<p>One of the world&#8217;s largest natural history museums, it includes a planetarium, enclosed rainforest exhibit, and the Steinhart Aquarium. Yes, all of that! So if you&#8217;re a natural science lover, make this your go to place!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.act-sf.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Conservatory Theater</a></h3>



<p>Love performance art? Then this one&#8217;s for you! A non-profit theater company, founded in 1965, it hosts both classical and contemporary performances across two venues. The performances are very high in quality, owing to the theater also being a reputable acting school.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546637078-41f947bab5a7?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1473&amp;q=80" alt="a man playing music on the streets of San Francisco "/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Historical spots in San Francisco</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fort Point</h3>



<p>We know you&#8217;re not going to miss the Golden Gate bridge, so when you do head there, check out Fort point. Located at the foot of the Golden Gate bridge and originally built to protect the Bay from naval attacks, it is truly one of its kind in the west.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Cable Car Museum</h3>



<p>Watch the engines and winding wheels pulling the cables and how they work. Learn about tracks, grips and brakes. And then of course, take a ride and enjoy the view!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Cliff House</h3>



<p>This one&#8217;s a must visit during the day time for the panoramic ocean views, martinis, oysters, and more! Don&#8217;t forget to take a look at the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/camera-obscura-holograph" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">camera obscura</a> while you&#8217;re there! Fun fact: The Camera was nearly shut down twice. But public support has kept it open, and in 2001 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and saved from destruction. So there&#8217;s no missing out on this one!</p>

<p>As the epicenter of America and the largest city in the country, Chicago is also known as &#8220;The Windy City&#8221;. What are the advantages of moving to Chicago? If you are considering moving to America, Chicago has everything you are searching for. If there are any lists of things in the country, region, or even world that claim to be the &#8220;biggest,&#8221; &#8220;tallest&#8221;, or &#8220;first&#8221;, chances are, Chicago is on it. Probably several times. But before we begin talking about finding rooms for rent in Chicago, letâs tell you a little bit about this big city.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Chicago</h2>



<p>Standing bold and tall on <strong><a href="https://www.michigan.org/great-lakes/lake-michigan" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Lake Michigan</a></strong>âs southwestern shoreline, Chicago is anything but timid. Big businesses, a strong passion for sports, and beautiful architecture are a part of Chicago&#8217;s reputation for being a city that justly takes pride in everything it does. A two-hour flight from Colorado and New York gets you to Chicago which is in the center of the United States.</p>



<p>Another trademark of the Windy City, however, is its diversity. Chicago has the energy of cities like New York and Boston as well as the heartiness of the Midwest, with its blend of cultures existing side by side in the bustling metropolis. After all, it is described as &#8220;The City of Big Shoulders&#8221; and &#8220;The City That Works&#8221; with good reason. The city boasts of the country&#8217;s oldest zoo, the <strong><a href="https://www.architecture.org/news/evolving-chicago/chicagos-ferris-wheel-story/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">world&#8217;s first Ferris wheel</a></strong>, and one of the largest municipal libraries in the world as well as the largest collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding rooms for rent in Chicago</h2>



<p>Even the frugal can find Chicago&#8217;s cost of living high. A large part of this can be attributed to the high 10.25% combined state and local sales taxes, as well as the second-highest property taxes in the United States.</p>



<p>An individual&#8217;s monthly costs, excluding rent or mortgage payments, average $929 and a family&#8217;s monthly costs average around $3,400.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, you can still get neighborhoods with affordable apartments in Chicago</p>

<p>In Chicago, having a personal vehicle is not necessary for navigating life. It is also extremely expensive to park in garages and on the streets, but if you need a set of wheels, however, you can find rental agencies closest to one of the many rooms for rent in Chicago, especially close to the airports. There are several other ways to travel throughout the large city.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Walkability</h3>



<p>Chicago is too big to explore on two feet, unless you are merely strolling around your neighborhood.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Roads/Traffic</h3>



<p>The layout of the city is grid-like, making it easy to navigate. But you must be aware of very limited (and often costly) parking during rush hour and heavy traffic. A number of websites and apps, including <strong><a href="http://spothero.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpotHero</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://parkchicago.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ParkChicago</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://parkchicago.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ParkWhiz</a></strong>, give you the opportunity to reserve spots and pay in advance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Taxis</h3>



<p>The <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://yellowcabchicago.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellow Cab Chicago</a></strong> is a convenient (though pricey) way to get to areas outside the downtown district. It may be more affordable to use a ride-hailing service, such as Uber or Lyft.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Public transportation</h3>



<p>More than 130 bus routes are run by the <strong><a href="https://www.transitchicago.com/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Chicago Transit Authority</a></strong>. They include express routes during rush hours, and they serve Chicago&#8217;s top sites, including many of the city&#8217;s top attractions. Several routes are available 24 hours a day.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Airports</h3>



<p>Chicago is home to two international airports that are located in the heart of the city. These airports serve over 240 destinations with thousands of international flights daily. They are: <strong><a href="https://www.flychicago.com/ohare/home/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Chicago O&#8217; Hare International Airport</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.flychicago.com/midway/home/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Chicago Midway International Airport</a></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">Cycle Friendly</h3>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/">Divvy</a></strong>, the city&#8217;s bicycle sharing service, allows you to borrow a pair of wheels whenever you need them. Divvy day passes are offered for $15; single rides are $3.</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/is-it-time-for-you-to-move-to-another-city/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is It Time For You To Move To Another City</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Weather in Chicago</h2>



<p>There is a joke among Chicagoans that there are only two seasons, summer and winter, and it can certainly feel like that especially if you just moved into one of the apartments in Chicago. With temperatures dropping abruptly in mid-October, and no evidence of warming until nearly May, a heavy coat is a necessity at Halloween, and snow boots at Easter are not unusual. The winters in Chicago can be brutally cold with wind chills as low as below 40, while the hot summers in Chicago are delightful, generally in the low to mid-80s, with the famous Chicago breeze removing the humidity from the air.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cultural activities in Chicago</h2>



<p>There are thousands of free events, activities, and attractions in the city. The Art Institute and the Shedd Aquarium offer free admission on designated days. Lincoln Park Zoo, Garfield Park Conservatory, National Museum of Mexican Art, and Cultural Center are always free. The Park District organizes free events such as movies, theatrical productions, plays, circuses, yoga classes, and nature walks.</p>
