<p>They say the best kinds of friendships stick with you when life goes high, low and sideways. One of the most memorable (&amp; platonic) coliving couples on screen are Monica and Rachel from Friends. They take one another through break ups, unemployment, weddings and even babies! In displaying their unwavering support for one another, they created ultimate #friendlshipgoals for everyone who ever has to share an apartment, living in NYC or elsewhere.</p>



<p>We took a little trip down memory lane, watched some of our favorite Monica-Rachel episodes (only for research, we swear!), and came up with five incredible lessons in friendship and co-living in NYC.</p>



<p><em>Psst if you want a little trip down memory lane, </em><a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/tv/friends" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a><em> to learn where you can revisit your favorite episodes!</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You could find your coliving soulmate anywhere, at any moment!</h2>

<p>Have you been worrying, wondering, and fervently browsing coliving apps to find the perfect roommate? Relax. At Roomi, we’ve seen that there is someone out there for everyone. Often, people find that special roomie to share an apartment within a snap. But at other times, it can take a minute. Hang in there.</p>



<p>Remember how Rachel waltzed into Monica’s life? She was soaking wet, still in her wedding dress, and run away from a wedding full of her own guests. Strange things happen. And we wish you as strange a meeting with your roommate so you’ll have a story to tell your grandkids!</p>



<p><em>You may want to check this out: <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/benefits-conveniences-roommate-finder-app/253/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Benefits And Conveniences Of A Roommate Finder App</a></em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Support your roommate, even if the idea is a little out there</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:75%">

	</div>
	


<p>When you share an apartment, you’ll see that there are many different sides to a person. Not everyone is all good or all bad. All the best ones are always a little bit nuts. Every now and then, getting out of your comfort zone and trying a strange idea is a great way to bond with your coliving companion.</p>



<p>Whether it’s throwing an impromptu dress-up party, playing a game of twister or even, hosting two birthday parties because your roommate has parents who don’t get along!</p>



<p>Related: For when it&#8217;s safe for you to go out: <a href="https://ny.eater.com/maps/best-cafe-coffee-shop-new-york-city-brooklyn-queens" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outstanding Coffeeshops to Visit in New York City</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of each kind can make a fine pair</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:83%">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Remember how everyone always hung out at Monica’s apartment? It’s probably because her fridge was always stocked, pillows always fluffed and her place was always neat! Everything has a place and everything is in its place.</p>



<p>However, only Rachel could actually put up with Monica’s drive to organize and clean. Whether you’re living in NYC or anywhere else, your coliving partner needs to complement your vibe. Like Rachel’s laidback attitude to cleaning and Monia’s compulsion for it. They worked like salt and pepper, like peanut butter and jelly, or breakfast for dinner. You wouldn’t think that they would work, but they just do.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sometimes you need tough love</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Living in NYC is expensive, even if you share an apartment and the rent that goes with it. But once a New Yorker, always a New Yorker, amirite? Surviving this city needs a bit of grit.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need a person who channels a little bit of Monica to give you the push you need. Remember how she got Rachel to cut up all her credit cards? Happily, Rachel went on to find a job, a dream, and eventually lived her dream working at Ralph Lauren. A little bit of tough love can go a long way!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">She’ll always be there for you, even if it’s not your day, week, month or even your year!</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

<p>2020 truly put roommate pairs to the test, didn’t it? From lockdowns, erratic work schedules, and the looming threat of the pandemic— it threw one obstacle after another at all of us living in NYC.</p>



<p>The best part about finding a friend in a coliving partner is that you get to have someone who’s got your back. It may take a little time to meet the right person to share an apartment with but when you do, you can even find family.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stories are often told of two strangers living together and becoming the best of friends. It is said becoming roommates with friends should be avoided to keep what they have. But let&#8217;s take a closer look at this strange phenomena to decide. Should you be moving in with your friend? There are three sides to every situation. Let&#8217;s consider the good, bad, and reality of living with a friend.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b><strong>Pros</strong></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> of moving in with your friend </strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No roommate hunt, no awkward first meetings, no roommate interviews. Friends, for the most part, know each other. You understand your friends habits already and you may have experience <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-resolve-conflicts-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resolving conflicts</a> with each other. Living with a friend can reduce stress exponentially. You always have someone near who not only knows you, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you. There comes a time among roommates where you need favors, or to borrow almond milk until you can make it to the store. Moving in with your friend makes the asking part that much easier. Living with a friend is comfortable and makes it twice as easy to maintain your traditional nights of Chinese takeout and Netflix originals. What is better than spring rolls and House of Cards&#8230;right?</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>Cons </b>of moving in with your friend</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, how the truest of colors will shine when moving in with your friend! Three weeks into your new lifestyle living with a friend, you wake up realizing it&#8217;s not just the world&#8217;s longest sleepover. <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/matthew-vega/2015/01/5-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-move-in-with-your-best-friend/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facing issues with a friend</a> that you live with can be intimidating. You walk the fine line of commitment over conflict. With a typical roommate, confrontation can be a lot easier to face. After all, you’re not too concerned if a stranger likes you or not. With a friend, it can be tempting to withhold communication around an issue because you don’t want to be another failed attempt at being roommates with a friend. But you’ve watched your leftovers disappear one too many times, and things aren’t looking so good anymore.</span></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><b>The rea</b>lity of living with a friend</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality of moving with your friend is you’ll be fine. You friendship will grow in some areas and perhaps suffer in others. It’s 12 months and anything is manageable for a year. At the very worst the friendship ends when the lease expires, and should that be the case maybe it wasn’t the strongest of bonds anyway. But when you become roommates with your friends, you’ll most likely just pick up each other’s weird habits and have new found appreciation for one another.</span></p>
