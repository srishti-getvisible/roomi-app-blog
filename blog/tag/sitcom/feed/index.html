										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If there&#8217;s one thing that can turn your daily life into a living hell, it&#8217;s cohabitation with an OCD roommate. Now, Paris Geller wasn&#8217;t exactly diagnosed with OCD or obsessive-compulsive disorder. But she was the perfect example of a crazy roommate, assuming prefect-like authority to enforce rules. When your roommate is a control freak, you may feel your boundaries encroached upon. You might also feel any move you make might be taken against you. Rory Gilmore and Paris were rivals turned frenemies in high school, which made things even more complicated when they went to college. Living with a roommate like her? Here&#8217;s how you can deal with an OCD roommate, based on Rory and Paris&#8217;s story.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Embrace the unexpected.</h2>

<p>When you&#8217;re living with an OCD roommate, expect a lot of surprises each day. Like, for starters, them popping up and announcing themselves as your roommate. When Paris doesn&#8217;t get into Harvard, she shows up unexpectedly at Rory&#8217;s college dorm at Yale. She brings her life coach, who advises her to &#8220;complete her life journey&#8221; by enrolling in the same school. Paris&#8217;s life coach also tells her to take up crafts as keeping her hands busy minimizes her emotional outbursts. Rory and Paris living together definitely made their college lives super interesting.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can cope with the little annoyances, now. The old Paris would&#8217;ve been bothered by your penchant hover. It would&#8217;ve made her wanna wring your neck &#8217;til your eyeballs popped out. But now, I accept it because I can&#8217;t control everything.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Let her have her way.</h2>

<p>The last thing you want to do when living with an OCD roommate is get in her way. When your roommate is a control freak, it&#8217;s best to just let her do what she wants to do.</p>



<p>Paris is so annoyed with their roommate Janet—who has a partial athletics scholarship—that she occasionally calls for &#8220;roommate meetings.&#8221; The huddles are meant for the roomies to &#8220;air their grievances&#8221; and to &#8220;resolve them.&#8221; Rory and Paris, along with their roommates Tanna and Janet, meet together in the living room for these pow-wows. But settling differences, it turns out, is not on the agenda!</p>



<p>Paris says to Janet: &#8220;Setting your alarm for 5:30 in the morning when no one else here shares the desire to put on nylon shorts and run in circles for an hour like a greyhound is selfish.&#8221;</p>



<p>Janet for sure thinks Paris is a crazy roommate. Paris even picks on Janet&#8217;s boyfriend, Andre, for his bulky physique.</p>



<p>When someone writes &#8220;DIE JERK&#8221; on their door, Paris calls for yet another roommate meeting. She concludes that they could identify the perpetrator by listing down their enemies&#8217; names. Paris narrows down her list from 26 to five.</p>



<p>One afternoon, Rory&#8217;s grandfather, Richard, shows up at Yale and has lunch with them. He tells Rory and Paris about the time he and his friends tied up their roommate each day for a month and would toss him out the window.</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;I&#8217;m writing that down.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Deal with her quirky interests.</h2>

<p>Living with a roommate means being around to witness each other&#8217;s highs and lows. Paris, being the OCD roommate that she is, had peculiar ways of channeling her emotions.</p>



<p>When Paris loses her lover—the elderly Yale professor Asher Fleming—to a heart attack, she&#8217;s wrought with grief. In his memory, she brings into their dorm a massive 18th-century printing press that Asher left her. Rory and Paris end up in a mini-argument because of the monstrosity.</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;It&#8217;s on my book bag! I&#8217;m late for class and you put a printing press on my bookbag.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;Well, sorry, it&#8217;s from my dead boyfriend, okay? I apologize if my grief is inconveniencing you. Maybe I&#8217;ll just put myself on an iceberg and float myself out to sea so that no one will have to deal with my suffering.&#8221;</p>



<p>Later on in the series, Paris eventually moves on and falls in love with Doyle, the editor of the <em>Yale Daily News</em>. For some reason, they endure a long-lasting relationship because Doyle can tolerate Paris&#8217;s hostility, type A personality, and explosive episodes. Some of their strange bonding activities include Krav Maga and partner yoga. Rory&#8217;s mom, Lorelai, must think Paris is quite the crazy roommate with an equally quirky boyfriend.</p>



<p>Paris to Rory, about Doyle: &#8220;You know, he calls me his girlfriend, now, with no visible shaking.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Don&#8217;t take her competitiveness too seriously.</h2>

<p>Time and time again, Rory finds herself facing Paris&#8217;s wrath whenever she naturally outshines her. Let&#8217;s not forget that Rory and Paris were each other&#8217;s biggest competition in high school. So whenever Paris is better than Rory at something, Rory just shrugs it off. But boy, Paris sure knows how to rub Rory&#8217;s weaknesses in her face. Thankfully, Rory exhibits amazing patience while living with a roommate like Paris.</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;Paris, please don&#8217;t compare our reading speeds again. You&#8217;re fast, I&#8217;m slow, go enjoy your trophy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;I need the exact time of today&#8217;s sunset.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;I&#8217;m in the middle of an article.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;If you read faster, you wouldn&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>



<p>Towards the end of their senior year, Paris knows she can count on Rory for their final push before graduating. She literally has like five whiteboards filled with charts and to-dos. She has one for academics, career ops, and job fairs. Paris even schedules weekly report-back sessions, revealing herself as such an OCD roommate. This is typical behavior when your roommate is a control freak.</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;This is the game plan for what I call &#8216;Operation Finish Line.&#8217; We only have five months left before we leave the warm and comforting bosom of this university and face the bitterly cold shoulder of the real world.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;We?&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;You&#8217;re the green marker. Green was a random choice, not a subtle comment about how inexperienced you are with real-life matters. Then again, maybe it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rory knows more than anyone that Paris is a real softie inside. Growing up with a &#8220;half-Viking&#8221; mom, no wonder Paris became such an OCD roommate. She&#8217;s abrasive but loses her tough exterior when she&#8217;s treated with kindness. Rory and Paris develop such a bond on the show that fans even linked the two of them romantically.</p>



<p>During the show, Paris and Doyle break up twice. The first time it happens, Paris sulks and blares music from a 1960s video where people dance. Despite looking obviously bothered by the noise, Rory just leaves Paris to do what she wants.</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;Every one of these people is dead. It makes me sad.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;That movie&#8217;s from the 60s. They&#8217;re not all dead.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;Well, they&#8217;re old. Osteoporosis these days, if they shake it, they break it. That makes me sad.&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris is accepted to all the law and medical schools she applies for. Because she&#8217;s anxious about deciding whether to take up law or medicine, she snaps.</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Rory: &#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>Paris: &#8220;Your noticeable drop of enthusiasm? Is that an expression of the fact that you&#8217;re less impressed by my admission into the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine than my other acceptances?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rory and Paris might not have a conventional friendship, but it&#8217;s one that pushes them both to excel in whatever they do. Sure, an OCD roommate might not be ideal for everyone, but in their case, it works because of their strong bond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today&#8217;s world where co-parenting is no longer restricted to the conventional &#8220;mom and dad&#8221; arrangement, we can all learn a thing or two from setups that veer away from the norm.</p>



<p>Case in point: two popular sitcom parents, Charlie and Alan Harper from <em>Two And a Half Men</em>. The show&#8217;s about living with a sibling, living in LA, and raising a kid together, while being worlds apart in terms of personality. Charlie and Alan may not exactly make the best pairing, but hey, they manage to do the job in raising Alan&#8217;s ten-year-old son, Jake.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re raising a child with someone, whether it&#8217;s with a spouse, a friend, or a relative, you&#8217;d be surprised at how much you can learn from these fictional characters. Here are some off-the-beaten-path and strangely effective co-parenting tips we can all learn from Charlie and Alan.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Grocery shopping doubles as bonding time</h2>

<p>Who says you can&#8217;t let your kid tag along on your errands? It&#8217;s safe to say that when a child has fun spending time with you, it&#8217;s proof of some effective co-parenting skills. Because Alan&#8217;s a busy chiropractor and Charlie&#8217;s a commercial jingle composer who gets to spend most of his days at his beautiful Malibu beachside house, Charlie gets to spend more time with Jake. One of their activities together is going grocery shopping, and while catching the eye of the ladies and picking out Jake&#8217;s preferred brand of milk, they even discover their shared love for jingles. Remember when Jake grabbed a box of cereal and they sang the Mapleicious song (which Charlie composed, of course)?</p>



<p>Jake: &#8220;I want Maple Loops. It&#8217;s got corn and oats and wheat, it&#8217;s the sweetest breakfast treat!&#8221;</p>



<p>Charlie and Jake, in unison: &#8220;It&#8217;s Maple, Maple, Maaaaapleicious!&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Use metaphors when introducing adult concepts</h2>

<p>Alan and Jake move in with Charlie—who&#8217;s living in LA—when Alan splits up with his wife, Judith. Charlie, by default, needs to brush up on his uncle game with his nephew now living under the same roof and seeing almost everything he does. Being the stereotypical serial dating bachelor, Charlie sometimes needs to introduce touchy adult concepts to Jake.</p>



<p>In one episode, Jake tells Charlie he feels obliged to like a girl back, after she gave him a cupcake. Now, being the kind of man he is, Charlie proceeded to school Jake with a cupcake metaphor, saying, &#8220;Never, ever confuse cupcakes with love.&#8221; Basically, Charlie was telling Jake that he should be able to enjoy &#8220;cupcakes&#8221; without getting emotionally involved. Well, the show&#8217;s not called <em>Two And A Half Men</em> for nothing, deriving its humor from sexist jokes.</p>



<p>Charlie and Alan end up getting into an argument because Charlie was low-key teaching Jake about casual sex. While not everyone will agree that the cupcake metaphor was the right tool to use at that moment, you still get the point that metaphors can help when teaching kids stuff during their adolescence. Conflicting parenting opinions can be a struggle when living with a sibling, but it&#8217;s good to encourage a child to have more than one perspective.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Let the kid experiment and make mistakes</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:75%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/wKv0c7ozj3UZy" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/wKv0c7ozj3UZy/giphy.gif"></iframe>

	</div>
	


<p>Charlie and Alan are by no means super strict parents, and one of the co-parenting tips we learn from them is that it&#8217;s okay to let a kid have fun while trying to learn different things. One time, they even let Jake try an adult activity (with proper supervision, of course).</p>



<p>In one episode, they teach Jake basic driving skills and he ends up almost hitting trash bins in a parking lot. (One of the perks of living with a sibling, probably, is letting them take some of the blame if anything happens to the kid). Whether it&#8217;s blitzing cereal and fruit in a blender, buying a broken motorcycle with all his money, or &#8220;snorkeling&#8221; in a sink filled with water, at least Jake knows it&#8217;s okay to experiment, make mistakes, and sometimes make a mess. As long as he cleans up afterward, of course. Effective co-parenting skills? We&#8217;ll let you be the judge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Welcome the child&#8217;s choices</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">
		<figure>
							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3ohs7Q2EEizyOslmIE" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohs7Q2EEizyOslmIE/giphy.gif"></iframe>
				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>When Alan and Judith suggest Jake audition for a school musical, his Uncle Charlie steps in and helps him pick out a song to rehearse. Never one to follow the crowd, Jake says he wants to perform Queen&#8217;s &#8220;Bohemian Rhapsody.&#8221; Although Jake—who ends up getting the lead role because his dad had a fling with his teacher—doesn&#8217;t necessarily have a golden set of pipes, Charlie and Alan try their best to help him get ready. Effective co-parenting skills mean helping build a child&#8217;s self-confidence, after all.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Integrate school lessons into everyday situations</h2>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

							<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif-wrapper" style="padding-top:56%">
					<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3d74FduNTv5Lmm4TG4" title="https://media.giphy.com/media/3d74FduNTv5Lmm4TG4/giphy.gif"></iframe>

	</div>
	


<p>When Jake enters his teens, he starts hanging out more with his dad and uncle. While chilling at a coffee shop, Jake happens to notice a lady he finds &#8220;hot&#8221; and tells them she&#8217;s &#8220;at 12 o&#8217;clock.&#8221; The thing is, he used the current time on his watch instead of approximating the position of the woman using a mental clock face. LOL. Charlie and Alan use the moment as an opportunity to correct Jake &#8211; until they bump into their mom and her new boyfriend, that is. Living in LA, we&#8217;re guessing it&#8217;s pretty common to stumble into someone you know.</p>



<p>We hope we&#8217;ve not only taken you on a trip down <em>Two And A Half Men</em> memory lane and helped you relive those hilarious Charlie and Alan moments, but also given you some oddball co-parenting tips to guide you as you raise a child or teen. Good luck!</p>

<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-pasadena/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Living in Pasadena</a>, the characters of the Big Bang Theory entertain and delight us with their quirky humor and eccentric friendships. But as well as that, the Big Bang Theory also shows the fun side of being friends and roommates, living with a difficult person (like Sheldon), and yet loving them for who they are (like Leonard does.)</p>



<p>So, here are some top living advice inspired by the legendary Leonard and Sheldon, and tips for how you can apply their roommate rules to make co-living easier, and much more fun.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Sheldon must ask how Leonard is.</h2>

<p>This needs to be the norm in your (unspecified) roommate rules, especially in times like these. We&#8217;re all fighting big battles by ourselves and it seems like everyone has so much going on, that we can&#8217;t even fully care for ourselves, let alone anyone else.</p>



<p>So, make it a habit to regularly check on the people you live with and <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/spotting-telltale-signs-of-anxiety-in-your-roommate-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ask how they&#8217;re feeling</a>. Be like Leonard and Sheldon and no matter how much you get onto each other&#8217;s nerves, push that aside, and take care of each other.</p>

<p>Well, yes! Okay, maybe not 12 hours (we know that&#8217;s just Sheldon being Sheldon.) But giving your roommate a quick heads up about guests coming to stay, is common courtesy and should be included in your roommate rules. Trust us, this is key living advice for maintaining a healthy friendship.</p>



<p>And now, with the pandemic in our lives, instead of just informing them, it&#8217;s good practice to make sure they&#8217;re okay with having people over. If they&#8217;re not, you can come up with a solution together.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Any changes in furnishings have to be approved by the furnishing committee which meets on alternate years on his spot.</h2>

<p>Being stuck at home, most people want to clean, rearrange and do things to make the place feel less drab and make themselves feel better. And that&#8217;s completely understandable. But, you need to keep the people you live within the loop and as such, this clause should be in the roommate rules!</p>



<p>If you decide to do some rearrangements, have a discussion about what is okay, and what is not first. Rearranging the living room might be okay, but rearranging their bedroom probably isn&#8217;t!</p>

<p>Now, we&#8217;re sure no roommate will be as harsh as Sheldon and that cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys do not exist (yet.)</p>



<p>But if you&#8217;re living with someone who IS as stubborn as Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory and they do not want to share their home with animals, our best living advice is to look for new humans to live with. That way, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/should-i-adopt-a-pet-in-the-midst-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can have pets</a> other than seeing-eye dogs and soft kitties.</p>



<p>However, for all kinds of co-living relationships, there definitely needs to be a pet clause. Some people might be allergic to pets, while others might be terrified of certain species. And maybe that someone is you! Discuss everything upfront, so all parties know that they&#8217;ve made a good choice.</p>

All this begins to change when a free-spirited beauty named Penny (Kaley Cuoco, pictured middle) moves in next door.  Sheldon, Leonard&#039;s roommate, is quite content spending his nights playing Klingon Boggle with their socially dysfunctional friends, fellow Cal Tech scientists Wolowitz (Simon Helberg, pictured far left) and Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar, pictured far right).  However, Leonard sees in Penny a whole new universe of possibilities... including love. THE BIG BANG THEORY premiers on Mon., Sept. 24 (8:30-9:00 PM, ET\/PT).

<p>YES! Well, if not a 60 day comment period, a 60 minute comment period maybe? If you usually order from one specific place and want to switch things up, make sure everyone&#8217;s okay with it before you do. Make sure no one sits sulking, playing with their food while the rest tuck in. This living advice goes a long way. Trust us, you don&#8217;t want anyone in your home to get &#8216;hangry.&#8217;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Section 37B: provide a &#8220;confirmation sniff&#8221; to tell if questionable dairy products are edible</h3>



<p>Think about it this way. If you break such roommate rules, the bathroom may well be blocked up by someone whose food didn&#8217;t agree with them, all because YOU didn&#8217;t follow the rule. Let that sink in. (Pun intended)</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t we all have to? Seriously though. If you&#8217;re entering a co-living relationship, like in any other relationship, be ready to accept your roommate for who they are, with all their &#8216;crazies&#8217; and BAZINGAs included!</p>

<p>Last but not least, you don&#8217;t have to be best buddies with your roommate if that&#8217;s not your cup of tea. As long as all parties are okay just being people living together, this can work well. Feel free to have an open conversation and get it all out of the way before signing an agreement.</p>



<p>As long as everyone is good at paying rent, sharing utilities, and generally being civil with one another, it should work just fine. The point is, don&#8217;t force friendship on the people you co-live with.</p>



<p>And if you are friends, be super grateful for them. Because that is just precious.</p>



<p>Now we&#8217;ve cleared that up, we&#8217;re going to go back to watching The Big Bang Theory, for research purposes &#8211; obviously!</p>
