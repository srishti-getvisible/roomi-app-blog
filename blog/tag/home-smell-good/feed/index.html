<p>When we&#8217;re all stuck indoors most of the time, it&#8217;s tough to say <strong><em>smell you later</em></strong> to our apartment. And keeping the windows open all the time could let the uninvited roomis &#8211; <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-diy-pest-control-measures-for-your-home-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the pests</a> &#8211; in! So, how do we make our home smell good naturally? Do homemade air freshener recipes even exist?!</p>



<p>Because most air fresheners smell so much like chemicals, you don&#8217;t want anything to do with them. Some research says some of them <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-safety/air-freshener-dangers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be harmful</a> to you, your pets, and plants as well.</p>



<p>A naturally good smelling apartment however, can positively affect our health.</p>



<p>Think about the difference in your mood when you walk past a garbage stink v/s when you walk under a tree full of fragrant flowers.</p>



<p><em>Many ancient civilizations, including Egypt, China, and India, have used aromatherapy as a popular complementary and alternative therapy for more than thousands of years. In traditional medicine as well as in aromatherapy and herbal medicine, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198031/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">essential oils and fragrance compounds</a> have been used for the treatments of various psychological and physical disorders such as headaches, pain, insomnia, eczema, stress-induced anxiety, depression, and digestive problems.</em></p>



<p>So now, when you feel you&#8217;re running out of things to make yourself feel good at home, invest some time and a minimal amount of money to spread the beauty of natural fragrances in your home. (No, the smell of pizza doesn&#8217;t count.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Make your home smell good naturally with kitchen ingredients!</h2>



<p>Want to make your house smell great, but don&#8217;t wish to shop for it? We have good news for you! You can use stuff you already have at home &#8211; especially the ingredients you love to sniff before chopping up and cooking. Take citrus &#8211; like lemons or oranges, add whichever herbs, berries, cinnamon sticks, and other goody-goody smelling ingredients you like, and add it to a pot of water.</p>



<p>Bring the pot to a boil and simmer for as long as you like. When it&#8217;s done, the sweet aroma will fill your kitchen, making your home smell good.</p>



<p><em><strong>Tip</strong>: Once you take the pot off of the stove, put it in a microwaveable jar, and heat it whenever you need to bring in the sweet fragrance that makes your apartment smell good.</em></p>
