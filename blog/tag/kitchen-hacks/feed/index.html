										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Finding your dream home is no joke. Believe us, we know. Renting an apartment that fits all your needs also seems like one of those desires that only come true with an &#8220;almost&#8221; as a prefix. But the worst part? realizing that the place that looked so good in the online listing is not so great in real life can be discouraging. That’s why it is important to set realistic goals. Some of the most common questions that arise when people are trying to find the right apartment for them to rent, especially in cities like <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York</a></strong>, <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Miami</a></strong>, <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/rooms-for-rent-in-austin-tx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Austin</a></strong>, are questions pertaining to the smaller details. Perhaps you’ve even stumbled on countless occasions upon the term “kitchenette”. Sounds cute, right? What is a kitchenette? What is the difference between a kitchen and a kitchenette? When considering kitchen vs. kitchenette, which one is the best choice for you?</p>



<p>Well, let&#8217;s get into it!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kitchen-vs-kitchenette-what-really-is-the-difference-between-a-kitchen-and-a-kitchenette">Kitchen vs. kitchenette: What really is the difference between a kitchen and a kitchenette?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/98095330-6eed-432b-814c-b79c9f9b67c2/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="the difference between a kitchen and a kitchenette can be the size, as displayed in this picture"/></figure>



<p>So most people will have you believe that the only difference between a kitchen and a kitchenette is size. However, there are certain other characteristics that can help you decide the best option for you.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever come across an apartment that comes with a compact kitchen or combination kitchen, you&#8217;ve run into what one might call a kitchenette. A kitchen, on the other hand, is a room fully equipped with all the cooking facilities necessary. It’s where you prep and cook everything.</p>



<p>But turns out, size isn&#8217;t the only thing that helps us differentiate when considering a kitchen vs. kitchenette.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kitchen-vs-kitchenette-the-difference-in-the-room-for-customization">Kitchen vs. kitchenette: The difference in the room for customization.</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s an age-old practice to make houses that reflect the personality of the person who owns the house. You get to outfit it with all the features you like and you get to choose any style you prefer. Since the kitchen can vary in size, you get to customize it in whatever way you want.</p>



<p>In the case of a kitchenette, on the other hand, there’s not a lot of room for creativity and flexibility. There’s very little space to work with so the design usually has to be as practical as it can be. And as for the style, it just becomes a secondary priority.</p>



<p><strong>Related</strong>: <strong><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/sharing-a-kitchen-a-guide-to-peacefully-share-a-kitchen-with-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sharing a Kitchen: A Guide to Peacefully Share a Kitchen</a></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-s-a-difference-in-the-organization">There&#8217;s a difference in the organization!</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bfeb82ff-98ff-488c-ad40-65a9d6b190db/Untitled.png?w=1250&#038;ssl=1" alt="kitchen vs kitchenette can be determined though many varying factors like size, appliances and organizational space"/></figure>



<p>When comparing the difference between a kitchen and a kitchenette, you must also consider that a kitchen comes with better scope for organization, just because of the extra space that&#8217;s available. Kitchens can include a pantry and lots of storage space in general in the form of cabinets, shelves, etc.</p>



<p>A kitchenette, on the other hand, will be the perfect option for you if you&#8217;re a minimalist, enjoy having a small functional space, and need no more than practicality. This is also the reason why you&#8217;d see a bunch of basements and pool houses that come with kitchenettes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kitchen-vs-kitchenette-the-differences-in-appliances">Kitchen vs. kitchenette: The differences in appliances!</h3>



<p>With kitchenettes, you&#8217;ll have limited space to work with. This also means that you&#8217;ll have to stop yourself from going overboard with filling your kitchenette with appliances.</p>



<p>Full-size appliances are almost never a part of a kitchenette’s design. Usually, they include a microwave, a small fridge and freezer, and a hot plate. It’s enough to prepare a few quick and simple dishes, but if you want to impress with your cooking skills, this is not the place to do it. That said, if you’re looking for healthy and space-saving appliance options, a compact and <a href="https://www.hurom.com/products/h-aa-slow-juicer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quiet juicer</a> can be a smart addition—ideal for morning juice without disturbing roommates.</p>



<p>A standard kitchen, on the other hand, is almost always equipped with a stovetop, a sink, a dishwasher, microwave, refrigerator, and several other electric appliances. Even small kitchens get to include all these things. Built-in appliances are a great way to save space.</p>

<p>After a long day of work, the last thing any of us want to do is go slog in the kitchen for a half-decent meal. I mean cooking just involves so many steps. There’s the washing, the chopping, the actual cooking, and then if that’s not enough, there’s also the clean-up afterwards. So, it’s no surprise most of us end up getting DoorDash meals most work nights. But now those bills are adding up on your card and you’re wondering if there’s anyway to make cooking easier. Well, this is where Roomi comes in. We’ve got 5 great kitchen tricks for you that will change your life. Whether you’ve never stepped foot in a kitchen before, or you’re a professional chef, these kitchen hacks will appeal to all. So, sit back and watch us blow your mind with these amazing kitchen tips and hacks!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Easy ginger trick: One of the greatest kitchen hacks</h2>



<p>Ginger is something that most of us have in our pantry. They add so much flavor to food and have so much nutritional value. Not to mention, <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-ginger-tea-3377239" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">ginger tea</a> is one of God’s greatest creations and we stand by that. But for how delicious they are, they can be quite a pain in the ass. I mean, peeling ginger is one of the most annoying things on the planet. I mean, a ginger root has so many nooks and crannies that peeling it takes <em>forever</em>.</p>



<p>So, here’s one of our great kitchen tricks: Scrap the skin of the ginger with a spoon, don’t bother doing it with a knife. And wherever it gets too tough… leave the skin on. There’s no harm in consuming ginger skin, so why bother trying to get every bit of it off! Isn’t that so liberating?!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kitchen hacks for the soul: Peeling garlic</h2>



<p>If you’re like us, you want to put garlic on everything. I mean, why not? It’s one of the most delicious flavors on this planet. Honestly, we’ve never listened to recipes when they ask us to use 3 garlic cloves. It’s double or nothing for us! Which is what makes this trick one of the best kitchen tips in the world. Peeling garlic is the most boring part of cooking. So, what if we told you that you can actually peel up to 20 garlics in under 20 seconds? Sounds insane, right? But it really isn’t. Check out this video on how to do it. It truly is one of the best kitchen hacks! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Microwave your veggies</h2>



<p>This is one of our favorite kitchen tips/hacks ever! If you’ve ever tried to cook roasted potatoes on a Wednesday night, you’re keenly aware of how long it takes to cook them through. Cooking vegetables often takes a very long time, which can be very annoying when all you want is a quick and healthy meal. So in order to cut your cooking time in half, microwave your veggies first. Yes, it’s that easy! Place your veggies in a pot of water and then stick it in the microwave. You can do this with any vegetable that takes a bit long to cook on the stove. How long you need to microwave veggies for will vary based on the veggie and the strength of your microwave. Just make sure it&#8217;s soft when you cut into it. Yeah, it’s that easy!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of the easiest kitchen hacks: pre-cut veggies</h2>

And this is one of those great kitchen tricks that will finish off all the trouble that comes with cooking veggies. BUY PRE-CUT VEGGIES. It will absolutely change your life. Between these two kitchen tips, this one and the microwave one, you’re going to cut down your cooking time to under 10 minutes. Isn’t that amazing?!

But most of us don’t have the patience for it and that’s okay! So, what you can do is do a weekly meal prep. Cook maybe twice a week when your schedule is light and then eat those meals through the week. </p>

I mean, how many times have you stood in the middle of your kitchen and wondered what the hell you should cook for dinner? Well, meal prep takes care of that problem. Just cook your <a href="https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/how-to-meal-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meals</a> beforehand and then have a stress free week!</p>

<p>We all have days when we go into the kitchen to cook and spend hours there because things didn&#8217;t go the way we anticipated. That&#8217;s also partially the reason you dislike cooking. Don&#8217;t worry we&#8217;ve got you covered- you can bid goodbye to the days of kitchen distress as we have a list of ingenious kitchen hacks that will make you fall in love with cooking all over again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Who are you rooting for?</h2>



<p>Well, we are rooting for freezers as they are a great way to store fresh ginger esp. when you&#8217;re done grating it. Just freeze the leftover root in a plastic container to avoid stray shriveled ginger across your fridge.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Avoid cling wrap disasters!</h2>



<p>Have you had enough of annoying wrangling plastic wrap? Store the roll in the fridge as chilling the wrap reduces the stickiness. I&#8217;ve literally found myself tangled up in cling foil on many occasions. But thanks to this useful kitchen hack I am sorted for life! </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Make foamy milk without a frother at home! (#1 on ingenious kitchen hacks you didn&#8217;t think you needed, but do now)</h2>



<p>So what you don&#8217;t own a fancy-schmancy espresso machine with an attached milk steamer? Honestly, all you need is a small glass jar with a lid. Fill the jar halfway with milk and shake it off Taylor Swift style until the jar contents have doubled in size. Now pop in the microwave for 30 seconds to enjoy the frothy goodness. You&#8217;re welcome!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Save your brown sugar!</h2>



<p>Ugh, the worst: You go to make cookies, only to find your brown sugar has hardened beyond revival.</p>



<p>Use this useful kitchen hack to help your brown sugar stay soft &#8211; add orange peel or a slice of apple along with the sugar into an airtight container.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. This one will drive you nuts!</h2>



<p>Nuts are freezer-friendly, and you could freeze shelled nuts to preserve their natural oils and make them last longer. This is one of those kitchen hacks that will save your nuts throughout the year. Ok, I don&#8217;t think that came out right!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Goodbye ice cream freezer burns</h2>



<p>This is clearly the most annoying thing that could happen to anyone &#8211; you want to eat your ice cream, but the ice cream doesn&#8217;t want you to eat it. You can keep ice cream ready to eat by placing a piece of wax paper over it before putting it back in the freezer.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s worse than buying fresh herbs in bulk &#8211; to see them wilt and die the very next day. Store herbs like parsley &amp; cilantro properly with this cool storage tip! Trim the stems and place the herbs in a small glass of water. Cover the herbs with a plastic/grocery bag and secure by tying the plastic in a knot. Store in the fridge or on the counter for up to two weeks!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. When life gives you lemons</h2>



<p>Squeeze the maximum juice out of it by using this useful kitchen hack. To get the most juice out of a lemon, refrigerate, then microwave it for 15 to 20 seconds. Yep, this is definitely one of those hacks that will save you time and energy. Because nobody likes fussing over a lemon that doesn&#8217;t squeeze well!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Who&#8217;s a firefighter?</h2>



<p>You are! Accidents happen in the kitchen all the time. So you were doing a fancy flip and now your oil-soaked stir fry is on fire &#8211;&nbsp;<em>it happens!</em>&nbsp;Before you abandon the pan to save your life or call your roomi for help, try this hack. By no means add water to a fire caused by oil &#8211; it will only make it worse. Instead, sprinkle baking soda onto a small grease or electrical fire to extinguish the flames. When heated, baking soda releases carbon dioxide, which helps to kill the fire.</p>

<p>A small kitchen equals a messy kitchen &#8211; precariously placed dishes, scattered cutlery, and an unsteady mountain of essentials that some call the pantry. Not anymore &#8211; believe us, when we say there&#8217;s always enough space to store your snacks and ingredients. The secret to making a small kitchen big is by organizing it smartly. So if you have space saving hacks for a small kitchen on mind? You are in the right place! Here are the best kitchen hacks to help you organize and own the space.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Saving hack for a small kitchen &#8211; wire shelf risers!</h2>



<p>What you see is one shelf, and what we see are ways to maximize that space using wire shelf risers. With these shelf risers, you can add storage space vertically, giving you tons of space to store all your dishes and bowls. Pretty cool, small kitchen hack, eh?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Divide and conquer with this small kitchen hack!</h2>



<p>This simple hack will help you find those knives, serving spoons and the darn sieve when you need &#8217;em. These dividers are not restricted to stationery and small items in the kitchen. They can also be used to store other big kitchen tools.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Rethink storage with pan organizers!</h2>



<p>Ahh, pots and pans, indeed the noisiest members of the kitchen family.</p>



<p>TBH, no matter how hard you try to keep them neat &#8211; they always end up one on top of the other. However, this is a game-changer, and it also tops our small kitchen organization hacks. Basically, you can store pans, lids, chopping boards too using these pan organizers. Cool Stuff!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Think vertical</h2>



<p>Pegboards are a great way of storing utensils. Not only does it look super fun, but it is also very accomodating. You can hang anything as small as a pair of scissors to anything as big as your pans. Moreover, you can even turn one of your kitchen cabinet doors into a chalkboard to keep track of your inventory or create a grocery list.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Iron Shelves = Maximum Storage</h2>



<p>A small kitchen means that there won&#8217;t be enough space for the pantry, especially big items like grains, flour, and oil cans. Try adding a set of industrial wire shelves to your kitchen; not only are they cheap but they&#8217;re loaded with space. You can change the look of the shelves by adding baskets in natural materials like jute or cloth. This is one of those great space saving hacks for a small kitchen that looks super chic!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the most exciting things about moving to a new city or neighborhood are the restaurants you get to add to your must-try list. (Chances are there are a handful of mouthwatering places on your block alone.) But as much those dollar slices and falafels are calling your name, your wallet and waistline will take a major hit if you aren’t equipped to prepare some of your meals in your shared kitchen. That&#8217;s when you obsessively start looking up kitchen hacks and quick recipes and you end up here. </p>



<p>So, where do you go from here? While we’d all love to go on a massive shopping spree through William Sonoma, the moving process doesn’t leave much wiggle room in the budget for kitchen gadgets. So we checked in with the pros to see what they put on their list of must-haves when stocking a new kitchen. These essentials can mean the difference between an ever-growing takeout bill (and pant size) and delicious, homemade meals in minutes. Here are the first five things nutritionists buy when stocking a new shared kitchen, with our top picks for the splurge vs. steal. Grab a pot, some groceries and your roommate — it’s time to cook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Get a toaster oven for your shared kitchen</h2>



<p>So basic, and yet so useful, the&nbsp;toaster oven will become your new best friend on nights when your roommate decides to finally give that fancy 20-step Pinterest recipe a try (hogging all the pots and pans), or on days you get tied up at the office and just want to whip up an easy meal. In fact, some of the easiest <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi/">kitchen hacks</a> involve a toaster oven!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The kitchen gadgets that really count are those that get to take up the precious real estate on the countertops.. My first choice is a toaster oven. Unlike a toaster, with a toaster oven you can heat up items you might otherwise need to put in an oven (like a slice of pizza) or dinners in metal containers that you aren’t able to put in the microwave, and cook items to a delicious crispness (like roasted potatoes).&nbsp;You can make a quick meal for one by baking a chicken cutlet in the toaster oven — just place on a tray and add some seasoning, a drizzle of balsamic glaze and a drop of olive oil. Add to a salad and you’ll have a great, low calorie lunch or dinner.”</p><cite><a href="http://www.bonnietaubdix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bonnie Taub-Dix, RD</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:</strong>&nbsp;<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-TOB-40-Classic-Toaster-Broiler/dp/B004JMZGM2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broiler</a>, $79.95</span><br> <strong>Steal</strong>: Black &amp; Decker Black Toaster Oven, $29.99</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Food Processor</h2>



<p>Not only does it store easily in a small cabinet, but this handy gadget will majorly cut down on meal prep time. You can chop and mince ingredients in minutes. It&#8217;s one of the greatest kitchen hacks ever! Plus, think of all the smoothies you’ll be making in your shared kitchen!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“A must-have pick for my first kitchen was a small, countertop food processor — not a huge, expensive KitchenAid, but a tiny one that’s perfect for a super small apartment or studio. In fact, I still use my tiny processor all the time in my current kitchen, which is larger than my first&#8230; Having a food processor of any size is a must if you plan to make vegetables a regular part of your meal plan, which of course we all should! If you’re very short on space, it can even sub as a small blender (you can make smoothies in it!) and it’s great for making servings for one, so if you live on your own you don’t feel like you’re going to have large amounts of food waste.”</p><cite><a href="http://www.erinpalinski.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Erin Palinski-Wade, RD</a></cite></blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Dutch oven is a must for your shared kitchen</h2>



<p>A Dutch oven is the perfect addition to a co-living household and those awesome potluck dinners you’re dying to have. But make sure to choose a vibrant color. So, the nest time you host friends for a <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/10-ingenious-kitchen-hacks-to-save-time-roomi/">dinner</a>, you can bring it right to the table! Save yourself a dirty dish. That&#8217;s one of the most useful kitchen hacks out there!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“One of my first, and most essential purchases, was my big 7-quart Dutch oven. It’s still a fixture in my kitchen, some 8 years later&#8230; As a graduate student, I used it to make all sorts of one-pot meals to get me through the week, like soups, stews, hearty pasta sauces, and curried chicken. It also doubles as a kitchen decor piece if you leave it out on the stove — I didn’t have enough cupboard space in my tiny studio to hide it away, anyway!”</p><cite><a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/johannah-sakimura-nutrition-sleuth/author/johannahsakimura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Johannah Sakimura, RD</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:</strong> <a href="https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/le-creuset-signature-oval-dutch-oven/" class="broken_link">Le Creuset Cast Iron 3.5-Qt. Wide Oval Dutch Oven</a>, $350</p>



<p><strong>Steal:</strong>&nbsp;Threshold Cast Iron Dutch Oven – 3 Qt., $29.99</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Blender</h2>



<p>No shared kitchen is complete without a blender. It’s the first item that <a href="http://www.francicohen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Franci Cohen</a>, certified nutritionist and personal trainer, stocks in a new kitchen. The appliance won’t take up precious real estate, and is essential to whipping up <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/nyc-gardening-hacks-herbs-to-grow-in-your-apartment/">smoothies</a>. And that&#8217;s a super easy way to up your fruit and veggie intake. Plus, If you’re one of those people who play whack-a-mole with their alarm clock every morning, your blender will ensure you have a filling and tasty breakfast to grab on the go – even when you have literally one minute to spare. You won&#8217;t need to search for kitchen hacks anymore after this purchase!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The night before, toss some Greek yogurt, skim milk, kale or spinach, banana, berries and almond butter in the blender bowl, cover and place in your fridge. In the morning, whip up your smoothie for a powerhouse breakfast loaded with vitamins, minerals, protein and calcium to keep you from visiting the vending machine before lunch.”</p><cite><strong><a href="http://www.bonnietaubdix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bonnie Taub-Dix, RD</a></strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>While smoothies may be the first thing that come to mind when reaching for the blender, that’s only scratching the surface.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Use it to make vegetable juices, soups, salad dressing and marinades for lean meat — even cocktails! You can also use it to create healthy white flour alternatives from healthy grains such as oats.”</p><cite><strong>Franci Cohen, RD</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ninja-BL660-Professional-Blender/dp/B00939FV8K/ref=sr_1_4?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444792364&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=blender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ninja Professional Blender</a>, $112.99<br> <strong>Steal:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-58148A-Multi-Function-Blender/dp/B00EI7DPI0/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444792364&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=blender" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hamilton Beach Power Elite Multi-Function Blender</a>, $26.85</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Chef’s Knife</h2>



<p>You won’t get very far prepping a healthy meal without a good knife.   Sakimura counts as one of her most essential early purchases.&nbsp;If you go for the splurge and invest in a high-quality knife, Sakimura recommends getting it professionally sharpened once a year. Your shared kitchen will immediately feel like a professional kitchen with a good chef&#8217;s knife!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I bought an 8″ chef’s knife, which is a great all-purpose knife. I went with the Wusthof Classic Ikon because I loved the weight and clean design. Talk about a good investment! I still use it almost daily, eight years later, and it has held up beautifully, despite slicing more than its fair share of produce, including countless watermelons and butternut squashes (I’m a nutritionist after all!) I’m sure I should have it done more frequently, but it seems to hold up fine!”</p><cite> <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/johannah-sakimura-nutrition-sleuth/author/johannahsakimura/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Johannah Sakimura, RD</a> </cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Splurge:</strong> Wüsthof Classic Ikon Chef’s Knives, $139.99-$199.95<br> <strong>Steal:</strong> Wüsthof Pro Chef’s Knife, 8″, $24.95</p>
