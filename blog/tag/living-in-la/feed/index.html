<p>Before packing up and moving to the City of Angels, there&#8217;s a lot to know. And no, we’re not talking about the crime. In LA crime is hardly an issue. It is a big city with millions of people, and it is more than safe to walk around alone in the morning. There is absolutely nothing to worry about in the night as well, as long as you’re with another person or two. Likewise, living with roommates in LA can be really benefiting besides sharing rent and having company! If you&#8217;re thinking about moving or want to try living in LA with roommates, here&#8217;s what you should know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cost of Living in LA</strong></h2>



<p>With the many perks of being in LA, residing here comes at a higher cost than in most countries. The trade-offs may be worth it depending on your lifestyle preferences and desire for incredible weather. Median rents around Los Angeles are crazy expensive, $1,511 for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,982 for a two-bedroom. That&#8217;s above the national average of $1,101 for a two-bedroom.</p>

<p>However, rents are less expensive than areas like New York City and comparable to other urban cities. Thus, living in LA with roommates, is a necessity more than a preference. It is the most convenient and affordable option there is! As <a href="https://patch.com/california/centurycity/tips-living-roommate" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharing an apartment</a> will cut costs when it comes to rent, groceries and decorating.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do you introduce yourself to a potential roommate?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQWBn1gUmNc" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Talk to your roommate</a> about where you come from, what you do and what you are interested in. Share information that you feel is important and relevant for roommates. You don’t have to pretend to be extra nice, just be yourself! And if you’re someone who’s socially awkward, let them know that as well. There’s nothing wrong with being transparent. After all, there’s a good chance you’ll be living with them for the years to come!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What should you discuss before moving in with roommates in LA?</strong></h2>



<p>Questions are the key element when dealing with roommates, maybe even more so than usual. Don’t be afraid to ask questions when you first meet your potential roommates. For example, how do you feel about having guests over? Are you more of a morning person or a night owl? What are you allergic to? Are you a neat freak or are you a little messy?&nbsp;How often do you visit home? Ask these questions and be honest in your answers. There’s no need for a filter here!</p>



<p>When you’re living in LA, and juggling between work and personal stuff, you don’t want your roommates to add-on to your problems. So, it’s important to talk through their lifestyle, habits and expectations to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-11-11/how-to-find-a-compatible-roommate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find compatible</a> roommates in LA.</p>

<p>Following these tips will help you have a successful first interaction to live with your roommate(s).&nbsp;Remember, it’s vital to communicate often and to be patient. Living in LA with roommates, is not that easy. You encounter people from different walks of life. Each person is different and initially you might have a hard time adjusting to their patterns and the roommate(s) with yours. Coliving is might seem stressful, but with a little pre planning, you and your roommates can help make it a better experience.</p>
