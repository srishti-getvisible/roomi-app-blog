<p>If you’re a young entrepreneur, you already know that running a business is risky. It’s the nature of the game. Honestly, that’s part of the thrill. But sometimes when you’re young, ambitious and enterprising, you might also think that you’re invincible. You might think, “<em>Of course, running a business is risky, but the worst will never happen to me! I know what I’m doing!”</em>. And while being confident is good, necessary even, it’s even better to be prepared. Especially <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/7-financial-lessons-to-master-under-age-30-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">financially</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-financial-management-and-why-is-it-important-for-you">What is financial management and why is it important for you?</h2>



<p>Financial management is the backbone of every business. You cannot run a business, at least not a successful one, if you don’t learn how to manage finances well. That’s how companies go bankrupt and are forced to dissolve. Of course, that’s a risk you’re taking every time you think of running a business. However, there are steps you can take to mitigate financial trouble and avoid that very outcome. Which is where financial <em>risk</em> management comes into play. We know, all these words are enough to induce anxiety, but don’t worry!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-s-some-tangible-things-you-can-do-to-get-started-on-financial-risk-management">Here’s some tangible things you can do to get started on financial risk management-</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Identify any and all of your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.eaglebusinesscredit.com/blog/understanding-credit-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit risks</a> as soon as you can. This way you’re one step ahead of any potential disasters and can sidestep easily.</li>



<li>Avoid loans and unknown financiers as much as you can, this will really help you in the long run.</li>



<li>Make sure you pay off your outstanding debts and balances in a timely manner.</li>



<li>Make sure you have reliable payment records in place.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>See, that’s not so hard, is it?</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-golden-rule-of-financial-risk-management-have-a-plan-b">The golden rule of financial risk management: Have a Plan B</h2>



<p>We know this sounds like a cop-out, but trust us, it’s anything but! Having a backup plan is the sign of an entrepreneur who knows what they’re doing. Think about it, would you want to work for someone whose ambition has given them tunnel vision or do you want a pragmatic leader who’s thought of every possible outcome and prepared for the worst? Yeah, that’s what we thought.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/202006/bill-shapiro/pivot-plan-b-failure-strategy-twitter-slack-youtube.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">plan B</a> truly saves your business when things start going south. And trust us, things will go south at some point, that’s just how it is. But it’s all about how you recuperate from those failures that will define your career. So, get thinking about your plan B!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-all-about-the-work-work-work-work-work">It’s all about the work, work, work, work, work!</h2>



<p>So, now that you’re an entrepreneur, you really should get comfy with doing market research and cuz that’s your life now! Of course, when your business grows, you can get more and more people on-board to help you out here. But till then, this is your job.</p>



<p>Doing your market research is such an important part of the job, we can’t possibly stress this enough. How much impact your business has is directly related to how detailed your market research was. After all, a shocking <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-white/most-businesses-fail-why-investing-in-the-right-id.html" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">percentage</a> of businesses fail because there just wasn’t any demand for their product in the market. This market research will also help you come up with a solid and sustainable business plan. This, of course, directly helps with financial risk management and helps grow the business in the long run.</p>



<p>Incorporating data collected via <a href="https://www.uniqode.com/qr-code-generator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniqode&#8217;s QR code generator</a> also enables smarter financial forecasting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learn-how-to-weigh-the-odds">Learn how to weigh the odds</h2>



<p>By now you can already gauge how much of being a young entrepreneur is just assessing risks. Risk assessment is of course not an exact science and no one can ever precisely predict the outcome of a business decision. However, you can certainly take calculated risks while minimizing losses. When you’re starting out it can be hard to know instinctively which risks are important and which ones can be pushed aside for a while. This is where a simple pen and paper will help. Write down all the possible risks and their outcomes.</p>



<p>Once you have all the information, it’s easy to assess which ones are important and have to be dealt with immediately and which ones can be left in the back burner for a while. That’s how you come up with a proper strategy to be fully prepared. And that’s essentially what financial risk management is all about. Having a good strategy and exit plan to deal with any financial fallout in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, countries around the world are facing COVID-19. But another pandemic lurks underneath and is less talked about: the epidemic of financial stress. The first one affects our lives, especially our health. And the second one is busy depleting our life savings however well we learn to manage our accounts. Although financial stress may be spreading as a by-product of the coronavirus pandemic, it has assumed massive proportions over time.</p>



<p>Financial stress has gained a life of its own with the closure of businesses, unemployment, and income loss. Needless to say, learning to cope with financial stress while learning to manage your accounts at such a critical time is important for your mental health. So we&#8217;ve put together some key tips.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Manage your mental health to deal with financial stress</h2>



<p>For the average person, financial stress is unavoidable right now. Sudden unemployment, a disruption in routine, uncertainty about the future, learning to manage your accounts are root causes of intense financial anxiety. And many of us feel there is no way out. It&#8217;s essential, then, to focus on your mental health during this stressful time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Take good care of yourself</strong> </h3>



<p>This begins with eating healthy food and following a good sleeping pattern. A healthy mind and body will be your best defense. Because it will give you the energy to deal with financial stress you might face right now. Health, they say, is wealth and is the best place to start.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practice healthy coping skills</strong> to deal with financial stress</h3>



<p>With lockdowns and physical distancing, it may not be possible to get to the gym or meet friends over coffee. So it&#8217;s time to change your go-to coping strategy and find suitable alternatives. You can experiment with other coping methods like video meetings with friends, using meditation apps, or spending more time in nature.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Be physically active</strong> </h3>



<p>In the current scenario, walking, strength training, and yoga are great ways to stay physically active. You&#8217;ll find lots of fitness trainers are running online classes to help you get in a great <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/creating-a-budget-friendly-gym-at-home-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">home workout</a>. So take advantage of this to keep financial stress at bay.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use your support system</strong> </h3>



<p>Share your financial stress with a trusted family member or friends if you feel that it&#8217;s getting overwhelming. Talking to your loved ones will lower your stress levels and make you feel less isolated. They could also find new perspectives on your situation or ways to get your financial anxiety under control.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Prioritize your payments</h2>



<p>As you need to spend cautiously right now, it&#8217;s important to manage your accounts and prioritize your bills. Especially those requiring immediate attention to deal with the financial stress. </p>



<p>As a first step, take care of your basic needs as a priority, as you may not have enough to make all payments. If you <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-things-to-do-if-you-cant-make-rent-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need to pay rent</a>, talk with your landlord to see whether they&#8217;re okay with you deferring the amount until you get back on track with your income. For credit card payments or home loan installments, talk to your bank. They may allow a delay in installments without the accrual of interest or late fees.</p>



<p>Depending on your location, government relief measures often allow banks and financial institutions to offer assistance. There could be options where you can pay late, pay less, or forego interest and late fees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Look for alternative sources of income</h2>



<p>No one is sure <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/career/10-job-opportunities-created-because-of-coronavirus-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how long this pandemic will last</a>. So it makes sense to look for other income sources to supplement your earnings. Check out online projects where you can use your skills to earn extra money to deal with the financial stress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Get a loan for emergencies that cause financial stress</h2>



<p>If your savings are depleting and your emergency fund is empty, consider applying for a loan. You can check with private online lenders about whether they can offer you a personal loan, small business loan, or a <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.moneytap.com/blog/personal-line-of-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">line of credit</a> at favorable terms to help you deal with the financial stress.</p>
