										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So you&#8217;re a big animal lover, and adopting a furry friend has been on your mind forever now. With all this newfound time on our hands now, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/how-to-manage-anxiety-stress-amid-a-pandemic-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">as the pandemic keeps us indoors</a>, it&#8217;s only natural to want to adopt a pet. But is it safe to adopt a pet in the middle of the pandemic? Are there certain rules you need to keep in mind while doing so? </p>



<p>The questions that can be asked here are endless. Being careful about the process should you be your topmost priority. Here are some things you must ask the animal lover in you, as you make your decision to adopt a pet. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Dogs have a way of finding the people who need them, filling an emptiness we don&#8217;t even know we have.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>Thom Jones</em></cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sure, you&#8217;re an animal lover. But are you truly ready to adopt a pet?</h2>

<p>Adopting a pet is a lifetime of commitment. Some say it is as good as adopting a baby. In the initial excitement, it&#8217;s easy to forget that caring for a pet is expensive and time-consuming. </p>



<p>You will have to be willing to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/6-golden-rules-to-plan-your-finances-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">organize your finances</a> to invest the money as well as the time to give your pet the lifestyle they deserve. At this point, you need to revaluate your lifestyle and see if it aligns with a pet&#8217;s basic needs. Being a responsible pet lover also comes with making monthly budgets, time schedules, and talk to a friend who already has a furry companion to get a more hands-on perspective.</p>

<p><a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/12/adoptions-dogs-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">There&#8217;s been a noted surge in adoptions ever since the coronavirus pandemic hit us</a>. While this is excellent news for shelters across the globe &#8211; adopting a pet due to the lockdown may not be viable in the long run. Our lives will resume soon, and the pandemic will settle, leaving our pets at home alone. The most common reason for abandonment in pets is the level of commitment. So be 110% sure with or without the coronavirus self-isolation influencing your decision.</p>

<p>If you are ready to be adopted by a cute little furry, search for your forever friend using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.petango.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Petango</a>. But before you dive into this really fantastic search engine by Petango &#8211; you need to get permission from some relevant parties.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check with your parents/roommates/flatmates. </h3>



<p>Although this is an independent decision, a pet will influence the lives of whoever you are sharing your accommodation with. Get their consent before you bring in your new roommate!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check with your landlord</h3>



<p> Ask about <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/five-common-questions-about-renters-rights-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">your rights as a renter</a> &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to surprise them after all. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re lucky, your landlord will be an animal lover just as you are. But with some, it is a big no-no.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t sneak in a pet ever! Instead, indulge in an honest conversation with them and give them plenty of information about your new friend. Tell them the pet&#8217;s breed, size, age, temperament, and reason for adopting (send them cute photos too, for extra bonus points). </p>



<p>Tell them you will be investing a lot of time into training the pet. Furthermore, make it known that if the pet does any damages, you will take responsibility for it &#8211; make sure you stick to this promise when the time comes!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;<strong>Before you get a dog</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>you can&#8217;t quite imagine</strong>&nbsp;what living with&nbsp;<strong>one</strong>&nbsp;might be like; afterward,&nbsp;<strong>you can&#8217;t imagine</strong>&nbsp;living any other way.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to do, then!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Foster them babies!</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re not just helping the animal but also the shelters. Shelters are overburdened with sick and abandoned animals. When you help them, you&#8217;re reducing the shelter&#8217;s burden and making space for new animals. </p>



<p>Most shelter animals share a painful past of abuse, abandonment, and rejection &#8211; fostering helps them meet loving individuals like you and helps them recover from their unfortunate past. Fostering saves lives, it will give you a chance to help a furry and be helped in many ways.</p>



<p><em><strong>Adopt! If you can&#8217;t adopt, Foster. If you can&#8217;t foster, Sponsor! If you can&#8217;t sponsor, Volunteer! If you can&#8217;t volunteer, Donate. If you can&#8217;t donate, Educate! Everyone has the ability to change a shelter animal&#8217;s life &#8211; be their voice!</strong></em></p>
