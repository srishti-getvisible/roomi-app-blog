<p>Did you know one of the most common reasons for clashes among couples is because of sharing a closet? Fighting over a disorganized closet, closet clutter, and not being able to find items are the most common causes of arguments between couples when it comes to sharing a closet. But you don&#8217;t need to go through all these ordeals like other couples. Try these 11 closet organization ideas and create a more harmonious space with your significant other!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-declutter">1. Declutter</h3>



<p>Unless you&#8217;re moving to a mansion with a shared walk-in closet, you need to manage with small closet space. Before organizing it, sort and segregate your belongings and review each of the items carefully. Ask yourself these three questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Have you worn it recently?</li>



<li>Does it fit?</li>



<li>Will you need it in the future?</li>
</ul>



<p>If your response is a no to all three questions, it is time to discard or donate the item. Make it a habit and repeat this exercise every season.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-work-with-your-partner-if-you-re-sharing-a-closet">2. Work with your partner if you&#8217;re sharing a closet</h3>



<p>Organizing a shared closet takes teamwork. Many couples prefer to split their closet space 50/50 but you don&#8217;t need to follow the same rule if you don&#8217;t want to. Instead, discuss your work time, morning routine, and habits to organize your closet. The purpose here is to not get into each other&#8217;s way while getting ready for the day.</p>



<p>For example, if both of you need to get ready for work at the same time, it makes sense to organize your stuff on two sides of the closet. But if you don&#8217;t need to access the closet simultaneously, you can share the drawer or the hanging rods without getting into each other&#8217;s way.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-store-off-season-items-separately">3. Store off-season items separately</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re sharing a small closet with spouse, use your closet space to store everyday work clothes, accessories, shoes, etc. Store all the off-season clothes like leather jackets, skirts, heavy woolens, etc., in separate storage boxes. Place them under your bed or any other corner of the room.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-label-storage">4. Label storage</h3>



<p>Storage boxes come in handy when sharing a closet. They can make up for drawers if you don&#8217;t have too many drawer spaces. Keep separate storage boxes for shoes, hats, innerwear, belts, etc. Label them or color-code them so that you don&#8217;t need to scramble through everything when getting ready.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-hire-a-professional">5. Hire a professional</h3>



<p>When you&#8217;re sharing a closet and your closet space is premium, hire a professional designer to maximize space utilization. A professional can help you customize the closet space by adding a shelf here or a cubby there, adding long and short rods, or shoe racks. Additionally, you can include a specialized storage accessory on your side of the closet, like a belt rack on one side and a jewelry drawer organizer on the other.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-consider-double-hanging">6. Consider double hanging</h3>



<p>Every closet can have enough space if you know how to use it cleverly. Couples sharing a closet often prefer double hanging because it&#8217;s the least expensive way to maximize closet space. What&#8217;s cool is with double hanging, you can store two times the shirts, blouses, and pants in the same vertical space.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-choose-velvet-hangers-over-wooden-or-plastic-hangers">7. Choose velvet hangers over wooden or plastic hangers</h3>



<p>Get rid of your chunky wooden and plastic hangers that chew up space and look ugly. Replace them with cohesive hangers. Velvet hangers especially look nice. They are sturdy, add space, and make your closet look much cleaner.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-maintain-your-shared-closet">8. Maintain your shared closet</h3>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re splitting your closet 50/50 or 70/30, you need to keep your closet organized for it to remain functional. Maintain some checks and balances to keep it clean and clutter-free. Like, whenever you take something out of the closet, put it back in the same place. And once a year, take time off from your regular schedule to do an annual decluttering of the closest to keep things organized.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-use-additional-storage">9. Use additional storage</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re still running out of closet space, consider using under-the-bed storage to store what you only occasionally need. Another idea is to utilize your wall—place hooks to hang your daily wears, belts, ties, and necklaces. Just remember to keep it neat and don&#8217;t dump everything on the hook. You can use creative racks on your bedroom wall where you can keep your accessories neatly arranged.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-practice-the-one-in-one-out-rule">10. Practice the one-in-one-out rule</h3>



<p>If you have limited closet space and there&#8217;s no possibility of increasing the closet space, practice the one-in-one-out rule. In practice, this means if you buy a new pair of shoes or a new dress, something needs to be taken out and either recycled or donated.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-create-visible-boundaries">11. Create visible boundaries</h3>



<p>One person&#8217;s belongings drifting to another partner&#8217;s territory is not an unusual scene when it comes to sharing a closet. So it is a good idea to use colored-coded baskets and bins to segregate the space inside the closet. You can even use different color hangers to hang clothes on the common hanging rod. Finally, use separate laundry boxes to gather your dirty clothes instead of impeding your partner&#8217;s closet.</p>



<p>Follow these basic but practical couple closet ideas to keep all your belongings organized, and there will be possibly no hang-ups &#8212; be it in your closet space or your relationship. Keep the lines of communication open when it comes to closet-related matters. Finally, be respectful of each other&#8217;s belongings and feelings. After all, these are just clothes. What matters most is your bond with one another.</p>

<p>So you got <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/dealing-with-a-coronavirus-quarantine-breakup-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuck living with your ex because of the pandemic and quarantine</a>, but now you are kinda tolerating each other? Or maybe you just can&#8217;t find someone else or are too lazy to start the hunt. You find yourself relating to all &#8216;living with your ex&#8217; memes, and have accepted the situation as it is. Maybe you even secretly like it (No judgment here.) You&#8217;re happy to be able to stalk them in real life instead of the gram. And maybe you&#8217;ve put all the best rules for living with your ex in place and have found success in cohabitating with your ex.</p>



<p>But wait, does that mean you should continue? If there&#8217;s a doubt, it&#8217;s time for you to get to the bottom of it. Let&#8217;s examine whether or not you should continue living with your ex and how to go about cohabiting with your ex peacefully if you choose to say yes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is it possible to live with your ex?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s like the age-old argument of whether or not people from the opposite sex can be &#8216;just friends&#8217; or whether or not a person can stay friends with an ex. Ultimately, it&#8217;s all about the two of you and the dynamic you share.</p>



<p>No one outside your bubble can tell you how things would go for you. So our suggestion is to understand what goes on between you and your ex. Evaluate how you feel around them, and maybe try and gauge how they feel around you. After all, home is where your heart is. And if yours or your ex&#8217;s heart is broken, the home will be as broken too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should you consider living with your ex?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re considering this question, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be (living with your ex). But who are we to judge? <a href="https://youtu.be/4OSXkHThqrQ">Nick and Jess</a> lived perfectly fine (sort of) after breaking up? Um, we shouldn&#8217;t have said that at all.</p>



<p>On a serious non-sitcom note, if being around your ex is <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/living-with-partner-after-breakup-bad-for-your-mental-health/">damaging your mental health</a>, and stopping you from moving on, then it&#8217;s probably not a good idea. Any negative feelings that might show up when they&#8217;re around are to be acknowledged. It will help you answer the question of whether or not you should be living with your ex.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rules for living with your ex</h2>



<p>Just like you need <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/rules-for-co-living-with-the-opposite-sex/">rules for living with the opposite sex</a>, so you don&#8217;t drive each other crazy, you need solid rules in place for living with your ex. We didn&#8217;t mean to rhyme. But well.</p>



<p>So what are these rules you need to have in place?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Don&#8217;t try to listen through the walls</h3>



<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s weird. So please don&#8217;t do it. If they&#8217;re talking on the phone, don&#8217;t try and stand close to the wall or the door and listen in. It&#8217;s not going to do any of you any good. So do what you&#8217;d do when living with roommates other than ex-lovers. Plug your earphones in when they get loud with their conversations because spiteful exes might try to pull that off just to annoy you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Don&#8217;t make it weird by avoiding them</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s natural to not want to make eye contact and stay shut in your room after you&#8217;ve broken up when cohabiting with your ex, who is in the living room right next to your door. But if you&#8217;ve considered living with your ex, you have to do things differently. Otherwise, you and your ex both are better off (living) alone.</p>



<p>So try going back to normal living in the house, except the coochie coo, and things won&#8217;t even feel much different, or awkward in the first place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Don&#8217;t force them to have a conversation</h3>



<p>It might feel a bit too awkward when you both sit silently far apart on the couch watching TV. But live with it. It&#8217;ll get normal sooner than later. Don&#8217;t try to force each other to talk just because it&#8217;s awkward. If it gets too much, head back to your room for some alone time, just like you would in any other roommate situation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Set boundaries with each other</h3>



<p>This one&#8217;s super important if you&#8217;re planning on cohabiting with your ex! If you and your ex are emotionally and mentally healthy enough to decide on staying together, then this is the easiest part!</p>



<p>Just have a conversation about what the boundaries are. Are you allowed to pass snide comments on the other person&#8217;s date? (Yes, it&#8217;s eventually going to happen, whether you like it or not.) Are you still allowed to enter the bathroom while they&#8217;re taking a shower? Talk about EVERYTHING.</p>



<p><strong>In the end, it&#8217;s all about how cohabiting with your ex goes in the near future. If you&#8217;re not sure but really want to give it a try, do it. But if you can&#8217;t seem to after all trials and errors, go ahead and <a href="https://roomiapp.com/roommates/new-york%20city?page=1&amp;pageSize=30&amp;q=%7B%22region%22%3A%22NYC%22%2C%22minAge%22%3A40%2C%22maxAge%22%3A50%2C%22usrType%22%3A%22both%22%2C%22neighborhoods%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22cities%22%3A%5B%5D%7D">find your next soul (room) mate</a>!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So you&#8217;ve found your soulmate, and you&#8217;re ready to take the next step of living with your significant other! First of all, a big congratulations! However, we want you to be prepared for what&#8217;s to come. Moving in with a significant other is great, don&#8217;t get us wrong. But of course there&#8217;s some things to think about. And yes, you need a checklist &#8211; a moving in together checklist to make sure love stays in tact and you make your own home sweet home. Let&#8217;s get right to it then, shall we?</p>



<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/4-myths-about-relationships-that-should-disappear-roomi/">Misconceptions About Love That We Should Kiss Goodbye</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Ask yourself and your SO the tough questions for your moving in together checklist</strong></h2>



<p>What are your reasons for moving in with your significant other? Are you both on the same page?</p>



<p>If not, is there a conflict regarding the different reasons?</p>



<p>Now, if you&#8217;re both being economical about it, thinking you have to commute to be together anyway, so why waste time and money on commute and rent in two places when you could be together all the time? That&#8217;s what you both want, right? RIGHT?</p>



<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s simply because you just can&#8217;t stay without each other anymore, and you want to make your own haven. Both reasons are okay! Just as long as both of you are on the same page and have no doubts about each other&#8217;s reasons, living with your significant other is going to be your paradise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Put who&#8217;s paying the bills and when in your moving in together checklist</strong></h2>



<p>If you&#8217;ve been dating long enough, you&#8217;d know each other&#8217;s habits(even the one related to money), and you probably split all costs anyway, right? But when it comes to paying rent, buying groceries, and actually living together instead of just going out to grab a burger or catch a movie, things are bound to get more serious.</p>



<p>So before moving in with your significant other, have a conversation, discuss <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/3-awesome-apps-splitting-bills-roommates/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">app options to split the bills</a>, and what happens in case someone is unable to pay the bills. It&#8217;s an important thing to discuss.</p>



<p>You might think love is way above money, which it is. But sadly, when money goes wrong in the relationship, love can too. So better to prepare beforehand, even if it&#8217;s an awkward conversation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. The chores</strong></h2>



<p>Well, this is one territory that you both might end up fighting about, A LOT when living with your significant other. So it&#8217;s much better to make rules before you enter the battlefield and start living there.</p>



<p>Divide the chores EQUALLY, and abide by the decisions taken. If you both would like, switch the rules up later, when you&#8217;re bored. But always keep it equal so that no one person has to bear the entire burden of making the house a home and keeping it that way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Are you keeping that?</strong></h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s something you need to face when moving in with your significant other. You don&#8217;t like all their stuff, and they don&#8217;t like yours. So just complaining about something you find weird sitting in your house isn&#8217;t going to cut it.</p>



<p>Instead, sit down together and look at all your stuff when you&#8217;re planning to move. Take decisions of giving away things that you collectively don&#8217;t want or need and get rid of them. (Unless you have a special reason and it&#8217;s allowed to be in the house.)</p>



<p>Remember they&#8217;re not your same-sex best friends, and they&#8217;re not roommates. When you move in together with your SO, everything belongs to both of you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. How often do the friends come around?</strong></h2>



<p>Sure when you&#8217;re in love, their friends are your friends, or maybe you have a whole gang of friends together, like &#8230; F.R.I.E.N.D.S. But the reason you need to put the &#8216;friends coming over&#8217; aspect in your moving-in-together checklist is to keep your home a safe space that allows chill time for both of you.</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t have friends over forever, and you can&#8217;t restrict them either when living with your significant other. So discuss how and when it is okay to ask them to leave you alone, or how to talk to each other if anything bothers the other about their set of friends.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. The need for your &#8216;me time&#8217;</h2>



<p>One of the taboos of moving in with your SO can be your alone time. The thing is, no matter how deeply you both may be in love, to crave for time alone is a human need, and very important for a healthy relationship with self and others.</p>



<p>So discuss how often you need to be alone, and why they shouldn&#8217;t worry about that behavior, and give you space. Decide on the spaces in the house that are appropriate for said alone time, etc.</p>



<p>In conclusion, being upfront about your relationship and having a solid moving in together checklist will help you keep each other and your home a loving space for your relationship to flourish.</p>



<p>Good luck, love birds!</p>
