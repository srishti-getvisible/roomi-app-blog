<p>The holidays are here! That means parties, fun, parties, family&#8230; did we mention parties? They&#8217;re undeniably one of the best parts of the festive season. It’s a great opportunity to connect with friends and family and get into the holiday spirit. That being said, planning a holiday party that runs smoothly can be stressful. This year, you don&#8217;t have to fret, because Roomi&#8217;s here to help! Stay tuned, as we list out some holiday party ideas and tips to help you make the most of this festive season.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="holiday-party-tips">Holiday Party Tips</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-what-s-on-the-menu">1. What&#8217;s on the menu?</h3>



<p>When planning your menu, remember to mix things up. You can include a variety of dishes, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/cocktail-recipes-for-a-very-merry-christmas-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">drinks</a>, desserts, and bite-sized snacks.</p>



<p>Plan your menu according to the estimated number of guests, but leave room for more just in case. Use an <a href="https://www.brandcrowd.com/menu-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online menu maker</a> tool to design beautiful menu cards to let guests know what they’re eating.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-create-your-guest-list-and-choose-a-date-that-works">2. Create your guest list and choose a date that works</h3>



<p>Do you want to stick to close family members or will you invite all your friends, neighbors, their pets and the local line-dancing society?! Draft up your guest list early on and liaise with key guests to choose the best date.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-send-out-invites-early">3. Send out invites early</h3>



<p>Once you’ve set a date for the party, you’ll need to send out invites. It’s advisable to send them out a few weeks &#8211; or even a month &#8211; before the due date. Mail them in the post, old-school style, or send out online invitations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-venue">4. Venue</h3>



<p>Selecting a venue depends on the number of people you&#8217;re inviting. If the party can’t be <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/hosting-a-christmas-party-at-home/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted at home</a>, consider booking a bigger venue. If this is the case, then book the venue early to avoid anything spoiling your plans.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-choose-your-decor">5. Choose your decor</h3>



<p>Decorating the venue is a sure-fire way to capture the spirit of Christmas at your party. The <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/christmas-light-decorations-for-apartments/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">kind of decorations</a> you’ll use largely depends on the theme you’ve chosen. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re going for a classic dinner party. You&#8217;ll need decorations like candle holders, or even flowers. We&#8217;ll get into great theme ideas shortly! For your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/diy-christmas-decorations-a-hygge-experience-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">decorations</a>, you can get a little holiday party inspiration from a movie or a local craft store.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-curate-a-christmas-playlist">6. Curate a Christmas playlist</h3>



<p>Nothing like good music to give some holiday party inspiration, and stir up the festive mood at your party! Make a playlist of fun and popular holiday songs —both old and new. Use platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube to create a festive playlist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-choose-a-theme">7. Choose a theme</h3>



<p>A great theme sets the atmosphere and tone for your party. It also determines the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/small-apartment-christmas-decor-ideas/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">decorations</a>, lighting, and color scheme. Here are some themes you can try:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Classic dinner party</li>



<li>Pajama party</li>



<li>Ugly Christmas Sweater</li>



<li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/6-secret-santa-gifts-when-co-living-with-roommates-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Santa</a></li>



<li>Tree Trimming</li>



<li>Winter Wonderland</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-plan-parting-gifts-to-give-to-your-guests-after-the-party">8. Plan parting gifts to give to your guests after the party</h3>

<p>Don’t let your guests go home empty-handed. Include cool parting <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/gifting-ideas-for-the-babe-on-a-budget-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">gifts</a> in your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/how-to-celebrate-enjoy-christmas-on-a-budget-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">budget</a> while planning your party. You can buy to-go boxes for guests to take home yummy homemade desserts and treats.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="holiday-get-together-ideas">Holiday Get Together Ideas</h2>



<p>It’s okay if you’re stumped on ideas for your party. Here are some fun holiday party ideas you can try to make that day memorable:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-fun-games">1. Fun games</h3>



<p>When choosing games, consider your guest list. How many people are coming and what mix of personalities can you expect? This will help you plan games and even prepare some prizes to spice things up.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Gift wrap game</strong>: This could be an individual or team game. Test your guests to see who can wrap a gift the fastest – with only one hand!</li>



<li><strong>Holiday movie trivia</strong>: This is a fun holiday get-together idea. Have your guests answer questions on classic and modern <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/top-christmas-movies-on-netflix-to-watch-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christmas films</a>.</li>



<li><strong>2 Truths &amp; a Lie</strong>: In turns, let guests give 3 statements, and have the others try to spot the lie.</li>



<li><strong>Jingle Bell Toss</strong>: See which of your guests has the best aim. Hot-glue cups to a surface, and toss jingle bells in them to score a point.</li>



<li><strong>Christmas Limbo</strong>: Find out how low your guests can go in a Christmas-themed limbo challenge. You can use a candy cane or a Christmas scarf to set the bar.</li>



<li><strong>Charades</strong>: Make your party more entertaining by having your guests act out their favorite holiday movies.</li>
</ol>



<p>Remember to choose the ones that will suit the kind of guests you&#8217;re inviting!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-christmas-karaoke">2. Christmas Karaoke</h3>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<p>Another great holiday get-together idea is having people sing along to Christmas songs and carols. Sing songs like Feliz Navidad, Deck the Halls, Jingle Bell Rock, etc. It’s time for Christmas Carol-oke!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-watch-holiday-movies">3. Watch holiday movies</h3>



<p>Watching <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/more-christmas-movies-on-netflix-to-watch-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">holiday movies</a> is one of the most fun holiday party ideas ever! Offer your guests a great cinematic experience by sharing popcorn, sweets, or drinks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-cookies-and-tree-decoration">4. Cookies and tree decoration</h3>



<p>A <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/eco-friendly-christmas-tree-ideas-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christmas tree</a> decorating party is one of the most traditional Christmas parties there is. Make provisions for colorful Christmas ornaments for your guests to place on the tree.</p>



<p>Buy cookie decorations beforehand and let guests try their hand in decorating delicious cookies. Everyone can then swap their masterpieces after.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-pictures">5. Pictures!</h3>



<p>Picture taking is one of the best holiday party ideas because you get to save the fun party moments forever. You could even set up a quaint homemade photo booth to let your guests take beautiful holiday photos.</p>

<p>The jolliest season of all is here! Christmas party is all about celebrating with friends and family, eating delightful feasts and of course, the annual viewing of <em>Elf!</em> However, taking on the responsibility of hosting a Christmas party at home can be stressful. To make your Christmas party a memorable one, we have some easy Christmas party ideas that go beyond just decoration or a Christmas menu.</p>



<p>So, whether you wish to have a glamorous Christmas party in a small house with friends and family, or are celebrating with roommates, we have the holiday party guide to make the big day worth remembering!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hosting-christmas-don-t-forget-the-to-do-list">Hosting Christmas? Don&#8217;t Forget The To-Do List!</h2>



<p>The holidays are the busiest time of year for most people, but planning ahead can ensure everything runs as smoothly as Santa&#8217;s Workshop when you&#8217;re hosting a Christmas party at home!</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>[ ] <strong>Mark a date:</strong> It&#8217;s important to pick a date for your celebration so it doesn&#8217;t clash with anyone&#8217;s holiday plans.</li><li>[ ] <strong>Guestlist</strong>: Design your guest list according to your apartment size and the number of people it can comfortably cater for. Even if you&#8217;re hosting Christmas in a small house, you can still have a stellar guestlist!</li><li>[ ] <strong>Plan out the budget</strong>: Work out a budget and stick to it! Short on cash? Plan a potluck party or a short and sweet festive menu, with just enough food to fill up everyone&#8217;s stomach.</li><li>[ ] <strong>Entertainment and games:</strong> You want a fun, lively party, and one way to get everyone involved while hosting Christmas is with some classic holiday games! Some games we love are: <code>a) Charades b) Pictionary c) Trivia d) Christmas dance freeze e) Bring Me</code></li><li>[ ] <strong>Favors:</strong> Nothing makes for a memorable party more than a party gift. Some cute Christmas party favors include:</li><li>Socks</li><li>Personalized keychains</li><li>Handmade holiday cookies</li><li>Hot chocolate sticks of various flavours i.e. mint chocolate, orange chocolate, dark chocolate etc.</li><li>[ ] <strong>Send out invitations:</strong> The earlier you send invites, the better! Now that everything is ready, it&#8217;s time to let your loved ones know that you are hosting a Christmas party.</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="it-s-time-to-decorate">It&#8217;s Time to Decorate!</h2>



<p>The sound of the crackling fire, the smell of cedar tree and freshly baked cookies, and the beauty of falling snow, Christmas is a holiday that appeals to our every sense!</p>



<p>Want to recreate this natural essence in your home? We&#8217;ve got some easy Christmas party ideas to get your guests&#8217; holiday senses tingling!</p>

	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="theme">Theme</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s time to flex your decorating muscle. Now, it could be tempting to decorate the corners of your place in random Christmas garb. But we suggest you pick a theme, especially when you are hosting a Christmas party in a small house.</p>



<p>Consider a color theme, such as silver and red or gold and green. Consider asking your guests to dress up to match the theme, for some unmissable photo ops!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="playlist">Playlist</h3>



<p>Hosting a Christmas party at home without music isn&#8217;t really a party, so plan out your playlist in advance. Ask your friends and family if they already have a go-to festive playlist, or take song requests prior to the party.</p>



<p>Choose some classic tunes that people just can&#8217;t help singing along to. Everything from The Pogues to Mariah Carey is acceptable here.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="set-up-a-self-service-table">Set Up a Self-Service Table</h3>



<p>While your friends are gossiping about some hot news in their workplace, you don&#8217;t want to be too busy serving beverages to catch up.</p>



<p>Prepare a self-service table where you keep the drinks and snacks. Place some pre-made signature Christmas party cocktails in beverage dispensers, and guide guests to the fridge to help themselves to wine and beer.</p>



<p>For guests that don&#8217;t drink alcohol, add a section of non-alcoholic <a href="https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g29386984/non-alcoholic-christmas-drinks/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christmas speciality drinks</a></p>



<p>like Cranberry-Ginger Shrub or super delicious Slow Cooker Pear Cider.</p>

<p><strong>Decorative Ladders</strong></p>



<p>Decorative ladders are a stylish and smart way of revamping your small space for a Christmas party. Adorn it with fairy lights, bows and other embellishments.</p>



<p><strong>Downsize The Tree</strong></p>



<p>When you are dealing with a small apartment while hosting a Christmas party, downsizing your tree can save a lot of space. Whether it&#8217;s fresh or fake, size doesn&#8217;t matter when it&#8217;s sparkly and beautiful!</p>



<p><strong>Scented Candles</strong></p>



<p>Scented candles can create a festive mood in no time! We love gingerbread, pine tree, cinnamon and berry this time of year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The holiday season is upon us! And now all of the troubles and turmoil this year has come with seem to be at bay,. At least as long as the tree is up, fuzzy socks are hung, and Mariah Carey is being played. So to round it all off? <strong>Curling up with the best Christmas movies on Netflix (<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/easy-cocktail-recipes-to-try-at-home-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and a warm cocktail</a>) is one of the most time-honored traditions.</strong></p>



<p>And we want to help you figure out where to start the holiday indulging. So we have made a list of our favorite Christmas movies on Netflix!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <em>Christmas in the Heartland</em></h2>



<p>Think&nbsp;<em>The Parent Trap</em>, but set during the Christmas season. And it makes for one of the cutest Christmas movies on Netflix! So as the story goes, Kara Gentry (Sierra McCormick) and Jessie Wilkins (Brighton Sharbino) meet on an aeroplane headed to the same town. Furthermore, the identical girls decide to switch places, and naturally, drama ensues. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <em>Santa Girl</em></h2>



<p>Being Santa&#8217;s daughter definitely comes with its own set of challenges. In brief, she&#8217;s all set to marry some pre-approved guy and follow into the family business. Consequently, Cassie Claus (Jennifer Stone) is able to attend a semester of college in the &#8220;real&#8221; world. So safe to say, this is one of the most enigmatic Christmas movies on Netflix.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <em>Christmas With My Father</em></h2>



<p>In brief, comedian Jack Whitehall and his father, Michael, go on adventures around the world in the Netflix show Travels With My Father. So in this Holiday special, the father-son duo in their goofs and grumpy moments apply their signature chemistry. Equally important, the cherry on the top? The Fab Five of Queer Eye help the duo with their bond.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <em>Get Santa</em></h2>



<p>What do you think would go down when Santa shows up in your shed? This is one of the most adorable British Christmas movies on Netflix! And it follows the unfolding of events when a family goes through this same exact thing. So this film has a hapless Santa &#8211; played by Jim Broadbent, a staple in the other quintessential British kids&#8217; movies, Paddington.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. <em>Holly Star</em></h2>



<p>In brief, a broke, down-on-her-luck puppeteer returns home for the holidays. She gets caught up in an exciting treasure hunt with her paintball-obsessed best friend. Along with her tango-dancing grandmother, and a childhood sweetheart. To summarize, this is one of the quirkier Christmas movies on Netflix. And this one&#8217;s bound to make you long for love! ?</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. <em>A Cinderella Story: A Christmas Wish</em></h2>



<p>Since the 2004 Hilary Duff hit, the <em>Cinderella Story</em> series has been around like Santa&#8217;s elves. The fifth and most recent installment, starring Laura Marano, is about an aspiring singer-songwriter who gets a shot at stardom and love during the Christmas season. Nevertheless, this is one of the few musical Christmas movies on Netflix you can sing along to!</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. <em>This Christmas</em></h2>



<p>In brief, <em>This Christmas</em> is a Christmas movie on Netflix that centres on the Whitfield family, whose eldest has come home for the first time in four years. In fact, it is inspired by Donna Hathaway&#8217;s 1970 song of the same name. And the family gets together to deal with everything left unsaid, for this intense family Christmas special.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. <em>A Very Murray Christmas</em></h2>



<p>This is one of those Christmas movies on Netflix that feel too good to be true. It&#8217;s what the industry calls a star-studded Christmas Special, which is <em>about</em> the making of a star-studded Christmas Special! In brief, Sofia Coppola directs the hour-long show, which stars Bill Murray, George Clooney, Amy Poehler, Michael Cera, Chris Rock, Rashida Jones, Miley Cyrus, and many more.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. <em>Drunk Parents</em></h2>



<p>To summarize, Alec Baldwin and Salma Hayek play a couple hiding their dwindling financial situation from their college-aged daughter. With holiday season approaching, so does the daughter&#8217;s time to come back home &#8211; and the parents&#8217; actions are just about to catch up with them. While this could be the premise of a drama, it&#8217;s actually a star-studded Ch, even if its that of an acquired taste kind.</p>
