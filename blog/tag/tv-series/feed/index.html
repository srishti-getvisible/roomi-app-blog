<p>One of the biggest things we were grateful for in 2021 was Netflix. And the internet, of course! We can&#8217;t even begin to imagine what quarantine would be like without them. Having said that, finding a genuinely binge-worthy show on Netflix can be quite a daunting task &#8211; and often takes more time than actually watching the show. That&#8217;s why we decided to cut your search time in half and share those hidden gems on Netflix.</p>



<p>Add all of these to your watchlist or just stream them one after the other like we do. NO SPOILERS in this article&#8230; you&#8217;re welcome!</p>



<p>Oh and, before we move ahead, <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/top-7-movies-to-watch-on-netflix-in-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">if you&#8217;re more of a movie person, we&#8217;re got you covered still!</a></p>

<p><strong>Seasons on Netflix</strong>: 3 seasons</p>



<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Thriller, Drama, Science fiction, Mystery, Supernatural</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Der anfang ist die ende und der ende ist der anfang.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Netflix&#8217;s first German-language original series is indeed very dark, mysterious, and super gripping. If the concept of time and space interests you, then this is the right series for you. The story is set in a small quaint town named Winden, where four families struggle with their estranged pasts. </p>



<p>Every character in this series is connected to the other &#8211; it&#8217;s weird and twisted, and the connection unravels gradually. It may seem slow initially, but once you&#8217;re past the first premises, you can&#8217;t help but stay hooked. Netflix recently released their season finale, so you don&#8217;t have to wait to know the real story. This is by far, one of the best shows to watch on Netflix, ever.</p>

<p><strong>Directed</strong> by: David Fincher</p>



<p><strong>Seasons on Netflix</strong>: 2 seasons</p>



<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Crime film, Psychological thriller</p>



<p>Mindhunter explores the inception of behavioral sciences and the study of the most notorious killers and their damaged psyches. This show focuses on criminal psychology, letting killers like Ed Kemper &amp; Jerry Brudous narrate their stories instead of concentrating on the heinous crimes they committed. All in all, a superb psychological thriller with a profound meaning which tells us how killers are not born but are made by us.</p>

<p>Directed by: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Romanek" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Romanek</a></p>



<p>Seasons on Netflix: 1 season</p>



<p>Genre: Supernatural horror, Fantasy, Drama</p>



<p>One of the top streaming shows to watch on Netflix, <em><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/_EonRi0yQOE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Locke and Key </a></em>released in the year 2021. Mysterious and magical with a mix of darkness, this is an adult version of a fairy tale with a glimpse of dark reality and evil. </p>



<p>The series follows three siblings who, after their father&#8217;s murder, move into their old ancestral house to discover the mind-boggling truth of the Keyhouse. It&#8217;s perfect for watching on weekends when you&#8217;re not working from home or banging your head against the wall in pandemic frustration. <em>places an icepack on head</em></p>

<p>Directed by: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Schrader" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maria Schrader</a></p>



<p>Seasons on Netflix: 1 season</p>



<p>Genre: Drama</p>



<p>This one&#8217;s based on the autobiography of <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Feldman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deborah Feldman</a>, who is portrayed by a young woman named Etsy in the series. The story revolves around a young, determined woman who doesn&#8217;t agree with the norms set by her orthodox Hasidic Jewish community in Brooklyn. She abandons the rules of society to discover a new life and a new identity for herself. It is gripping, emotional, motivational, and shows the path to self-exploration.</p>

<p>Seasons on Netflix: 1 season</p>



<p>Genre: True Crime, Documentary</p>



<p>Where do we even begin? It&#8217;s tough to summarise a documentary that is so bizarre and whacky but also addictive. There&#8217;s nothing quite like the Tiger King; the story revolves around Joe Exotic, who owns several big cats, including tigers and lions in his GW Zoo, Oklahoma. </p>



<p>Things were ideal for Exotic with multiple husbands and an extravagant lifestyle before an animal activist named Carole Baskin comes along. Their rivalry grows with each episode till Exotic hires a hitman to remove the &#8220;thorn in his side&#8221; and ends up in jail. Sounds like a drama, right? But it&#8217;s a documentary!</p>

<p>Narrated by: Desiree Burch</p>



<p>Seasons on Netflix: 1 season</p>



<p>Genre: Reality-TV, Light-hearted, Fun</p>



<p>Reality TV at its best! Think $100,000 on one side and SEX on the other. This show is about hot people trying to build meaningful relationships without touching each other. So who measures how meaningful their relationship is? A talking cone named Lana! Pssst&#8230; she is supposedly a talking assistant, but TBH she is more like the celibacy-police. </p>



<p>This one&#8217;s definitely a fun watch for those that have hit a dry spell due to the pandemic. Hate it or love it, but before you know it &#8211; you will be hooked.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-best-of-the-classics-you-can-watch-on-netflix">Best of the classics you can watch on Netflix!</h2>



<p>Tbh there will be days when you will feel like &#8220;ugh there&#8217;s literally nothing left to watch,&#8221; and that&#8217;s when you should revisit some old-time favorites like &#8211; Friends, Two And A Half Men, That 70s Show, Gossip Girl, and The OC!</p>



<p>Fun and easy-going shows have been a staple for us during this 2021 pandemic. Even if you have been living under the rock or in a cave for a while there&#8217;s no way you don&#8217;t know these absolute rockstars of shows &#8211; Brooklyn 99, Rick and Morty, Jane The Virgin, Castlevania, Schitt&#8217;s Creek, and The Big Bang Theory!</p>



<p>We&#8217;re currently on our third run of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKDWKDEugU" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Girl</a>. NO regrets whatsoever.</p>
