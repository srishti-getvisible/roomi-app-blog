<p>Patience is key, and you&#8217;ve got to learn to be a little more realistic with yourself buddy (if you want to nail your resolutions!).</p>



<p>So, here are some healthy and totally achievable New Year Resolutions for 2021!</p>



<p><em>Pssst&#8230; we added some hilarious New Year Resolution memes to lighten the mood.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Budgeting</h2>



<p>If there&#8217;s anything 2020 has taught us, it&#8217;s that we need to budget and save more money. This New Year resolution will help you in the long run, because even the best of us need savings for a rainy day!</p>



<p>This New Year 2021 try apps like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mint.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mint</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">You Need a Budget</a>&nbsp;which can help you track your spendings and stick to your budget like a boss!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Food for thought!</h2>



<p>A sharp mind and great vocab are by-products of reading. Can you think of a better month to start reading than January? We can&#8217;t! Just make a warm cup of cappuccino and snuggle up with your favorite novel. If your new year&#8217;s resolution is to read at least 12 books by the end of the year &#8211;&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up on Goodreads.</a>&nbsp;Review each of your new reads and track how many books you read in 2021 &#8211; challenging yourself is always fun!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Connect with God or explore spirituality</h2>



<p>2020 has been a tough and challenging year for all of us. Yet, many people found peace and joy in God or through finding themselves spiritually.&nbsp;<a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://billygraham.org/story/searching-for-peace-spend-time-with-god/#15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Here&#8217;s an easy step by step guide by Billy Graham to get you started</a> on your journey. If not, why not listen to some uplifting music? Some great gospel artists include Rivers &amp; Robots, Johnathan Ogden &amp; Hillson, and you can find them on Spotify or youtube! A great and achievable New Year resolution, indeed!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Make quiet time a daily habit, but don’t get discouraged if you occasionally miss a day or two. You wouldn’t quit eating if you missed breakfast.&#8221; </em></p><cite><em>&#8211; <a href="http://billygraham.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billygraham.org</a></em></cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Giving Back</h2>



<p>Leading research shows that volunteering can help to reduce stress and even lower blood pressure. What&#8217;s better than giving back to a community or a cause that you feel super passionate about? Not much! So if supporting a cause is what you want to try as your new year&#8217;s resolution, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a34429072/giving-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here&#8217;s a great tool-kit to get you started in the art of giving back!</a></p>

<p>Nope, not your sick dance moves &#8211; it&#8217;s time to drop the old habits you&#8217;ve been trying to rid yourself of for years!

The perks include a good mood, glowing skin, better sleep, and an improved immune system. Plus, it will help you save so much money. Win, win.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a smoker, then there&#8217;s literally no better time to quit. Tobacco and any other smoke-related product like Hookah &amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a24233519/is-vaping-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">vapes can pose a serious threat to your life.</a>&nbsp;Smoking is a nasty habit and many smokers find it difficult to break free from it. However, there are many resources that can help you quit this habit for good:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. New year&#8217;s resolution for you and your roommate: Communication!</h2>



<p>One of the most important new years resolutions with your roommate has to be of communication! Communication is absolutely key in any healthy roomi relationship. Your roommate is not a mind reader, even if you think they are! If something is bothering you, make sure to bring it up with your roomi. Talk it out so that the issue doesn’t become bigger.</p>



<p>This is one of the new year&#8217;s resolutions for you and your roommate that helps better understand one another’s personality and living habits. Instead of being passive-aggressive when your roomi forgets to do the dishes, bring up the issue in a non-threatening way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. New year&#8217;s resolution with your roommate: Go over your roommate agreement</h2>



<p>If you haven’t already made one, make resolutions for you and your roommate to create an agreement for 2021! A roommate agreement helps you and your roommate better understand each other’s expectations. Roommate agreements don’t have to be set in stone, they can change as you and your roomi grow as individuals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Areas to cover in your roommate agreement can include </h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>personal boundaries, </li><li>how to handle cleaning,</li><li>how to handle rent and other expenses, </li><li>quiet hours, etc. </li></ul>



<p>Communicate with your roomi to see what they’d like to add to your roommate agreement for the new year!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. New year&#8217;s resolution for you and your roommate: Talk about finances</h2>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/the-best-money-saving-apps-to-reach-your-finance-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Talking about finances can be a tricky subject, but it doesn’t have to be!</a> Make a new year&#8217;s resolution with your roommate to plan a designated time each month to go over your money expectations and expenses. Make sure that you plan talking to your roomi about finances early on. So that you start 2021 off on the right foot.</p>



<p>First, make sure you have established a monthly budget for you and your roommate. Go over how to handle paying rent as well as other utility bills, such as the electricity and the internet. Next, make sure that you <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.splitwise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agree on an app</a> or a self made system detailing how bills will be paid. Check in with your roomi every month to make sure that all bills are being paid on time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. New year&#8217;s resolution with your roommate: Split up your chores</h2>



<p>Let’s face it, no one enjoys doing the dishes. So one way to help decrease confusion around who’s responsible for doing what chores is to make new year&#8217;s resolutions for you and your roommate to create a monthly chore calendar. Additionally, creating a schedule will help the two of you stick to a routine and keep your apartment clean and tidy. So have fun with making your schedule by choosing a pretty calendar and using colorful markers!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Plan time during the week to bond with your roomi</h2>



<p>It can be hard to find time to sit down and have one on one time, even if your roommate is your BFF. So it’s important to set aside time to bond with your roomi regularly. </p>



<p>Coordinate a set time every week or so when you and your roomi can bond. Whether it’s going out to eat at a restaurant or staying in and watching your favorite movie on Netflix, your roomi will be happy to spend time with you no matter what you’re doing!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Setting goals is proven to be an essential factor in finding success, and this applies to all aspects of life. So naturally, when it comes to money-making, setting your financial goals can help you prioritize! It can give you a clear idea of how and why you’re saving your hard-earned money. Your money goals can be anything–from getting out of debt to investing in real estate &#8211; it’s simply what you want to be able to do with <em>your</em> money!</p>



<p>Setting goals is one thing, but transforming those dreams into reality is another!</p>



<p><strong><em>These tips will help you set up a doable plan for all your money goals in 2021!</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Set a target date for your money goals.</h2>



<p>Financial goals are typically categorized in three different ways. You have short-term, mid-term, and long term financial goals.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Short-term financial goals: six months to five years</li><li>Mid-term financial goals: five to 10 years</li><li>Long-term financial goals: more than 10 years</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Your money goals need a financial plan.</h2>



<p>A financial plan is a document that details how you plan to reach your financial goals. Your plan takes everything about your life into account, from your marital status to your career goals.</p>



<p>Your financial plan should always begin by answering the question, <em>“What do I want my life to look like X years from now?”</em>. It can be tough to figure that out, so give yourself time to think.</p>



<p>Once you’re clear on that, you can create a feasible roadmap for your finances to support your desired lifestyle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Setting a budget is the easiest hack to achieving financial goals.</h2>



<p>Setting a budget allows you to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/5-ways-to-ask-parents-for-money-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise discipline</a> when it comes to how much of your money is going to be spent on necessities, recreational expenses, or savings and investments.</p>



<p>By setting a budget (and sticking to it!), you’ll be able to better control how you are able to reach your other financial goals.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Along with a budget, create goals for your savings.</h2>



<p>Take the time out to set a savings goal for the year. Your savings goal should be attainable yet as large as you can manage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get your credit in check! </h2>



<p>Get a handle on what your credit score is and the factors that are affecting it. If your credit score ends up being lower than you would like it to be, begin taking steps to improve it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you don&#8217;t know where to start, start with a side hustle.</h2>



<p>Your financial goals shouldn’t just be about spending money &#8211; or saving it. It could also be about actually making more money. How could you achieve that? Perhaps by starting a side hustle!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research and see where you can grow towards your money goals.</h2>



<p>Take some time to research companies to invest in. 2021 might just be an amazing year to get amazing deals, so when the market plummets, you&#8217;ll want to be ready to take advantage of the fire sale.</p>

<p>Whether you <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/virtual-christmas-party-ideas-for-2020-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">plan a party</a> to celebrate the festivities or decide to stay indoors with the roomis <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/top-christmas-movies-on-netflix-to-watch-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bingeing on movies</a> and <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/ideas-for-christmas-dinners-to-try-with-roomies-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">cooking delicious meals</a>, your home should be somewhere you can relax and recharge.</p>



<p>Since we stay home so often now, things may seem a little boring once the festivities end. With that in mind, cleaning and organizing your room, and rearranging the furniture could be a great way to break the monotony and revamp your space. We promise it&#8217;ll be fun!</p>



<p>And <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/4-tips-to-declutter-if-youre-a-hoarder-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for the hoarders</a> among us, give your home a refresh; it could be exactly what you need to start the new year in the right way.</p>



<p>No matter which species of hibernator you belong to this winter season, here&#8217;s your guide to rearranging your home. Make the New Year feel even more shiny and brand new.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Clean, Clean, Clean</h2>



<p>Just like us (thanks 2020), our homes have started to gather up dust. And there&#8217;s no better time than the holidays to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/deep-clean-and-sanitize-your-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep clean your room (and the whole apartment)</a> well.</p>



<p>If the winter blues are getting you down, cleaning is something that can actually be quite meditative. Allow the process of cleaning to take your mind off of the daily stresses of life. Then chill, lay on the bed and admire your work once you&#8217;ve successfully cleaned and organized your room. Sit back and feel the bliss!</p>

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. A space to NOT BREAK your new year resolutions</h2>



<p>If you make a new year&#8217;s resolution to get fit or start learning a new skill every year, only to end up breaking it with each coming new year – you can blame your <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/home-environment-and-healthy-living-habits-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">home environment</a> for it! If you only cook up ideas on how you&#8217;ll shed the extra pounds or learn the piano without making space for it, then chances are you&#8217;ll forget to make it happen.</p>



<p>Why not clean and organize your room, and create a space (a small corner will do!); here, you can undertake each resolution goal and actually take steps to reach it!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Deep clean your room: Make space in your closet</h2>



<p>Remember the magical worlds through the closet in Narnia? Now, remember how the closets looked? They were tidy, and had the space in them that could lead to the adventures. So apart from cleaning and organizing your room on the outside, clean the inside too!</p>



<p>While we don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ll be able to transcend into a magical world, it will definitely help to give a new look and feel to your home. You shouldn&#8217;t let piles of clothes fill up inside just because you can close them shut behind you. Clean and organize your room by getting rid of the extra stuff. </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. &#8216;Tis the season to DIY</h2>



<p>Buying decor for your apartment isn&#8217;t as fun as making it! Keep your room clean and organized with some DIY. So, keep those hands warm with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/5-diy-hacks-to-make-your-weekend-great-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DIY decor</a>; use the money you save to buy beautiful gifts for roomis, friends, and family this festive season! </p>



<p>Bonus: You&#8217;ll have something more creative to do apart from endless Netflix binges during the holidays!</p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. More of the green, green stuff</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s always a good time to get your hands on the green stuff. MORE PLANTS! There are many <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/gardening/g27210824/buy-plants-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">websites you can buy plants from</a>.</p>



<p>Or, make a quick visit to your nearest nursery. Stock up on winter greenery to make your home feel fresher and greener in the new year. Plants are always a good idea after you deep clean your room.  </p>

				</div>
								</figure>
	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Let go of the things you haven&#8217;t used in 2020</h2>



<p>A great tip for <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/idolize-marie-kondo-de-clutter-with-these-hacks-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decluttering and tidying up</a> your home this new year is to let go of the past! Look around your home. See some stuff you keep saying you&#8217;ll use, but never actually do?</p>



<p>When you&#8217;ve been at home all year long, and there are still things you&#8217;ve never used, what&#8217;s your excuse? The hard fact is that it may be time to find the stuff that has been gathering dust. Let go of these to clean and organize your room&#8230;and your mind!</p>
