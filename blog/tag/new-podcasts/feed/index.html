But among others, podcast creators have been using their creativity to help listeners get through these strange times. These quarantine podcasts have save us all during these uncertain times. So, to help our readers, we&#8217;ve decided to make a list of our podcast picks for the pandemic.</p>



<p>Some new podcasts had experts helping listeners through various issues, and some well-established ones experimented with pandemic topics. Make your extended alone time at home interesting with our picks of pop-up pandemic podcasts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Our Plague Year</h2>



<p>Now, this had to be the first of our podcast picks for the pandemic. The creator describes this current-events pop-up podcast as “an experiment in public anxiety.” The talks on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ourplagueyear.libsyn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our Plague Year</a> offer peeks into the lives of regular people living through quarantines and lockdowns, helping listeners <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/8-quarantine-activities-to-unleash-the-artist-in-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survive the pandemic</a> together.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Home Cooking</h2>



<p>All we had were the odd collection of kitchen rations when the first lockdown was announced. Our creativity in the kitchen <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/cooking-in-quarantine-expectations-vs-reality-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been tested extensively</a> during these weeks in quarantine. So, chef Samin Nosrat took questions on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://linktr.ee/homecooking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home Cooking</a> podcast and suggested delicious recipes that use the bare minimum. Listeners found <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/lazy-roomi-cooking-9-recipes-for-slow-lazy-days-roomi/">easy recip</a><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/lifestyle/lazy-roomi-cooking-9-recipes-for-slow-lazy-days-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">es and answers to their individual tricky situation. For example, one caller </a>had a vegan roommate and a meat-loving partner. While another had stocked a massive quantity of beans. The episodes are also full of ridiculous puns and infectious laughter! Trust us when we say this is one of the best quarantine podcasts out there! So, make your quarantine productive with Samin Nosrat!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. The Kids Are All…Home</h2>



<p>True to its name, <a label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://pineapple.fm/stuck-at-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">The Kids Are All…Home</a> is exactly what parents of young children are looking for. These episodes are made for children – to keep them entertained and their imaginations active. The creators describe the podcast aptly as a “podcast for kids with nothing to do, by kids with nothing to do.” So, the episodes explore the creativity of kids with the help of wacky questions (and wackier answers), made-up scenarios, derailing conversations, and more. This is certainly the most creative one on our list of podcast picks for the pandemic. So, make your kids&#8217; make your quarantine productive with this podcast!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. The Distance: Coronavirus Dispatches</h2>
