										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When finding a home to rent, with all the amenities that help you create an oasis for yourself, finding the perfect roommate often turns out to be the toughest task of them all. Shared living in and itself comes with its own set of challenges, often unanticipated, even if it&#8217;s your fourth or fifth time renting. The perfect roommate, or what we&#8217;re calling your soul-roommate, doesn&#8217;t have to a long-lost dream though.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/benefits-conveniences-roommate-finder-app/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Related: The Benefit And Conveniences Of A Roommate Finder App</a></p>



<p>Like every other relationship ever, it&#8217;s only obvious that deciding what we&#8217;re looking for in a roommate would be a learned-over-time kind of deal.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all about trial and error, y&#8217;know?</p>

<p>The top 10 attributes people look for in a roommate, based on a survey conducted in 2019 with over 6000 people, are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Respect</li><li>Responsibility</li><li>Honesty</li><li>Cleanliness</li><li>Friendly</li><li>Quiet</li><li>Non-Smoker (Help My <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/help-my-roommate-smokes-and-i-dont/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roommate Smokes</a> and I Don&#8217;t)</li><li>Age</li><li>Similar interests</li><li>Love for animals</li></ul>



<p>Other close contenders to this attribute-list of the perfect soul-roommate were gender, having furniture, an inclination towards cooking, similar dietary habits, and tastes in music.<br><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-real-roommate-problems-resolve/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Related: 5 Real Roommate Problems And How to Resolve Them</a></p>



<p>These are the most common attributes people generally look for when choosing the right roommate. Finding <em>your</em> &#8220;perfect&#8221; roommate, however, might take a little more effort on your part than initially anticipated.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s a walk-through on picking a soul-roommate that might just come close to perfect.</p>



<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: In a shared living situation, these qualities are equally applicable to yourself, the reader, too. This ecosystem exists on a very delicate line of stretched-out thread and you&#8217;re holding one end taut just like your roommate with the other end, capice?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does the word &#8216;soul-roommate&#8217; mean to you?</h2>



<p>We often carry with us the habits we form in our previous living situations to the new setting. The thing is, these habits might not always click with your new roommate. What might be a random bit you like indulging in, might just be a deal-breaker for the roommate you seek.</p>



<p>We advise creating an actual list of things you want from your <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/ways-to-make-a-new-roommate-feel-welcome-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">new roommate</a>. Make this as personal as you can. If luck&#8217;s on your side, your roommate and you might just have multiple similar interests and needs. If that&#8217;s not the case, we recommend communicating your likes/dislikes clearly and being equally willing to accommodate their likes/dislikes too.</p>


	<div class="wp-block-jetpack-gif aligncenter">

	</div>
	


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Flexibility and perfect roommates that go beyond yoga.</h2>



<p>Flexibility in shared living can be a little more complicated than fixing a yoga routine together. What you seek is bound to conflict with what your roommate(s) want at some point or the other. From a simple furniture addition to more serious issues like smoking and fights with their better-halves you wish you didn&#8217;t witness &#8211; especially the night before an important exam.</p>



<p>Soul roommate or not, we recommend getting this out of the way first. The best solution to creating certain boundaries is to get creative with it. </p>



<p>Get together and create a fun roommate agreement! A piece of paper where each party notes down their deal breakers, boundaries, and compromise points. Make this a sacred document, one that might also serve as a great centerpiece on your living room wall!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A table for two, please!</h2>



<p>A known trick to getting to know someone and see if you are a good match is to share a meal, in a public setting, with maybe a drink and a half. How people act in restaurants can be very insightful and often tell you things you might have otherwise failed to catch. Be on the lookout for those that seem too &#8220;good to be true&#8221; &#8211; chances are they probably are.</p>

<p>Inviting them to a casual hang/party with your mates might also be a good bet if the person&#8217;s already moved in. Your friends might help you understand them better while also giving them a chance to understand you and your circle. </p>



<p>Managing expectations with your soul-roommate? Check <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The mighty rule of &#8220;good enough&#8221;.</h2>



<p>Any relationship is bound to experience conflict. In a situation where disagreements arise between you and your roommate, it is important to know how your roommate responds to stress. This enables you to successfully resolve a conflict without any unnecessary damage.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/5-common-behaviors-passive-aggressive-roommate/" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">Related: 5 Common Behaviors Of A Passive Aggressive Roommate</a></p>



<p>Instead of fighting over what you want vs what they want, try and find a middle-ground which is, yep you guessed it, <em>good enough</em> for both you and your roommate. All you need to have is an attitude that is willing to compromise. Be respectful if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re hoping to get in return.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Space, and stuff, y&#8217;know?</h2>



<p>One of the main challenges of shared living is setting boundaries. How do you make sure you&#8217;re respecting the other person&#8217;s personal space and boundaries and vice-versa?</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/4-expert-tips-co-living-introvert-roommate/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">4 Expert Tips For Co-Living With An Introvert Roommate</a></p>



<p>If it&#8217;s a material thing that you need and your roommate has it, it&#8217;s always best to ask. There&#8217;s nothing worse than accidentally breaking something of your roommate&#8217;s that you didn&#8217;t ask to use in the first place.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s personal space that you think might become an issue, since the space you share with the other person is quite tight, be a little more open about what you are feeling and encourage them to do the same. A good trick is to run over your day with them in casual conversation so they know what you&#8217;ll be up to and leave you alone when you need it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of opportunities out there to help you find a roommate through apps.

This leads to a lot of diversity in posting style, which can be a bit confusing and make room-to-room comparisons a trial. Unfortunately, it also has a reputation for being a haven for scammers, shady brokers, and other undesirables.</span></p>

A quick filter menu at the top lets you set things like minimum and maximum price, pop in the neighborhood, and off you go. If you want more filters, you can add them in this room finder app. The interface gives you a scrolling option of whatever fits your filters, or you can jump over to the map view and select things based on location. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it doesn’t let you find roommate in </span>this<span style="font-weight: 400;"> app, so you’re still stuck there.

<p>It&#8217;s the recommended app to <mark>find roommate</mark>(s). <a href="https://roomiapp.com/local/New+York+City" class="broken_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roomi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was started after all three of these options and was able to take the things people didn’t like about the websites and addressed them when starting the company.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We combined great local advice, secure chat, roommate finder app, apartment finders, helpful renting advice, and an easily accessible customer service crew all into one. For renter one-stop-shopping, our site has lots of benefits to offer.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Apartments.com</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finds roommates: <strong>No</strong></span></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finds rooms: <strong>Yes</strong></span></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Renter advice: <strong>Yes</strong></span></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Local guides: <strong>Yes</strong></span></li></ul>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nice GUI, easy to filter when searching large areas</span></p>



<p><a href="https://www.apartments.com/apartments/new-york-ny/?bb=_qk0nj3i5Hu766n54H" target="_blank" label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apartments.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a pretty slick graphic user interface or GUI. That’s fancy talk for the window you mouse around on when you want to use their website. This won&#8217;t help you find a roommate, however, it&#8217;s easy to scale in and out of large areas, even on statewide or national levels, and add or remove different filters. The listings update quickly and smoothly, which is a nice perk for large scale searches while finding a room. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two major drawbacks though. One, this app doesn’t help you find a roommate. Two, it’s built for more national and state level searches. The renter&#8217;s advice on the blog is quite good but very general. The local guides offer nice overviews of a city or neighborhood but don’t get into many specifics and don’t update often.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every apartment finder in NYC is a little bit different, and there is no shortage of websites that specialize in the New York City area. With so many options, it can be tough to figure out how to prioritize one over the other. Here is a list of qualities you should look for in the best apartment finder apps in NYC that specialize in serving the city!</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An NYC Apartment Finder Should Help With Roommates Too</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us can’t afford to live on our own in New York City. Mere mortals like us need a roommate to help with rent. So if you’re using an apartment finder in NYC, it really needs to help find roommates too. Otherwise, you’re putting a lot of effort into winning only half the battle. That’s like ordering a BLT and getting empty bread. Or worse, getting the meat without the bread . . . messy. So find the peanut butter to your jelly and get together with a great roommate while you&#8217;re searching for an awesome place to live.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Scrollable Map Feature: A must in NYC apartment finder</strong> app</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&nbsp;don’t really need a car in New York City. In fact, having a car in &#8216;The City That Never Sleeps&#8217; is more likely to rev up your stress than anything else. Parking is a full contact sport, sans helmets. Assuming you can find one close enough to where you want to be without passing out from dehydration before you trek there. </span></p>

<p>Your NYC apartment finder app should include public transportation, grocery stores, super cool bars and clubs. Parks, coffee shops, craft breweries. Nobody packs more diversity into a single city block than NYC. Nobody! Every neighborhood in The Big Apple has a different personality. So check out the local eats, music scene, and shops on the NYC apartment finder in detail.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cars are just another expense too. Not just car payments. Oil changes. Tune ups. The occasional trip to the body shop, courtesy of your friendly neighborhood scratch artist. So yeah, skip the car if you can. But not having your own wheels means knowing what’s available in your local area is super important.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t commit to an apartment, buy into a neighborhood.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Safe And Secure</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shady brokers and shifty landlords are like cockroaches. You can hear them scuttling around out there, but the second you turn on the lights, they vanish. You shouldn’t have to invest a bunch of your time making sure the person on the other end of the email is legit. Let the apartment finder app in NYC take care of that for you. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The site should have real, actual human beings digging through the listings and taking out the trash as a service to you. That way, by the time you get there, it’s pristine, safe, and secure.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Accessible Customer Support is basic to any apartment finder app</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should be able to talk to someone quickly and easily in case you have a problem. Some NYC apartment finders make you submit an email, and it can take days for them to respond, or longer. In New York City, a good apartment can get snatched up in a fraction of that time. Heck, even a bad one moves way faster than that. </span></p>

<p>Hence, c<span style="font-weight: 400;">ustomer service should be on hand when you need them. Or at the very least, able to get back to you within 24 hours. That way you’re not sweating it out wondering if that perfect place vanished while you were waiting for someone to get back to you.</span></p>

There’s practically enough paperwork to build an entire apartment out of recycled forms. There’s a lot of extra steps, and you need a guarantor who makes at least forty times the monthly rent. Yup. That’s right. Forty. So make sure that whichever apartment finder app you use, also gives rental advice and tips for living in New York.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a perfect roommate just isn’t a thing. Doesn’t mean you can’t strive for the best! Big city or small town, it’s important to know where to start when it comes to who you choose to share toilet paper and possibly most real side of yourself with. Trying to <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/find-roommates-nyc/">find</a> a good roommate is hard. So, here are 3 traits you should be looking for in a roommate.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Compatibility is important when looking for a roommate</h2>



<p><b><b><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing yourself and your own personal habits will be the key when looking for the ideal roommate. This person lives a similar lifestyle to you making for a peaceful household. If you party, don’t shack up with someone who goes to bed by 10pm. If you’re a student, find another! If you haven’t been bitten by the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/how-to-declutter-when-you-share-an-apartment-roomi/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tidy bug</a> it&#8217;s best not to choose a roommate who does the “white glove” check. The traits you should look for will be similar to the traits you possess. Know your lifestyle! </span></b></b>Because, <b><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">remember, wh</span></b></b>en trying to find a roommate<b><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; opposites do NOT attract.</span></b></b> </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are they happy?</h2>



<p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on how often you’re around happy people, this can be an easy one to spot. Living with a <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/10-things-happy-people-differently.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">happy person</a> is contagious<span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the other end, living with a notably unhappy person can be a vacuum for your energy. Try looking for a roommate who give off happy vibes. People that aren’t superficial. Because if someone seems peaceful, content, and living with purpose, the type of stability it can bring to their mood is palpable. THIS is who you want to be living with!</span></span> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are they trustworthy?</h2>



<p><b><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to tell if someone is <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-Someone-Is-Trustworthy" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">trustworthy</a></span></b> <b><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be tricky. So, plan a couple meetups before you choose to live with someone. Recognize how they treat your time. Do they agree on plans then bail? You can tell a person is trustworthy by how they value you and their commitment to the plans you’ve made together. At the earliest sign of shadiness, run. Because <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/the-dos-and-donts-of-sharing-an-apartment-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">living with a roommate</a> you’re not sure can be trusted will be uncomfortable. So, when looking for a roommate, </span></b>try to find someone who you can trust with your life. </p>

<p>Finding a roommate is hard, but it pales in comparison to the daunting task of getting to know them. Depending on the length of your lease, you may be forking over a year of your life to this person. Living in the same <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/apartment-hacks/decluttering-101-to-be-or-not-to-be-messy/">home</a>, sharing good times, laughs, but also stress, bills, and responsibilities. Even if you’re a private person, your life will inevitably seep over into your roommate’s existence, and vice versa. Since getting to know your roommate is super critical to a healthy, happy living situation, you need to choose the best approach to get to know a prospective roommate as thoroughly as possible before the pen hits the paper and you’re locked in. Using a roommate finder app on your phone has a lot of advantages.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background wp-block-heading"><strong>The Benefits of a Roommate Finder App</strong>!</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#1</strong> <strong>You can text people in a natural setting with a roommate finder app</strong></h3>



<p>When people are at home, at the <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/finance/frugal-living-how-to-get-groceries-on-a-budget-in-nyc/">grocery store</a>, or waiting for a bus, they are more relaxed. More themselves. Interviewing face-to-face tends to create the infamous “interview honeymoon” scenario. When a company interviews a potential employee, they are on their best behavior. With a polished, toothy grin, they assure you everything is just so great! And the interviewee is also on their best behavior. They nod enthusiastically, yes, yes, everything is wonderful! Nobody wants to even begin a conversation that might allude to something negative three questions down the road. </p>



<p>It’s like politically correct chess, always thinking a few moves ahead. Then, work starts and the employee realizes everyone is, in fact, miserable there and the company realizes the employee thinks 9-5 is for chumps. (And seriously, who works 9-5 anymore? More like 7-7.) So use intermittent text messaging through a secure roommate finder app like Roomi to get a more realistic feel for who your roommate is by catching them in natural settings.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#2 Get to know roommates just like you would anyone else</strong></h3>



<p>Pretty common scenario: you meet someone for the first time. They seem cool. You exchange numbers and text each other for a while before you actually do anything together. It’s a great system. You get to know them a little at a time, do you best to filter out the weirdos, and by the time you actually hang out, you’ve got a feel for who this person is. So why should getting to know a roommate be any different? If it’s because you’re slammed for time, that sucks. But to help out, <a href="https://roomiapp.com/">roomiapp.com</a> has lots of expert blog posts on moving strategies so you can avoid that in the future, and find great roommates too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#3 Catch people in different moods and modes</strong></h3>



<p>Have you ever met someone, then described them to a friend as really happy-go-lucky? Then your friend wrinkles their nose in confusion and says, “Wait, that guy? I know that guy, and he’s a total <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/coliving-101-help-my-roommate-is-really-creepy/">jerk</a>!” And then either you or your friend find out that you just happened to catch them during an off-moment and got a totally off-kilter impression. Roomi lets you get to know someone over time, and you’re bound to catch a few different moods and get a sense of how they handle different scenarios. When their car <a href="https://www.allstate.com/tr/car-insurance/what-to-do-when-car-breaks-down.aspx" class="broken_link">breaks down</a>, do they laugh about it, or send a tire iron through the nearest window? (Statistically speaking, the nearest window is liable to be their own, so hey. Not super smart dude.)</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center has-yellow-background-color has-background wp-block-heading"><strong>The Conveniences of a Roommate Finder App</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#1 It works better for your schedule</strong></h3>



<p> Your life is busy. You’ve got some unfathomably <a href="https://www.snagajob.com/blog/post/balancing-a-busy-schedule" class="broken_link">hectic</a> combination of work, a social life, school, and family. Taking an hour out of your day to sit down and do an interview with someone, especially if you have to drive, is tough to fit in. An app will make life so much easier because you can use it anytime, anywhere.</p>

	</div>
	


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#2 You’ve got a log you can go over later</strong></h3>



<p> We’ve all a moment where we were in a fantastically good mood and, as a result, let our guard down or made a bad call. If you are really excited over talking to your new roommate, then great! But did you misinterpret anything? Are there questions you forgot to ask? Do yourself a favor and go over it all again when you’re feeling a little more level headed, just to be sure. Have you ever gotten the wrong impression of a roommate? What happened to change your opinion? Post your comments below.</p>
