<p>Are you considering relocating to “The Big Apple”? If you are considering which of NYC’s five boroughs to call home, then get rooms for rent in Bronx county or “the Bronx”, with its melting pot of cultures and pride. While Manhattan will always be accessible, one of the primary benefits to living in the Bronx is its varied landscape and lower costs of living, primarily due to the lower rental rates. Not sure where to begin your search? Learn about the best places to get apartments for rent in Bronx.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting to know Bronx</h2>



<p>The Bronx is a borough in New York City located at the northernmost end of the city, and it is the only borough that is on the mainland, as the others are islands! Geographically, The Bronx is a very diverse borough. Some regions are so hilly, staircases are used instead of sidewalks to connect the streets. There is a great deal of variation in the apartments in Bronx in terms of neighborhoods, types of housing, views, and others. Certain enclaves (such as Riverdale) offer views of the river, large homes, and leafy streets. Others are more industrial, with apartments and lots of warehouses as opposed to home-based mom-and-pop shops. The best way to learn more about The Bronx? Go outside and experience the world for yourself.</p>



<p>While most people seeking an experience of New York flock to Brooklyn or Manhattan, there’s plenty of NYC pride to be found in The Bronx as well. The Bronx is home to baseball team the <strong><a href="https://www.mlb.com/yankees" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Yankees</a></strong> and their corresponding stadium, as well as valued green spaces such as Van Cortlandt Park, the Bronx Zoo, and more. The Bronx is not only known as the birthplace of hip-hop, but also for its close-knit community atmosphere.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How transit friendly is Bronx</h2>



<p>The Bronx offers excellent ways to move about in the city, the most preferred being the bus transit system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">1. Walkability: </h3>



<p>The Bronx, NY has a <strong><a href="https://www.walkscore.com/NY/Bronx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walk Score</a></strong> of 93 out of 100. This location is a Walker&#8217;s Paradise so daily errands do not require a car.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">2. Roads/Traffic: </h3>



<p>Many New Yorkers and tourists who have been to New York City will suggest you not drive in the city. Generally, people do not need a car since they can take a taxi or take the subway to get where they need to go. Parking costs can quickly add up, especially if you&#8217;re staying for several days.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Taxis </h3>



<p>Taxicabs are available in two colors: yellow and green; they are one of the city&#8217;s most recognizable symbols. Yellow taxis (medallion taxis) are capable of dropping off passengers anywhere in the five boroughs. Those painted <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/businesses/green-cab.page#:~:text=Street%2Dhail%20Liveries%2C%20also%20known,St%20and%20East%2096th%20St.)**" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">apple green</a> (street hail livery vehicles, commonly known as &#8220;Boro taxis&#8221;) pick up passengers in the Bronx, Upper Manhattan, Staten Island, Queens (excluding John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport), and Brooklyn.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">5. Airports</h3>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.laguardiaairport.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York LaGuardia Airport</a></strong> (LGA) is the nearest airport to The Bronx. The distance between New York LaGuardia Airport and The Bronx is approximately 5.0 miles (8.1 kilometers.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><meta charset="utf-8">6. Cycle Friendly</h3>



<p>Of the 5 boroughs, The Bronx comes 4th in safety for cyclists and 45th in the entire country. Making it a not-so-friendly state to cycle in. This is according to a report on <strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2019/05/07/only-part-of-the-city-is-bike-friendly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Street Blogs</a></strong>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tourism in Bronx</h2>



<p>Most tourists will no doubt never make it to the Bronx (unless perhaps to watch a baseball game at Yankee Stadium). That’s a real shame, because the overlooked borough has a lot to offer when it comes to culture. First, it is home to hip-hop culture. A few other highlights include the oldest public golf course in the country (Van Cortlandt), Bronx Museum of the Arts, Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, and New York City’s sprawling botanical gardens.</p>
