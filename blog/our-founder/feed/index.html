										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While cold emails might be worth trying as a last resort, there is so much more you can do to strike up a conversation with a desired potential partner or mentor. That’s why we asked 12 entrepreneurs from Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) how they go about getting the attention of higher-ups.

<p><strong>FROM HUFFINGTON POST: </strong>For three years, building my own brand was dead-last on the priority list. I promised I’d get around to eventually—but first, I had a product to build, capital to raise, a team to grow, and a community to nurture. And wasn’t all this personal brand stuff just a popularity contest anyway?</p>
</div>
<div class="content-list-component text">
<p>Don’t make the same mistake. As startup founders, we need all the help we can get: We’ll need to persuade investors and inspire our team. We’ll need to delight users and move journalists. This is where your personal brand comes in, allowing you to reach like-minded people across the world and bring them together, in one place. Brand building, after all, is just <em>relationship </em>building at scale. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/58ade431e4b040d4868a6395">Continued….</a></p>

Certain patterns are universal in the lifecycle of a typical startup, and specific traits differ based on cultural and local norms. India and the US, two leading nations in tech innovation, are excellent subjects for examining universal elements of international startups, as well as differences. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ajayyadav/2016/09/22/how-securing-startup-funding-in-india-differs-from-the-u-s/#7411a872205a">Continue reading</a>.</p>

Those with specialized training and previous experience can save a business precious time, costly mistakes and missed opportunities.  Continue reading <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ajayyadav/2016/07/13/why-a-young-ceo-should-hire-industry-veterans/#430d51881e35">here</a>.</p>
