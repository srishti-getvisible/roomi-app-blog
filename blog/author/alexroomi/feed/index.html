										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>City life is fun and always bustling with a ton of things to do and learn, but it can also be confusing and overwhelming. Add to this the almost impossible task of finding a decent apartment or room to rent, and you’ve got quite a challenge on your hands.</p>



<p>Luckily, today’s highly advanced digital technology can help you decode city life and figure out how to find the best rental without losing your time and brain cells in the process. Think of it as having your own personal real estate assistant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While you might be familiar with the basics, like online listings, there are many other handy resources available now. From neighborhood insights to rent prediction analytics, digital innovations offer new ways to discover hidden gems.</p>



<p>Experts suggest leveraging these tech advances so you&#8217;re not overwhelmed by endless choices. If you don’t know about these tools or how to use them, keep reading, as we have a few hot tips for you.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-virtual-reality-tours-seeing-is-believing">Virtual Reality Tours: Seeing is Believing</h2>



<p>Virtual reality (VR) tours transform the rental search experience, letting you explore properties from your living room. These immersive tours let you take a virtual stroll through spaces, giving you a real sense of size and layout.</p>



<p>One practical example involves using <a href="https://lovo.ai/text-to-speech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">text-to-speech</a> tools that allow you to listen to the place’s specs in a realistic voice while touring. This technology enhances accessibility for everyone by providing clear audio cues during the tour.</p>



<p>Furthermore, a rental with a VR tour often signals that the owner embraces modern technology and values your time. This tech-savvy approach suggests they&#8217;re forward-thinking and potentially more responsive to tenants&#8217; needs.</p>



<p>Also, VR tours allow you to evaluate the property&#8217;s condition thoroughly, which can indicate that owners take pride in their offering. They likely maintain their properties well, ensuring everything looks its best online.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smart-neighborhood-mapping-tools-finding-the-right-fit-nbsp">Smart Neighborhood Mapping Tools: Finding the Right Fit&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Did you know there are easy-to-access digital tools that let you compile valuable data on everything from transit options to local amenities?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadly, many renters out there don’t know about these tools or don’t know about all their features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, you can use tools to familiarize yourself with all the public transport routes in a new city. Besides making life easier for newcomers, they also provide real-time information, helping you understand how easy your commute will be and which areas have convenient access to public transportation.</p>



<p>Additionally, you can use tools to identify local amenities and services like grocery stores, parks, or gyms and understand <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/most-walkable-neighborhoods-in-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">how walkable the neighborhood is</a>. By assessing proximity to essentials, you&#8217;re better equipped to choose an area that suits your lifestyle needs without endless searching.</p>



<p>You can also learn a lot about crime in a specific area. This feature lets you gauge how safe a neighborhood might be for living comfortably.</p>



<p>Now, if these features sound a little too good to be true, here are the tools that can provide this type of information and more:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Walk Score: </strong>This platform evaluates how walkable a neighborhood is and provides insights into nearby amenities.</li>



<li><strong>Citymapper: </strong>Known for its detailed public transport routes and live updates, this app helps you navigate city commuting efficiently.</li>



<li><strong>Nextdoor: </strong>Although primarily a social networking service for neighborhoods, it offers insights into local community happenings and resident opinions.</li>



<li><strong>AreaVibes: </strong>Offers comprehensive data on livability scores by factoring in amenities, cost of living, crime rates, schools, and user reviews.</li>



<li><strong>Google Maps with Street View:</strong> While well-known for directions, its street view feature allows virtual exploration of neighborhoods to get an authentic feel without physically visiting.</li>



<li><strong>SpotCrime or CrimeMapping.com: </strong>These platforms provide detailed reports on recent crime activity in various areas to help evaluate safety levels effectively.</li>



<li><strong>Green Map System: </strong>Offers maps highlighting environmental aspects like parks or recycling centers beneficial for eco-conscious individuals seeking greener urban living options.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-noise-level-monitoring-apps-quiet-living-choices">Noise Level Monitoring Apps: Quiet Living Choices</h2>



<p>Even if you like to party, this doesn’t mean you want to live in a noisy neighborhood. But assessing the noise level in an area you don’t know can be difficult. However, unless you want to <a href="https://roomiapp.com/blog/us/apartment-hacks/cheap-easy-ways-to-soundproof-your-room-roomi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="broken_link">learn how to soundproof your room</a> or apartment, it’s a good idea to try and make sense of the noise level before you move in.</p>



<p>Luckily, nowadays, you can use noise-level monitoring apps like SoundPrint or Decibel X. SoundPrint lets users share noise levels of venues, while Decibel X turns your smartphone into a sound meter, offering real-time decibel readings wherever you go.</p>



<p>Broader platforms, such as the NIOSH Sound Level Meter, provide accurate noise assessments with comprehensive data logs and analytics features. These tools help identify locations where traffic or nightlife may impact living quality.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-make-chore-amp-expense-management-a-breeze">Make Chore &amp; Expense Management a Breeze</h2>



<p>Living with others means sharing chores and expenses, a task that’s usually left to the most reliable of you. If you’re the reliable one, you probably have a book full of frustrating stories to tell about your flatmates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But you don’t have to shoulder the entire responsibility any longer. With the help of apps like Splitwise and the good old Google/Apple Calendar, you can use technology to streamline these processes and bug your roommates.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.splitwise.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splitwise</a> helps you manage shared expenses. The app tracks who owes what, so no more awkward money conversations. Google or Apple Calendar keeps everyone on the same page when planning your schedules or chores. It also sends out reminders, so your housemates can’t say they didn’t see the chores chart pinned to the fridge or kitchen door.</p>



<p>With these tools managing everything, you can easily keep track of whose turn it is to wash dishes or pay rent without ever needing face-to-face conversations if you’re not up for it. Doesn’t this sound cool?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mingle-with-the-locals">Mingle with the Locals</h2>



<p>Moving to a new city without knowing anyone is intimidating, and you’re brave for taking this step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, once you find your rental and get to know your roommates, it’s time to stretch your wings and explore the neighborhood. The good news is that you have technology by your side. Nowadays, there are plenty of apps that can help you find your tribe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Platforms like Meetup or Bumble BFF make it easier than ever to connect with locals who share your interests, be it book clubs, running groups, or foodie meet-ups. With these digital tools in hand, you&#8217;ll soon find yourself mingling with familiar faces and feeling right at home amidst the urban hustle!</p>



<p>Also, don’t ignore your local community &#8211; big cities often have street festivals or neighborhood gatherings that allow you to connect with people living in the area. And, you’ve guessed it &#8211; there are apps for this, too!</p>



<p>Platforms like Nextdoor or even Facebook groups are a great source of information on local happenings and neighborhood services that can make your life easier. You can find everything from babysitters to pop-up markets on these platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>



<p>With technology at your side, you will be able to effortlessly navigate the bustling urban landscape (even in big cities) and connect with people who have similar interests as you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the right digital tools by your side, you’ll feel empowered to make bold decisions and connect with spaces and people that meet your needs. So go out there and explore!</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com/us/co-living/what-weve-learned-from-processing-over-100000-background-checks/">What we’ve learned from processing over 100,000 background checks</a> appeared first on <a href="https://blog2.roomiapp.com">Roomi | blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Everything we do here at Roomi is focused on making it safer to find a new roommate or new place to live &#8211; so it’s no surprise that we spend a lot of time thinking about the best way to implement identity verification and background check solutions.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Through research and engaging directly with the Roomi community we’ve decided to update the way that Roomi offers background checks.To facilitate this change, we’ve found the perfect partner in <a href="http://www.garbo.io">Garbo</a>. Garbo’s background check platform makes it easy to see if someone has a history of violent or harmful behavior via public records of arrests, convictions, and sex offender registry records. They’ve also published some info on our partnership, which you can read about here.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>We think it’s important to share why we made this decision, but first, let’s dive deeper into why this is a problem worth solving.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p>In a detailed survey conducted of Roomi users, <strong>Safety</strong> was ranked as the most important factor (by a wide margin) for housing/roommate searches &#8211; other factors on the list were Cost, Ease of Use, Speed, and Variety of Options. In fact, <strong>Safety</strong> had twice as many 1st place votes than the next most important factor, which was Ease of Use. Somewhat surprisingly, Variety of Options was ranked as the least important factor, reinforcing the idea that quality is more important than quantity for housing searches!</p>



<p><br><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="672" height="389" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XDzo89qnpXdz8HJt5O_XTlRkrKT2vC9-IJ-FePqaJw2EjUomy6JwkXU5zUdb6pdq2FUQA8I1sajxq778ez9CUKQowama7I_CmsJQYRodidiBMeuc4Wp2dc_NbTec2iNE8EwkR_A6ZkFkkFeqmQ"></p>



<p></p>



<p>The current <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20477882-od6058-background-check-services-industry-report#document/p21/a2017803">US market for landlord tenant screenings</a> is huge (over $3B and growing!), <strong>but this doesn’t account for the millions of people like you who are trying to look for a new roommate safely. </strong>Based on rising rental prices in big cities, a desire for flexibility, affordability, housing tech innovation, etc &#8211; we know that this niche in the market will only keep getting bigger. In the future it seems probable that housing options will be easier to search &#8211; but will it be safer? The logical answer is… only if we provide the right tools to roommates so they can help protect themselves.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Clearly safety is top of mind for renters, but what’s the best way for Roomi to solve this problem?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p>In the same survey mentioned previously, we asked Roomi users to rank the best ways to keep Roomi “safe and trustworthy”. Keep in mind the current feature entails running a Background Check on yourself and receiving a badge if cleared. All other tech or business considerations aside, clearly we were missing an opportunity to improve the trust and safety of the platform by offering the ability for users to run searches and view a full background report of potential roommates.</p>



<p></p>



<p><img decoding="async" width="672" height="389" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8p4qYa6qFrMhxeGzMVTQWYzR_JvMGtxrh3NIypJHjF6xoTkVHxhY9AAYhXQUa5LN5TURqjjErLHM1YOSoGke7XTmBofrrKRPW1LzM-qqDF-003_r-vwsvMU8Gj_aO2xNuRat6hhMD0Th5OC8YQ"></p>



<p></p>



<p>Lastly, it was important for us to understand the general attitudes and views that our users have toward background checks. We’re guided by the idea that Roomi should simply give people the tools they need to make better, more informed decisions for themselves. On the flip side, we also know that, historically, background checks can be deeply flawed, and in the worst cases enable housing discrimination.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Next we asked our users for their view of what criminal offenses, if any, should be considered as appropriate and useful when making a decision on who to live with.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><img decoding="async" width="672" height="444" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ip372IzytLyIjZ2Um5H44n7T4WRBExtLMjXg-BNgmneIKLEVMUa_IZFiptU_7sPIZpEWwpmBd9LABzxolCG2I1P0sk77QqfJPmREaXtedmh2BKKpUqUl0d66M-D8XvUGbNMlZkbuSp5_ue0yGg"></p>



<p>The responses to these questions, especially the last one, gave us a pretty clear indication of two things:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>The current Roomi background check offering was lacking a few important aspects that our users clearly wanted (detailed report, ignore certain offenses)</li><li>We needed to partner with a company that had a more progressive approach to background checks &#8211; ideally getting away from the pass/fail mindset in favor of delivering the nuance, context, and details that are most useful when deciding who to live with.</li></ol>



<p>Although we will never stop innovating or listening to the needs of our community, the direction ahead is clear and we look forward to processing the next 100,000 background checks! </p>

<p><strong>Roomi is for everyone <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>



<p>Roomi helps humans across the world find roommates that get them. We&#8217;re committed to making your housing search easy, safe and welcoming.</p>



<p>This is why we’re expanding our gender options to include “Non-Binary” to better reflect the community we serve.</p>



<p>Our intention is to create a platform that more accurately represents the spectrum of gender expressions, and make it easier for our users to access inclusive housing options.</p>



<p><strong>More options, more belonging</strong></p>



<p>You can edit or update your gender identity on Web by clicking your profile picture, go to “Settings”, and choose one of the gender options available. Available on web only.</p>



<p><strong>Make your search more inclusive</strong></p>



<p>For listers looking for a roommate, edit your listing and update your Roommate Preference to include Non-binary or No preference to connect with all possible roommates. Go to My listings click on the listing you&#8217;d like to update and change the Roommate Preference section.</p>



<p>For movers looking for a room, you can find the Preferred Gender Roommate filter under More Filters.</p>



<p><strong>Come as you are</strong></p>



<p>We&#8217;re committed to making our platform gender-inclusive in language and imagery, so you feel welcomed, cared for, and heard— exactly as you are.</p>

<p>Por eso, ampliamos las opciones de género y agregamos la opción &#8220;No binario&#8221; para representar mejor a nuestra comunidad.</p>



<p>Queremos que nuestra plataforma sea amigable con todas las identidades de género y que nuestros usuarios encuentren hogares donde se sientan bienvenidxs.</p>



<p><strong>Más opciones, más en casa</strong></p>



<p>Para editar o actualizar tu género en la Web, haz click en tu foto de perfil, selecciona &#8220;Configuración&#8221; y elige el género que prefieras. En iOS y Android, selecciona &#8220;Más&#8221;, haz click en tu foto de perfil y selecciona &#8220;Editar&#8221; (lo encontrarás debajo de tu información básica). Si te sientes más cómodx sin mostrar tu identidad de género, recuerda que la opción &#8220;Prefiero no decirlo&#8221; también está disponible.</p>
